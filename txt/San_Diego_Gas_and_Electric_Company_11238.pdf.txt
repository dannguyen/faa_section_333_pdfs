                                                      Exemption No. 11238B
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0719

Mr. Dallas Cormier
CP52E
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
8316 Century Park Court
San Diego, CA 92123

Dear Mr. Cormier:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated June 4, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection1. You requested an amendment to add the DJI Inspire, DJI Spreading Wings S
1000, and Aeryon SkyRanger.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11238
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11238 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the InstantEye Mk-2
         Gen2, InstantEye Mk-2 Gen3, Pulse Aerospace Vapor 35, Vapor 55, PrecisionHawk
         Lancaster Hawkeye, DJI Inspire, DJI Spreading Wings S 100, and Aeryon SkyRanger
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on March 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) received Exemption No. 11238 on March 26,
2015 for the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen2 and amendment approval on May 7, 2015 for Pulse
Aerospace and PrecisionHawk.

SDG&E is requesting this amendment to include additional Unmanned Aircraft models from DJI.
See above, full explanation of Unmanned Aircraft we wish to include in our exemption. DJI has
already received multiple approvals for Section 333, such as Exemption No. 11278, 11225, and
S11252.

There will be no change in the condition and reasons relative to public interest and safety
that were the basis for granting the original exemption. None of our operations would
change; we are just requesting to add additional Unmanned Aircraft to our exemption for
greater flexibility.
