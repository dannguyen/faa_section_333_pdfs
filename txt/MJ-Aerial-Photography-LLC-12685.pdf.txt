                                                           Exemption No. 12685
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2500

Mr. Michael J Miller
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC
533 West Third Street
Charlotte, MI 48813

Dear Mr. Miller:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 2, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of MJ Aerial Photography, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct
commercial cinematic, academic, and other flight operations.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
                                                                                                                 2

aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, MJ Aerial Photography, LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, MJ Aerial Photography, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

 Re: Petition of Michael J Miller owner of MJ Aerial Photography, LLC. for an exemption
                 Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.

Dear Ms,Sir;
       I, Michael Miller, owner of MJ Aerial Photography, LLC, am writing pursuant to the

FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and the procedures contained within 14
C.F.R. 11, to request that MJ Aerial Photography, LLC, owner and operator of small
unmanned aircraft, be exempted from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed
below so that MJ Aerial Photography, LLC may operate a small, ultra light weight
unmanned aircraft system ("UAS") commercially in airspace regulated by the Federal
Aviation Administration ("FAA").

       I have many years and flight experience in helicopter RC Modeling and
photography. I own numerous RC Helicopters and UAS's that are equipment with video
and still camera equipment.

       This exemption would allow MJ Aerial Photography, LLC the capability to operate
UAS's to continue these operations benefiting the community, following exemption and
approval by the FAA.

                                                                                                                                            1
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

         MJ Aerial Photography, LLC utilizes the DJI Phantom 2 UAS. MJ Aerial Photography,
LLC's operations with UAS's will be at minimum altitudes needed to acquire the desired
photographs, and well below the maximum altitude of 400' feet. The majority of these
flights will be accomplished at 200' well below the maximum altitude limit. The base
station for the DJI Phantom 2 provides real-time data: UAS's altitude, GPS position,
number of current satellites being received, bearing, battery levels/health, and will bring
up a screen and sound audible alarms for predetermined altitude limits. The aircraft and
hand held controller feature a built in
"Land Now" or "Return to Home" feature if either the signal or battery are compromised.
This exemption request would permit operation in limited airspace in areas away from
the general public, airports, heliports, and vehicle traffic. All flight data is logged by the
UAS system and all flights will be logged and will be available for any required FAA
reports to assist with future protocol and safety regulations.

Granting MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's request comports with the Secretary of
Transportation's (FAA Administrator's) responsibilities and authority to not only integrate
UAS's into the national airspace system, but to "...establish requirements for the safe
operation of such aircraft systems [UAS's] in the national airspace system" under
Section 333(c) of the Reform Act specific to the use of UAS's for Aerial Photography
purposes. Further MJ Aerial Photography, LLC will conduct operations in compliance
with the protocols described herein or as otherwise established by the FAA. For the
reasons stated below, MJ Aerial Photography, LLC respectfully requests grant of
exemptions allowing me to operate ultra light weight, remote controlled UAS's to
provide aerial images to my customers supporting community awareness to benefit/
stimulate attraction to the State of Michigan. To operate a photography business at
competitive rates, and provide the community safer and less intrusive flights where this
UAS can be effective.. This will promote local economic growth through increased
property sales, employment, and increase tax revenue to the State of Michigan.

III. The Extent of, and Reason for, relief which MJ Aerial Photography, LLC seeks:

I, Michael J Miller, submit this application in accordance with the Reform Act, 112 P.L. 95
§§ 331-334, seeking relief from any currently applicable FARs operating to prevent my
company, MJ Aerial Photography, LLC, contemplated commercial cinematic, academic
and other flight operations within the national airspace system. The Reform Act in
Section 332 provides for such integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into our
national airspace system as it is in the public's interest to do so. MJ Aerial Photography,
LLC's ultra light weight UAS meets the definition of "small unmanned aircraft" as defined
in Section 331 and therefore the integration of my ultra light weight UAS is expressly
contemplated by the Reform Act. I would like to operate my ultra light weight UAS prior
to the time period by which the Reform Act requires the FAA to promulgate rules
governing such craft. Thereby, providing direct experience and valuable information for
formal regulation that can be administered uniformly to all related UAS aerial video and
photography. The Reform Act guides the Secretary in determining the types of UAS's
that may operate safely in our national airspace system. Considerations include: The
weight, size, speed and overall capabilities of the UAS's; Whether the UAS will be
operated near airports or heavily populated areas; and, Whether the UAS will be
operated by line of sight. 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (a). Each of these items reflect in favor of an
exemption for MJ Aerial Photography, LLC. MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's UAS utilizes
four (4) counter rotating propellers for balance, control and stability. It is equipped with
GPS and auto return safety technology. Weighing less than three (3) pounds (far below
the maximum 55 pound limit); including camera with gimbal.
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC considers safety as foremost with each flight. My small
unmanned aircraft is designed to hover in place via GPS and operate in less than a 23
mph wind. For safety, stability and fear of financial loss I will not fly in winds exceeding
10 mph. Built in safety systems include a GPS mode that allows my UAS to hover in
place when radio controls are released. When pilot communication is lost UAS is
designed slowly descend to point of take off. I do not operate my UAS near

                                                                                                                                            3
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

Airports, Hospitals nor Police Heliports, and do not operate near areas where general
public is within fifty to one hundred (50-100) yards depending on location, conditions
and weather. I am constantly on alert for any manned aircraft (Police/Medical
Helicopters, etc.) and prepared to land/abort immediately to the nearest and safest
ground point should a manned aircraft approach my location or I suspect manned
aircraft may approach near my location. My UAS is capable of vertical and horizontal
operations, and are flown only within my line of sight of me, as the remote control pilot.
Utilizing battery power flights generally last between three (3) to seven (7) minutes, with
an altitude under two hundred (200) feet. I utilize a fresh fully charged battery with each
flight as a safety precaution; full flight time limit for each battery is ten (10) to thirteen
(13) minutes as tested. I do not operate my UAS at or below manufacture recommend
minimum charge levels for operation; preferring to remain well within a safe operating
range to insure adequate communication between radio control and UAS to eliminate
potential for crash, loss of control or hazard. Reserve batteries are at hand with each
exercise to insure replacement for sufficient safe level of operation. I do not believe in
taking risk that may cause a crash, that could create hazard to the public/property/
manned aircraft, and have no desire to lose a significant investment. I have clocked
numerous practice flights in remote areas as a hobbyist simulating flights for future
commercial use to gain familiarization with the characteristics of this specific UAS's
performance under different temperature and weather conditions. I also practice
computerized simulated flights to maintain adequate skills and response reflex time. All
for the sake of safety.

I, Michael J Miller, am extremely cautious when operating of my UAS/ultra light weight
unmanned aircraft and will not "create a hazard to users of the national airspace system
or the public." 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (b). Given the small size and weight of my UAS it falls
well within Congress's contemplated safety zone when it promulgated the Reform Act
and the corresponding directive to integrate UAS's into the national airspace system.

IV. How MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's Request Will Benefit the Public As A Whole:
Aerial Photography/Videography for geographical awareness and for land development
and marketing has provided companies with over views of projects giving a clear vision
for future developments.
Congress has already proclaimed that it is in the public's interest to integrate
commercially flown UAS's into the national airspace system, hence the passing of the
Reform Act. Granting MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's exemption request furthers the
public interest through academic/visual awareness of the geographical benefits in and
around the State of Michigan. It provides Michigan realtors a safe and reasonably priced
option to acquire Aerial Images without them purchasing cheap UAS's and considering
operating without meeting FAA requirements, putting themselves and the public in
danger. My ultra light weight UAS is battery powered and creates no emissions that can
harm the environment. The consequence of my ultra light weight UAS crashing is far
less than a full size helicopter or fixed wing aircraft; which are heavy, contain
combustible fuel and can cause catastrophic devastation to the public.

                                                                                                                                            4
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

The public's interest is furthered by minimizing ecological and crash threat by permitting
aerial video/photo capture through my battery operated ultra light weight UAS's.
permitting MJ Aerial Photography, LLC to immediately fly within national air space
furthers economic growth. Granting my exemption request substantially furthers the
economic impact for Michigan companies looking to build projects in the area assisting
in geographical awareness. Which serve as a stimulus to the community

V. Reasons Why MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's Exemption Will Not Adversely
Affect Safety Or How The Exemption Will Provide a Level of Safety At Least Equal
To Existing Rule:
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's exemption will not adversely affect safety. Quite the

contrary, for the reasons stated permitting me, Michael J Miller, to log more flight time in

FAA controlled airspace, with communication with the FAA, will allow me to contribute to

the innovation and implementation of new and novel, as of yet undiscovered safety

protocols for development in cooperation with the FAA. In addition MJ Aerial

Photography, LLC submit the following representations of enhancements to current

aerial videography and photography:

1. My UAS weight is (35oz)(2.18lbs) with a payload capacity:18oz and a Maximum

Gross Take-off-weight: 53oz(3.31pounds).

2. I only operate my UAS below 200 feet (well within the 400 foot permissible ceiling set
       by the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012);

3. My UAS only operate for 7-10 minutes per flight;
4. I land my UAS prior to manufacturer recommended minimum level of battery power;

       and the base station controller provides two popup critical battery level warning

screens.

5. I pilot my UAS through remote control only by line of sight and with a VO (visual
       observer).

6. My UAS has GPS a flight safety feature whereby it hovers and then slowly lands if
       communication with the remote control pilot is lost;

7.I actively analyze flight data and other sources of information to constantly update and
       enhance safety protocols;

8. I only operate in reasonably safe environment that are strictly controlled, are away
       from power lines, elevated lights, airports and actively populated areas;

9. I conduct extensive pre-flight inspections and protocol, during which safety carries

primary importance.

10. I always obtains all necessary permissions prior to operation.
11. I have procedures in place to abort flights in the event of safety breaches or

    potential danger.
12. I will not operate in any flight conditions that exceed the manufacturers

    recommended flight limitations.

13. I purchase current Sectional Aeronautical Charts and fly
    o nly within the established limitations granted me by the

FAA.

14. I will contact the local Airport and get ATIS information and prior to operations     5
    request a notice to airmen (NOTAM) for pilots in the NAS.

15. I will not fly over congested areas and will maintain 500'
    feet distance from persons, vehicles, vessels and

structures.
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's safety protocols provide a level of safety equal to or
exceeding existing rules.

1. The potential loss of life is diminished because UAS's carry no people on board and I
            only operates my UAS in specific areas away from mass populations.

2. Second, there is no fuel on board a UAS and thus the potential for fire or explosions
       is greatly diminished.

3. Third, the small size and extreme maneuverability of my UAS allow me to remotely
       pilot away from and avoid hazards quickly and safely.

4. Lastly, given its small size and weight, even when close enough to capture amazing
       images, my UAS need not be so close to the objects they are focused on through

the technology and use of post editing software allowing pan and zoom. Accordingly,
my UAS has been experimentally operated for familiarization/competency and will
continue to operate at and above current safety levels.

VI. A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:

A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like.

14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for
procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1).
The size, weight and enclosed operational area of MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's UAS
permits exemption from Part 21 because my UAS meets (and exceeds) an equivalent
level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act.
The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement
under both the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both
pieces of legislation permit the FAA to exempt UAS's from the airworthiness certificate
requirement in consideration of the weight, size, speed, maneuverability and proximity
to areas such as airports and dense populations. MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's current
and projected UAS's meet or exceed each of the elements.

14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness
certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the
FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable.

                                                                                                                                            6
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no
on board pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is
inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a safety/flight
manual delineating areas of where safety can be defined. The FAA has previously issued
exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565,
9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 10700 and 32827.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121 regarding altimeter settings is inapplicable insofar as my UAS utilizes
electronic global positioning systems with a barometric sensor.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b) provides for the carrying of civil aircraft certifications and
registrations. They are inapplicable for the same reasons described above. The
equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining any such required certifications
and registrations by me, Michael J Miller of MJ Aerial Photography, LLC.

14 C.F.R. § 45.23: Marking of The Aircraft.
Applicable Codes of Federal Regulation require aircraft to be marked according to certain
specifications. MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's UAS are, by definition, unmanned. They
therefore do not have a cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or
phrases. Further, two-inch lettering is difficult to place on such small aircraft with
dimensions smaller that minimal lettering requirement. Regardless, I will mark its UASs in
the largest possible lettering by placing the word "EXPERIMENTAL" on its fuselage as
required by 14 C.F.R. §45.29 (f) so that I the pilot, or anyone assisting me as a spotter
with the UAV will see the markings. The FAA has previously issued exemptions to this
regulation through Exemptions Nos. 8738, 10167, 10167A and 10700.

14 C.F.R. § 61.113: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: PIC.

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113 (a) & (b), private pilots are limited to non-commercial
operations. MJ Aerial Photography, LLC can achieve an equivalent level of safety as
achieved by current Regulations because my UAS does not carry any pilots or
passengers. The risks attended to the operation of my UAS is far less than the risk levels
inherent in the commercial activities outlined in 14 C.F.R. § 61, et seq. Thus, allowing
me, Michael J Miller, to operate my UAS meet and exceed current safety levels in
relation to 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) & (b).

14 C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

                                           7
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

14 C.F.R. § 91.119 prescribes safe altitudes for the operation of civil aircraft. It allows
helicopters to be operated at lower altitudes in certain conditions. My UAS will never
operate at an altitude greater than 400 AGL; I, Michael J Miller, will operate my UAS in
safe areas away from public and traffic, providing a level of safety at least equivalent to
or below those in relation to minimum safe altitudes. Given the size, weight,
maneuverability and speed of my UAS, an equivalent or higher level of safety will be
achieved.

14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a)(1) & (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance
Inspections.
C.D.E.

The above-cited Regulations require, amongst other things, aircraft owners and
operators to "have [the] aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and
shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,
have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter. . . ."
These Regulations only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. They will not,
therefore, apply to MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's UAS. However, as a safety precaution I
inspect my UAS before and after each flight and have had it serviced and upgraded by
the manufacturer.
A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register: A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14
C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like. 14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H,
entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for procurement of necessary
airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1). The size, weight and
enclosed operational area of my UAS permits exemption from Part 21 because MJ Aerial
Photography, LLC's UAS meets an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of
the Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness
certificate requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the
Reform Act. Both pieces of legislation permit the FAA to exempt UAS's from the
airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the weight, size, speed,
maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense populations. MJ
Aerial Photography, LLC's UAS meets or exceeds each of the elements. 14 C.F.R.
91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. As no
such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the FARs, this Regulation
is inapplicable. 14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As
there are no pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is
inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a manual. The
FAA has previously issued exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737,
8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, maintenance program that involves regular
software updates and curative measures for any damaged hardware. Therefore, an
equivalent level of safety will be achieved.

                                                                                                                                            8
MJ Aerial Photography, LLC - Section 333 Exemption Petition

In summary, MJ Aerial Photography, LLC seeks an exemption from the following
Regulations:
14 C.F.R. 21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113 (a) & (b); 14 C.F.R. §

C.F.R. § 91.405 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.407 (a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409 (a)(2); 14 C.F.R. §
91.409 (a ) (2); and, 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.417 (a) & (b)
To commercially operate small unmanned vehicle/lightweight unmanned aircraft for
photographic operations in support of the local real estate market, providing community
awareness and help develop economic platforms for companies in The State of
Michigan. I operate at low altitudes and in controlled airspace eliminating potential
public risk. These operations will allow the business community an alternative to using
full size helicopters there by providing a more economical, safer, and less intrusive
method to acquiring there promotional sales materials.
I, Michael J Miller, have been analyzing flight information and will compile safety
protocols and the implementation of a flight operations manual for Aerial Photography
usage that exceeds currently accepted means and methods for safe flight. Formal
collection of information shared with the FAA will enhance the FAA's internal efforts to
establish protocols for complying with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.
There are no personnel on board MJ Aerial Photography, LLC's UAS and therefore the
likelihood of death or serious bodily injury is significantly diminished. My, Michael J
Miller's operation of my UAS, weighing less than 5 pounds and traveling at lower
speeds within limited areas will provide an equivalent level of safety as that achieved
under current FARs. Accordingly, MJ Aerial Photography respectfully request that the
FAA grant my exemption request and I am willing to cooperate in sharing information to
benefit the FAA, the safety of manned aircraft, and the general public at large.
