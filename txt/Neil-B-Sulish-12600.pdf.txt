                                                           Exemption No. 12600
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2355

Mr. Neil B. Sulish
2006 Long Beach Boulevard
Surf City, NJ 08008

Dear Mr. Sulish:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 30, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial evaluation of infrastructure and videography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 3 Professional and DJI Inspire 1.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
                                                                                           2

Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Neil B. Sulish is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Neil B. Sulish is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3
         Professional and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
         Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
         amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.

RE: Request for exemption from multiple regulatory provisions to allow the use of
small unmanned aerial systems on land controlled by clients of mine to assist in the
safe evaluation of infrastructure and operations for my future clients

Dear Mr. Crozier,

I Neil B Sulish respectfully request an exemption from several provisions of Title 14
of the Code of Federal Regulations {C.F.R.) to permit the use of small unmanned
aerial systems {sUAS) to assist in the evaluation of infrastructure of operations for
my clients. Also in filming various functions for my Mure clients in the field of Real
Estate, outdoor weddings, and outdoor water-sports i.e.. surfing. Accordingly, the
grant of an exemption is consistent with Congress' intent, reflected in Section 333
of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 {Modernization Act),, that safe
systems be permitted in the national airspace prior to the issuance of final
regulations governing general use of these systems.2 A summary of this request

suitable for Publication in the Federal Register is provided as Appendix A.

Appendix B provides the manufacturers information regarding the design, aircraft
performance, and fail-safe features. I have provided the information related to
operating limitations, normal and emergency procedures, and maintenance and .
inspection procedures. As I add aircraft designs, I will update this appendix
appropriately. Also, provides the manual for flights covered under this Exemption
Request.

1P.L 112-95, stat 11, February 14.2012

2Section 333(b) (2) specifically contemplates that the FAA may issue a certificate of waiver upon ffnding that a type of
UAS, as a result of size, weight, speed, operational capacity, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operations
within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security.
Background Information

I plan on working in the Real Estate Industry, outdoor weddings, and outdoor
sporting activities over water i.e. surfing.

I have been contacted by many future clients looking for me to operate sUAS for
their business needs.

Infrastructure Safetv Inspection Operations:

    Roof inspection

    Construction Companies' Projects

     Agriculture (farm crop inspection

     Solar panel inspection

As a part of this I am requesting FAA Exemption for sUAS operations for safety,
inspection and video capture usage.

Regulatory Basis for Exemption Request

In addition to the waiver authority provided in Section 333 of the Modernization Act,
the FAA may grant an emption under 49 U.S.C. §44701 (f) if it has determined that
such an exemption is in the public interest. The FAA has imposed a separate
requirements it procedural regulations, providing that the petitioner shall explain why
granting the exemption would not adversely affect safety or how the exemption
would provide at least an equivalent level of safety as compliance with the
underlying regulation.

Granting an Exemption will not Adversely Affect Safetv

I do note that there is no applicable standard for an equivalency determination.
Some have argued that the appropriate standard is that for model aircraft, noting
that their operations, if conducted for recreational purposes, would fall completely
within the allowable operations for model aircraft. I believe it is difficult to argue that
there is sufficient correlation between model operations controlled by the Academy
of Model Aeronautics and the ones contemplated by myself. At the same time , it is
clear that equivalency cannot be established for traditional, manned civil aircraft
because the design and use profiles between traditional aircraft and sUAS are
contemplated operations would not adversely affect safety, which is all that
§11.81 (e) requires.

Granting an exemption will not adversely affect safety. I contemplate conducting
sUAS operations over client owned or controlled land, solely during daylight hours,
at altitudes well below that which would pose a risk presented by standard
infrastructure operations, my clients already have taken steps to secure property
against unauthorized public access. For example, substantial stretches of pipeline,
utilities, railroad tracks, solar farms, and other sites, are usually fenced, elevated, or
otherwise secured to prevent access. Other long stretches of interest are, as noted
above could be in wilderness areas. Most of my anticipated work will be on
privately owned real estate developments, outdoor venues, private large farms and
over bodies of water. The nature of operations that I anticipate requires that the
sUAS be flown at relatively low speeds. I expect that in most instances, the sUAS
will be flown less than 75 feet from the highest structure along the path of the sUAS.
Accordingly, the risk of interference with another aircraft is minimal. I plan to
conduct sUAS operations at least 3 miles from a any public airports (including
heliports).

Approval of exemption allowing commercial operation of sUAS in the infrastructure
aerial inspection industry, outdoor sporting events, construction projects, and
outdoor wedding venues will enhance safety by reducing risk. Conventional
operations, using jet or piston power aircraft, operate a extremely low altitudes just
feet from the subject being inspected or filmed and in extreme proximity to people
and structures: and present the risks associated with vehicles that weigh in the
neighborhood of 4,000 lbs., carrying large amounts of jet A or other fuel (140
gallons for jet helicopters). such aircraft must fly to and from the job site. In
contrast, a sUAS weighing fewer than 55 lbs. and powered by batteries eliminates
virtually all of that risk given the reduced mass and lack of combustable fuel carried
on board. The uSAS is carried to the site. the sUAS will carry no passengers or
crew and, therefore, till not expose them to the risk associated with manned flights.

The operation of small UASs, weighing less than 551bs., conducted in the strict
conditions outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the
grant of the exemptions requested herein, including 333 Aircraft Exemption Status
exempting the applicant from conventional aircraft requirements and allowing
commercial operations. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to
the ground,and in a controlled environment and, as a result, are far safer than
conventional operations conducted with turbine helicopters operating in close
proximity to the ground and people.

The safety of this on the ground is protected by the fact that no one will be allowed
into the area without permission of the landowner. Security will be established for
the flight area as part of the pre-flight control. Each individual within the secure area
will be briefed prior to flight and will consent to being in the area.

I initially intend to use myself as the dedicated pilot for all sUAS operations. All
operations will be within the visual line-of-sight {i.e. no more than approximately 0.5
miles from the manipulator of the controls {myself), or pilot in command {PIC myself).
As PIC I will conduct at least three take-offs and landings with the sUAS on which I
was trained every 90 days as a minimum. As PIC I will establish my qualifications
thru a combination of aeronautical knowledge, UAS airmanship skill, and verification
through established protocol before any operations commence. Depending on the
type of operation, additional ground-based visual observers may be employed as
well. These observers will be within constant visual line of sight and in constant
contact with the PIC. The visual observers will assist the PIC in avoiding objects
near the sUAS.

There are no standards for either Private or Commercial sUAS pilot certificates. The
safe operation and control of the UAS as described in this application dow not
depend on the type of FAA license held by the PIC. Given the restricted and
controlled airspace within which operations will take place, the key factors needed
by the PIC are knowledge of the airspace within which the operation will take place
and how that airspace fits into the National Airspace System {NAS). That
knowledge can be and is gained primarily through ground school and not though
flight training in fixed wing aircraft, has the skill or ability to safely operate a small
unmanned aerial vehicle, operating at 400 AGL or lower, within a strictly controlled
pre-approved airspace. Besides knowledge of airspace regulations, dexterity in the
control and operation of the sUAS acquired from actual operation of the aircraft is
the most important factor in establishing an equivalent level of safety.

If the PIC has acquired the necessary knowledge of airspace requirements, the
relevant issues are {1) where the aircraft will be flown, {2) the size of the aircraft
relative to what is being used today to accomplish the same mission, and {3) what
precautions will be taken to ensure the safety of those in the area of operation. I
propose that the aircraft be operated within a secure environment; and that no one
be allowed to enter the secure environment unless the are part of the operation of
the sUAS, and have consented to the risk associated with being in the operating
area. Should there be a mishap, the sUAS being flown pose significantly less of a
threat than the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft now being employed because
they are a fraction of the size, carry no flammable fuel, do not carry crew or
passengers, and pose an infinitesimal risk to others. This is in stark contrast to
conventional aircraft that are flown to the site, carry explosive fuel, carry passengers
and crew, and operate in a much larger area.

From a practical standpoint, there are relatively few licensed full-scale aircraft pilots
who are also qualified to fly the type of sUAS that are utilized for infrastructure and
other image capture operations. There are even fewer commercial pilots that can fly
these sUAS- to the point that to do both is considered rare. Assuming that it is
unlikely for a company to find a pilot that has both qualifications, that company
would either have to source a qualified sUAS pilot to train and obtain a commercial
certificate, or find a commercial certificated pilot who would be willing to learn to fly
a sUAS to the competency level required for professional use.

Minimum requirements for the PIC include:

1. A minimum of 200 flight cycles and 25 hours of total time as a sUAS rotorcraft
     pilot and at least 10 logged as a sUAS pilot with a similar sUAS type (single
     blade or multi-rotor);

2. A minimum of 5 hours as sUAS pilot with the make and model of sUAS to be
     utilized for operations under the exemption and 3 take offs and landings in the
     preceding 90 days;

3. Have undergone a qualification process as specified in the Flight Operations &
     Procedures Manual consisting of a knowledge & skill test the aircraft to be used.

I intend to use commercially available sUAS Components for sUAS. These sUAS
systems will be tested for quality & safety under controlled conditions before being
used in the field. The sUAS is less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a pilot
nor a passenger, and operates exclusively within a secured area. I have a routine
maintenance schedule to verify that the sUAS will remain in safe and operational
condition. Please see Appendix B, for Specific Types of sUAS.
Notes regarding: 14 C.F.R. Part 21. Subpart H

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of PL 112-95 in
reference to 49 USC 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and
limited operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation , we request
that's aircraft exemption meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore , if granted
Section 333 relief of 14 CFR part 21 , and any accosted noise certification and
testing requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Notes regarding: 14 C.F.R. § 45.23(bl. Marking of the Aircraft

Given the size of the sUAV, two inch lettering will be impossible, UAS will be
identified by serial number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have
identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C.
Markings will be as large as practicable.

Notes regarding: 14 CFR § 91.7(al Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

My request is based on the fact tat no airworthiness certificate will be issued for the
UAS. My UAS will not require an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14
CFR part 21, subpart H. Based on the fact that an airworthiness certificate will not
be issued, exemption from§ 91.7(a) is not necessary.

Notes Regarding: 14 CFR§91.9(bl(2lCivil aircraft flight manuaL marking and placard

Certifications required, the original intent these regulations was to display an
aircraft's airworthiness, certification, and registration documents so they would be
easily available to inspectors and passengers. Based on the FAA Memorandum
subject "Interpretation regarding whether certain required documents may be kept
at an unmanned aircraft's control station," dated August 8, 2014, the requested
relief from 14 CFR §§ 91 .9(b)(2) and 91 .203(a) and (b) is not necessary.

Notes Regarding: §91.109 Flight instruction: Simulated instrument & certain flight
test

Small UASs, by their design, do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control
is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the
aircraft via radio communications. Aircraft being considered for use by me allow the
UAS Instructor to place the aircraft into "loiter" mode (fixed altitude stationary hold).
In the event of the student losing control, the UAS instructor can quickly and via
alternate equipment (equipment not in the hands of the student) place the aircraft
into a mode that then allows the instructor to bring the aircraft back into control and
back to the pre-determined and/or safe landing location.

I do not describe training scenarios in which a dual set of controls would be utilized
or required, i.e. dual flight instruction, provided by a flight instructor or other
company-designed individual, that would require that individual to have fully
functioning dual controls. Rather, I would evaluate the qualification of its PIGs based
on their experience with the UAS to be operated and verifies through testing, in lieu
of formalized training. As such, I do not seek relief from 14 CFR § 91.109.

Notes Regarding§ 14 CFR 91.119(bl

Relief from § 14 CFR 91 .119(b), operation over congested areas is not applicable,
because the operations performed will only be conducted within the secure area
described herein.
My safety Operations & Procedures Overview:

Technology Considerations:

Best in class, tried and proven technologies that are in advanced iterations.
Software from highly-reputable industry partners will include feature-

1. Auto descent (landing) if communication signal were to be severed. If the sUAS
      loses communications, the sUAS will have the capability to return to a pre-
     determined location within the security perimeter and land.

2. Auto descent (landing) if battery were to drop lower than nominal level.

3. Flights will be terminated at 25%battery power reserve.

4. Live video for the operator gives real-time positioning feedback. Another words,
      I can monitor the scene from the vehicle's perspective for collision avoidance,
      and to maintain spatial orientation.

5. The sUAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unpredicted

      obstacles or emergencies.

6. On-Screen-display (OSD) contains operating information to ascertain vehicle
      health at all times: speed, altitude,number of GPS satellites (when available),
      heading, and voltage.

7. GPS Lock supplies for return-to-home (RTH). Should command and Control
      (C2) link failures occur (highly improbable), vehicle returns automatically to the
      point of launch.

8. Altitude information will be provided to the sUAS pilot via a digitally encoded

      telemetric data feed, which downlinks from the aircraft to a a ground-based on-
      screen display. This altitude information will be generated by equipment
      installed on board the aircraft, using GPS triangulation, digitally encoded
      barometric altimeter, or radio altimeter, or any combination thereof. Prior to
      each flight, a zero altitude initiation point will be established and confirmed for
      accuracy by the Pilot.
Mechanicai/Phvsical:

1. I will fly in Une-of-sight (LOS) only. The vehicle will always remain in direct LOS
     to the pilot, thus eliminating the concern of signal severance (flying behind
     objects/walls).

2. The sUAS will with less than 551bs and travel at less than 50 knots.

3. Batteries should far exceed the capacity required for the actual flight time.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.

5. Fireproof bags for storage and charging of high capacity Upo batteries on-site.

6. UA operated under this exemption will be marked in accordance with 14 CFR
     part 45 or as otherwise authorized by the FAA.

Personel:

1. Spotters ensure safe iteration and act as a redundant set of eyes for operators
     {pilot, gimbal op, director.

2. Radio spectrum analysis for interference on the frequencies utilized for vehicle
     control/communication.

3. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to
     each day's activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be
     performing duties within the boundaries of the safety perimeter be present for
     this briefing.

4. The operator will obtain consent of all persons involved in the sUAS operations
     and ensure that only consenting persons will be allowed within 100 feet of the
     flight operations.

5. Observer and pilot will at all times be able to communicate by voice.

6. Written and/or permission from the relevant property holders will be obtained.

7. Pilot and observer will have been trained in operate of UAS generally and
     received up-to-date information on the particular UAS to be operated.
Operations:

1. The unmanned aircraft (UA) must weigh less than 55 pounds (25 Kg), including
     energy source(s) and equipment. Operations authorized by this petition of
     exemption are limited to the following aircraft described in Appendix B.
     Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition
     amendment to this request.

2. Th UA may not be flown at a ground speed exceeding 50 knots.

3. Flights must be operate at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground
     level (AGL), as indicated by the procedures specified in the operator's manual.
     All altitudes reported ago ATC must be in feet AGL.

4. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all
     times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any
      device other than corrective lenses.

5. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The VO may be used to
      satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
      capability. The VO and Pic must be able to communicate verbal at all times.

6. The operator's manual included as Appendix C and this petition of exemption
      must be maintained and made available to the Administrator upon request. If a
      discrepancy exist between the conditions and limitations in this exemption and
     the procedures outlined in the operator's manual, the conditions and limitations
      herein take precedence and must be followed. Otherwise, the operator must
      follow the procedures as outlined in its operator's manual.
      The operator may update or revise its operator'd manual. It is the operator's
      responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
      documents to the Administrator upon request. The operator must also present
      updated and revised casements if i petitions for extension or amendment. If the
      operator determines that any update or revision would affect the basis for which
      the FAA grants this petition for exemption, ten the operator must petition for
      amendment to their exemption. The FAA's UAS Integrations Office (AFS-80)
      may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the
      operator's manual.
7. Prior to each flight the PIC must inspect the UAS to ensure it is in a condition for
     safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of
     the UAS, the aircraft is prohibited from operating until the necessary
     maintenance has been performed and the UAS is found to be in a condition for
     safe flight. The Ground Control Station, if utilized, ,must be included in the pre-
     flight inspection. All maintenance and alterations must be properly documented
      in the aircraft records.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance of alterations that affect the UAS
     operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical
      component, must undergo a functional test flight in accordance with the
      operator's manual. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight must make
      an entry in the UAS aircraft records of the flight. The requirements and
      procedures for a functional test flight and aircraft record entry must be added to
     the operator's manual.

9. The operator must follow the manufacturer's UAS aircraft/component,

      maintenance, overhaul, replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements.
     When unavailable, aircraft maintenance/componenVoverhaul, replacement, and
      inspection/maintenance requirements must be established and identified in the
      operator's manual. At a minimum, requirements for the following must be
      included in the operator's manual:
      -Actuators/servos;

-Transmission (single rotor);

-Powerplant (motors);

-Electronic speed controller;

-Batteries;

-Mechanical dynamic components (single rotor)

-Remote command and control;

-Ground Control station (if used); and

-Any other components as determined by the operator;
10. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of infrastructure inspectrosm the
     PIC must have accumulated and logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR §
     61 .51 (b). a minimum of 200 flight cycles and 25 hors of total time as a UAS
     rotorcraft Pilot and at least 10 hours logged as a UAS pilot with a similar UAS
     type (single blade or multi rotor). Prior documented flight experience that was
     obtained in compliance with applicable regulations my satisfy their requirement.
     Training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
     flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the
     UA withe appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR
     § 91.119.

11. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of infrastructure inspection, the
     PIC must have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with 14 CFR §
     61 .51 (b). a minimum of five hours as UAS pilot operations the make and model
     of UAS to be utilized of operations under the exemption and three take-offs and
     three landings in the preceding 90 days. Training, proficiency, experience-
     building, and take-off and landing currency flights can be conducted under this
     piton of exemption to accomplish the required flight time and 90 day currency.
     During training, proficiency, experience-building, and take-off and landing
     currency flights all persons not essential for flight operations are considered
     non-participants, and the PIC must operate the UA with appropriate distance
     from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

12. Prior to any flight apparitions authorized by this petition of exemption, the PIC
     and VO must have successfully completed a qualification process, as outlined in
     the operator's manual. As this is a requirement stipulated by the operator, the
     test must be developed and implemented by a qualified person designated at
     the sole discretion of the operator. A record of completion of this qualification
     process must be documented and made available to the Administrator upon
     request.

13. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of infrastructure inspection, a
     flight demonstration, administered by an operator-approved and -qualified pilot
     must be successfully completed and documented. This documentation must
      be available for review upon request by the Administrator. Because the
      knowledge and airmanship test qualifications have been developed by the
     operator, and there are no established practical test standards that support a
     jurisdictional FAA FSDO evaluation and approval of company designed
     examiners, the petitioner will conduct these test in accordance with the
     operator's manual.

14. The UA may not be operated over any person, except authorized and
     consenting personnel, below an altitude that is hazardous to persons or
     property on the surface in the event of a UAS failure or emergency.

15. Regarding the distance form participating persons, the operator's manual has
     safety mitigations for authorized and consenting personnel. At all times, those
     persons must be essential to operations.

16. Regarding distance from nonparticipating persons, the operator must ensure
     that no persons are allowed within 500 feet of the area except those consenting
     to be involved and necessary for the operation being performed. This provision
     may be reduced to no less than 200 feet if it would not adversely affect safety
     and the Administrator has approved it. For example, an equivalent level of
     safety may be determined b y an aviation safety inspector's evaluation of the
     infrastructure inspection area to note terrain features, obstructions, buildings,
     safety barriers, etc. Such barriers may protect nonparticipating persons
     (obseNers, the public, news media, etc.) from debris in the event of an
     accident.

17. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to
      a pre-determined location within the security perimeter and land or be
      recovered in accordance with the operator's manual.

18. The UAS must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or
      emergencies in accordance with the operator's manual.

19. Each UAS operation must be completed with 25% battery power remaining.

20. The Operator must obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate
      Waiver or Authorization (GOA) prior to conducting any operations under this
      petition of exemption. This GOA will also require the operator to request a
      Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but not less
      than 48 hours prior to the operation.

21. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by
      serial number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have
     identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart
     C. Markings must be as large as practicable.

22. The operator must develop procedures to document and maintain a record of
     the UAS maintenance, preventative maintenance, alterations, status of
     replacement/overhaul component parts, and the total time in service of the
      UAS. These procedures must be added to the operator's manual.

23. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
      Safety bulletins.

24. The operator must develop UAS technician qualification criteria. These criteria
      must be added to the operators manual.

25. The preflight inspection section in the operator's manual must be amended to
      include the following requirement: The preflight inspection must account for all
      discrepancies, i.e. inoperable compost, items or equipment, not covered in the
      relevant preflight inspection sections of the operator's manual

26. Before conducting operations, the radio frequency spectrum used for operation
      and control of the UA must comply with the Federal Communications
      Commission (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency
      requirements.

27. At least 3 days before scheduled flight the operator of the UAS affected by this
      exemption must have a written Plan of Activities.
      The Plan of Activities must include at least the following: Dates and Times of
      proposed flight; Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS; name
      and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of the
      UAS; Make, model, and serial number or N-Number of UAS to be used; Name
      and certificate number of UAS PIGs involved in the event; a statement that the
      operator obtained permission from property owners and/or local officials if
      applicable; Signature of Exemption holder and a description of the flight activity,
      including maps of affected areas and altitudes essential to accomplish the
      operation.

28. The documents require under 14 CFR §§ 91 .1 and 91 .203 must be available to
      the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is
     operating. These documents must be made available to the Administrator or
     any law enforcement official upon request.

29. The UA must remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned
     operations and activities at all times (including, but not limited to, ultralight
     vehicles, parachute activities, parasailing activities, hang gliders, etc.).

30. UAS operations may not be conducted during the night, as defined in 14 GFR §
      1.1 . All operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions
      (VMC). Flights under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

31. The UA may not operate in class B, G, or D airspace without written approval
     from the FAA. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of the geographic
     center of non-towered airport as denoted on a current FAA-published
     aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement within the airport's management
     is obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM as
     required by the operator's GOA. The letter of agreement with the airport
     management must be made available to the Administrator upon request.

32. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
     boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable GOA must be
     reported to the FAAs UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.
     Accidents must be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
     per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov. Further flight
      operations may not be conducted until the incident, accident, or transgression
     is reviewed by AFS-8- and authorization to resume operations I provided.

Regulatory Provisions from which I seek an Exemption

I believe it may need an exemption from the following provisions to conduct the
contemplated operations. In some instances, relief is needed because relief form
another provisions renders compliance with the regulation at hand infeasible.

333 Aircraft Exemption Status
14 C.F.R. §61.113(a) and (b)
14 C.F.R. §91.119(c)
14 C.F.R. §91.121
14 C.F.R. §91.151
14 C.F.R. §91.405(a)
14 C.F.R. §91.407(a)
14 C.F.R. §91.409(a)(1 )&(2)
14 C.F.R. §91.417(a)&(b)
I believe an exemption is only needed form the above-listed regulatory provisions. To
the extent that the FAA believes that additional relief is required for me to conduct
the operations described here, I request an exemption from any such regulatory
provisions as well.

The Extent of Requested Relief and the Reasons Relief is Needed

Section 333 Aircraft Exemption Status:

Section 333 of the Modernization Act authorizes the FAA to exempt the aircraft from
the requirement for an airworthiness certificate based on a consideration of the size,
weight, speed, operational capability of the particular UAS, as well as its proximity to
airports and populated areas. An analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the
sUAS operated without an airworthiness certificate in the areas and under the
conditions contemplated by myself will be at least as safe, or safer, than a
conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness
certificate without the conditions proposed in this request.

The sUAS is less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a pilot nor passenger, and
operates exclusively within a secured area. Unlike other civil aircraft, operations
under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by the operator and
observer. Operations will be conducted in compliance within the FAA and with local
public safety requirements to provide security for the area of operation as is now
done with conventional equipment, infrastructure, bridge and out building
evaluation. These safety enhancements provide an expanded degree of safety to
the inspectors over conventional operations. Lastly, application of these same
criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security posed by
the sUAS due to its size, speed of operation, lack of explosive materials and inability
to carry an extensive external load.

Given the size and limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized
by the Applicant, this meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under
Part 11 and Sections 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.
§44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt
aircraft for the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the
size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and populated
areas of the particular sUAS. In all cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates
that the UAS operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the restricted
environment and under the conditions proposed will be at least safe, or safer, than a
conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness
certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.
14 C.F.R. §61 .113(a) and (b)

           §61.113 Private Pilot privileges and limitations: Pilots in command.

           (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, no
         person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of
         an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensations or hire;
         nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an
         aircraft.

         (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of
         an aircraft in connection with any business of employment if:

           (1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and

           (2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or
         hire.

           I plan on conducting all sUAS operations, while I do not hold a commercial
pilot license, the sUAS will not carry property for compensation or hire since it will be
used solely to perform operations at hand. Without an exemption, I would be
required to hold a commercial pilot certificate under §61.133. However, the risk
associated with the contemplated operations is less than the risk posed by a
traditional aircraft. The sUAS will fly at altitudes well below the permissible limits for
other civil aircraft, eliminated the risk to other aircraft, and within a geographical
envelope under the sole control of myself. Accordingly, the risk would be limited to
myself, as I will be appropriately outfitted in safety gear, and my property on the
ground. Requiring a commercial pilot certificate would provide no appreciable safety
benefit and would needlessly impose additional cost on myself. Because the
contemplated operations would not comply with §61.113(b)(1) and none of the
other exceptions to paragraph (a) apply, relief is needed from both paragraphs (a)
and (b).
14 C.F.R. 91.11 9(c)

           §91.119 Minimum safe altitudes: General.

           Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an
         aircraft below the following altitudes:

          ***

         (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the
         surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases,
         the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to an person, vessel,
         vehicle, or structure

          ****

           I submit that the only relief it requires from §91 .11 9 is from the minimum
altitudes listed in paragraph (c). Relief is required from paragraph (c) for fixed wing
operations because asset evaluation conducted at 500 feet or higher is insufficiently
distinct to be meaningful. Since operations at this altitude also pose a heightened
risk of collision with another aircraft, safety can only be assured through a grant of
an exemption. The anticipated rotorcraft operations should be adequately
addressed by paragraph (d)(1 ). Additionally, relief should not be needed from
paragraph (a) because an emergency landing of the aircraft due to power failure will
not create an undue hazard to persons or property on the surface. As noted in the
depletion of why an exemption will not adversely affect safety, I have exclusive use
of the land over with the sUAS will be operated, and public access is usually
restricted. It also has exclusive use of significant portions of land adjacent to the
infrastructure and structures that will be objects of evaluation and analysis. My
clients will tightly unreal access to land and have the ability to assure that no
individuals unassisted with the planned operations are on the affected land. As
such, the risk of injury is minimal. I do not contemplate conduction operations over
congested areas, so relief is not request from paragraph (b).
14 C.F.R. 91.121

          14 C.F.R § 91.121 Altimeter Settings

           This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain
         cruising altitude by reference to an altimeter that is set" ...to the elevation of
         the departure airport or an appropriate altimeter setting available before
         departure."

         *****

           As the sUAS may not be a barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude
read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be
achieved by the operator, pursuant to the Manual and Safety Check list, confirming
the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

Altitude information will be provided to the sUAS pilot via a digitally encoded
telemetric data fee,d which downlinks from the aircraft to a ground-based on-screen
display, This altitude information will be generated by equipment installed on board
the aircraft, using GPS triangulation, or digitally encoded barometric altimeter, or
radio altimeter, or any combination thereof. Prior to each flight a zero altitude
initiation point will be established and confirmed for accuracy by the pilot.

14C.F.R. 91.151

            Operating the sUAS in a pre-defined area with less than 30 minutes of
reserve fuel does not raise the type of risk contemplated by §91 .151, i.e., that an
aircraft could run out of fuel in the event that it has to be flown to an alternate airport
or circle that planned airport in the event of unanticipated conditions. I do not
indeed to use the sUAS for point-to-point flights and will not operate the sUAS
beyond visual line of sight. Nor will the sUA require an airport in order to land.
Rather, I will operate the sUAS will be pre-planned flight paths (taking into account
weather conditions) designed to allow the sUAS to fly to the point of intended
landing. As such, there is no need for a time-based excess fuel requirement. Rather
it should be sufficient to require only as much additional excess flight capacity as
necessary to safely land the sUAS. I believe that a 25% battery reserve is more than
sufficient to meet the objective.

           Each owner or operator of an aircraft -

          (a) Shall have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part
         and shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c)
         of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this

         §91.407 Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance,
         rebuilding, or alteration.

     (a) No person may operate any aircraft that has undergone maintenance,
           rebuilding or alteration unless -

(1) It has been approved for return to service by a person authorized under 43.7 of
     this chapter

§91.409 Inspections

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person may operate an
aircraft unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months it has had _

(1) An annual inspection in accordance with part 43 of this chapter and has been
     approved for return to service by a person authorized by §43. 7 of this chapter;
     or

(2) An inspection for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with
      part 21 of this chapter.

*****

§91.417 (a}&(b}

*****
           I believe that an exemption form these three maintenance requirements i
approbate because the FAA has not developed maintenance standards that would
allow an operator to meet the part 91 maintenance requirements. In particular, there
are no individuals authorized by the FAA to approve a sUAS for return to service
inspections required by §91.409(a) or conduct the initial airworthiness and annual
return to service inspections required by §91.409(a). I will maintain the aircraft as
instructed in the owner's manual and ASTM F2909, where applicable, and will not
operate the aircraft until it has reasonably determined that any needed repairs have
been made. However, because of the technical impossibility of meeting the
requirements of §§91.405(a), 407(a), 409(a) and 417(a)&(b), I believe an exemption
from these provisions is appropriate.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at the phone number or via the e-mail address
provided above should you have any questions or concerns.

           Respectfully submitted,

           Neil B. Sulish

Description of Relief Sought:

Petitioner seeks relief form the requirements of 333 Aircraft Exemptions Status, 14
C.F.R., 61.113(a)&(b)), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151, 91.405(a), 91.407(a), 91.409(a)
and 91.417(a)&(b) to conduct sUAS operations over my client's one or controlled
land, solely during daylight hours, to assist in the safe evaluation and analysis of
operations. In general, sUAS operations are intended to be conducted in remote
areas remote from both congested areas and airports. The nature of operations
anticipated by myself required that the sUAS be flown at relatively low altitudes. I
expect that in most instances, the sUAS will be flown less than 75 feet from the
highest structure along the path of the sUAS and in no instances will be flown higher
than 400 feet above the ground. Accordingly, the risk of interference with other
aircraft is minimal.

Product Profile

The Phantom 3 Professional represents the next generation of DJI quadcopters. It is capable of capturing
4K video and transmitting an HD video signal out of the box. The built-in camera has an integrated gimbal
to maximize stability while minimizing both weight and size. Even when no GPS signal is available, the
Vision Positioning System allows the aircraft to hover accurately in place.

Camera and Gimbal: With the Phantom 3 Professional, you're shooting 4K video at up to 30 frames per
second and capturing 12 megapixel photos that look crisper and cleaner than ever. An enhanced sensor
gives you greater clarity, lower noise, and better pictures than any previous flying camera.

HD Video Downlink: The low-latency long range HD downlink is powered by an enhanced version of DJI
Lightbridge.

DJI Intelligent Flight Battery: The 4480 mAh DJI Intelligent Flight Battery features upgraded battery cells
and an advanced power management system.

Flight Controller: The next-generation flight controller has been updated to provide a safer, more reliable
flight experience. A newly implemented flight recorder stores critical data from each flight and the Vision
Positioning System enhances hovering precision when flying indoors or in environments where GPS is
unavailable.

The Phantom 3 Professional's flight controller features several important upgrades, including a new flight
mode. Safety modes include Failsafe and Return-to-Home. These features ensure the safe return of your
aircraft if the control signal is lost. The flight controller can also save critical flight data from each flight
to the on-board storage device. The new flight controller also provides increased stability and a new air
braking feature.

Three flight modes are available. The details of each flight mode are found below:                                                                ?.

     P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both are available. The aircraft is using GPS for positioning.
     P-OPTI: Vision Positioning is available but the GPS signal strength is not sufficient. The aircraft is

               using only the Vision Positioning System for positioning.
     P-ATII: Neither GPS nor Vision Positioning is available. The aircraft is using only its barometer for

                positioning, so only altitude can be stabilized.
A-mode (Attitude): GPS and Vision Positioning System are not used for stabilization. The aircraft only uses
its barometer. The aircraft can still automatically return to the home point if the control signal is lost and
the Home Point was recorded successfully.
F-mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this mode. For more information
about IOC, refer to the IOC section in the Appendix.

The Return-to-Home (RTH) function brings the aircraft back to the last recorded Home Point There are
three types of RTH procedures: Smart RTH, Low Battery RTH, and Failsafe RTH. This section describes
these three scenarios in detaiL

Home Point                          If a strong GPS signal was acquired before takeoff, the Horne Point

                                    is the location from which the aircraft was launched. The GPS signal

                                    strength is indicated by the GPS icon ( ~.nll ). The aircraft status

                                    indicator will blink rapidly when the home point is recorded.

Use the RTH button on the remote controller (refer to "RTH button" on page 26 for more information) or
tap the RTH button in the DJI Pilot app and follow the on-screen instructions when GPS is available to ini-
tiate Smart RTH. The aircraft will then automatically return to the last recorded Home Point You may use
the remote controller's control sticks to control the aircraft's position to avoid a collision during the Smart
RTH process. Press and hold the Smart RTH button once to start the process, and press the Smart RTH
button again to terminate the procedure and regain full control of the aircraft.

The low battery level failsafe is triggered when the DJI Intelligent Right Battery is depleted to a point that
may affect the safe return of the aircraft. Users are advised to return home or land the aircraft immediately
when prompted. The DJI Pilot app will display a notice when a low battery warning is triggered. The
aircraft will automatically return to the Home Point if no action is taken after a ten-second countdown. The
user can cancel the RTH procedure by pressing the RTH button on the remote controller. The thresholds
for these warnings are automatically determined based on the aircraft's current altitude and distance from
the Home Point.

The aircraft will land automatically if the current battery level can only support the aircraft long enough
to descend from its current altitude. The user can still use the remote controller to alter the aircraft's
orientation during the landing process.

The Battery Level Indicator is displayed in the DJI Pilot app, and is described below:

The,DJI Vision Positioning System uses ultrasound and image data to help the aircraft maintain its current
position. With the help of Vision Positioning, your Phantom 3 Professional can hover in place more precisely
and fly indoors or in other environments where a GPS signal is not available. The main components of the
Vision Positioning System are located on the bottom of your Phantom 3 Professional; they include [2] two
ultrasonic sensors and [1] one monocular camera.
                                                                                      Phantom 3 Professional User Manual

Using Vision Positioning
Vision Positioning is activated automatically when the Phantom 3 Professional is turned on. No
further action is required. Vision Positioning is typically used in indoor environments, where GPS
is unavailable. Using the sensors that are built into the Vision Positioning system, the Phantom 3
Professional can hover precisely even without GPS.

.Follow the steps below to use Vision Positioning:  ·                                        ·et P

1. Toggle the flight mode switch to P-mode. .       .                                          '· ·

2. Place the aircraft on a flat surface. Note that the·Vision :Positioning system cannot work

properly on surfaces without clear pattern variations.

3. Turn on the aircraft. The aircraft status indicator.will flash green two times, which indicates the Vision

Positioning system is ready. Gently push .the throttle up to lift off and the aircraft will hover in place.

Lb. The performance of your Vision Positioning System is affected by the surface over which it is

       flying. The ufirasonic sensors may not be able to accurately measure distances when operating
       above sound-absorbing materials.' In addition, the camera may not function correctly in
       suboptimal environments. The aircraft will switch from P-mode to A-mode automatically if neither
       GPS nor Vision Positioning System are available. Operate the aircraft with great caution in the
       following situations:
       · Flying over monochrome surfaces (e.g. pure black, pure White, pure· red, pure green).
       · Flying over a highly reflective surfaces.
       · Flying at high speeds(over 8 m/s at 2 meters or over 4 m/s at 1 meter).
       · Flying over water or transparent surfaces.
       · Flying over moving surfaces or objects. ·
      . · Flying in an area where the lighting changes frequently or drastically.
       · Flying over extremely dark (lux< 10) or bright (lux> 100,000) surfaces.
       · Flying over surfaces that can absorb sound waves (e.g. thick carpet).
       · Flying over surfaces without clear pattems oF texture.
       · Flying over surfaces with identical repeating patterns or textures (e.g. tiles with the same design).
       · Flying over inclined surfaces that will deflect sound wavesaway from the aircraft.

:.(J: · Keep the: sensors clean at all times. Dirt or other debris may adversely affect the effectiveness

         of the sensors. .
       · Vision Positioning is only effective when the aircraft is at altitudes of 0.3 to 3 meters.
       · The Vision Positioning System may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water.
       · The Vision Positioning System may not be able to recognize pattern on the ground in low light

          conditions (less than 100 lux).
       · Do not use other ultrasonic devices with frequency of 40 KHz when Vision Positioning system is

          in operation.
       · Vision Positioning System may not be able to stabilize the aircraft when flying close to the

          ground (below 0.5 meters) at fast speeds..

practices and flight restrictions.
    Flight

        Once pre-flight preparation is complete, it is recommended that you use the flight simulator in the OJI Pilot
        app to hone your flight skills and practice flying safely. Ensure that all flights are carried out in an open
        area.

        1. Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speeds exceeding 10 m/s,
           snow, rain and fog.

        2. Only fly in open areas. Tall structures and large metal structures may affect the accuracy of the on-
           board compass and GPS system.

        3. Avoid obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees, and bodies of water.
        4. Minimize interference by avoiding areas with high levels of electromagnetism, including base stations

           and radio transmission towers.
        5. Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

            temperature.Be very careful when flying at altitudes greater than 19, 685 feet (6000 meters) above sea
JJ level, as the performance of the battery and aircraft may be affected.

<;:D:;.: 6. The Phantom 3 Professional cannot operate within the polar areas.

        All unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators should abide by all regulations set forth by government and
        regulatory agencies including the ICAO and the FAA. For safety reasons, flights are limited by default,
        which helps users operate this product safely and legally. Flight limitations include height limits, distance
        limits, and No-Fly Zones.
        When operating in P-mode, height limits, distance limits, and No-Fly Zones function concurrently to
        manage flight safety. In A-mode, only height limits are in effect, which by default prevent the aircraft
        altitude from exceeding 1640 feet (500 m) .

       Maximum flight altitude & Radius Limits
        Maximum flight altitude and radius limits may be changed in the DJI Pilot app. Be aware that the
        maximum flight altitude cannot exceed 1640 feet (500 meters). In accordance with these settings, your

      How do I use the Director automatic video editor?
      Director is an automatic video editor built into the DJI Pilot app. After recording several video clips, simply
      tap "Director" from the app's home screen. You can then select a template and a specified number of
      clips, which are automatically combined to create a short film that can be shared immediately.

      How do I change the control mode of my Phantom 3?
      By default, the Remote Controller is set to Mode 2. This means that the right control stick controls the
      movement of the aircraft and the left control stick controls the throttle and orientation of the aircraft. These
      controls can be changed to Mode 1 or set to a customized configuration in the DJI Pilot app. This is only
      recommended for advanced users.

      Can I use a Phantom 2 Remote Controller with the Phantom 3?
      No. The Phantom 2 Remote Controller operates on a different frequency. The Phantom 2 Remote Controller
      operates at 5.8 GHz and the new Phantom 3 Remote Controller operates at 2.4 GHz.

      Can I use a Phantom 2 Intelligent Flight Battery with the Phantom 3?

""Tl  No. The Phantom 3 uses a newly designed Intelligent Flight Battery with greater power. The Phantom 3 has
)>

0
        a 4 cell battery with a capacity of 4480 mAh and a voltage of 15.2 V.

      My Phantom 3 does not turn off right away, is something wrong?
      This is normal. After you attempt to power off the Intelligent Flight Battery, it may remain on for a few
      seconds as any video data is saved to the Micro SD card. This helps prevent your data from being lost or
      corrupted.

      Do I have to buy the Remote Controller separately?
      No, there is no need to buy a separate Remote Controller. Your Phantom 3 comes with a Remote Controller
      that is already linked to the aircraft.

      Does my Phantom 3 support dual Remote Controllers?
      No. The included Remote Controller can be used to control both the aircraft and the gimbal tilt at the same
      time.

      What does the "P, A, F" switch on the Remote Controller do?
      This switch, called the Flight Mode Switch, allows you to toggle different flight modes:
      P-mode, or Positioning mode, indicates that both GPS and the Vision Positioning System are active and
      your Phantom 3 will attempt to stabilize using both.
      In A-mode, or Attitude mode, the aircraft does not use GPS or the Vision Positioning System. Only the
      barometer is used for stabilization. The aircraft can still return to the Home Point as long as a sufficient GPS
      signal is available.
      F-mode, or Function mode, activates Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) functionality. Refer to the IOC
      section in the Appendix of the User Manual.
      By default, only P-mode may be used. Refer to your user manual for instructions on unlocking the other
      modes.
Phantom 3 Professional User Manual

What is the Phantom 3 flight time?
Flight times will vary depending on environmental conditions and usage patterns, but the Intelligent Flight
Battery is designed to provide up to 23 minutes of uninterrupted flight time when fully charged.

How can I restore a video file if the power is turned off during recording?
Do not remove the Micro-SO card from the camera. If it has been removed, place it back in the camera.
Turn the Phantom 3 on and wait approximately 30 seconds as the video file is restored.

How can I ensure that my pictures and videos will be synchronized to my iOS album?
You may need to adjust the settings of your mobile device. Open the Settings menu, select the Privacy
tab, select the Photos tab, and then toggle the switch next to the OJI Pilot app icon. If the Pilot app has not
been granted access to your albums, the photos and videos cannot be synchronized.

What should I do to land my Phantom 3 smoothly as possible?                                                            .,
Hover the aircraft over a flat, level surface. Slowly pull the throttle stick down until the aircraft touches the
ground.                                                                                                                )>

Why is the discharge time of the battery not zero, even though I have never used it?                                   0
Every battery is tested prior to being packaged and shipped. This affects the discharge time of a new
battery and is the reason that the discharge time is not zero. The battery is safe to use.

Can the mobile device holder be used on the Phantom 2 series Remote Controller?
No, it cannot.

How to safely operate the aircraft when encountering compass error?
A compass error may occur when the aircraft is flying close to strong electric magnetic sources (e.g.
power transmission lines). Aircraft Status Indicators blink red and yellow rapidly when a compass error
occurs and the OJI Pilot app will display one of the following messages:
· Compass error, calibration required

  This warning message indicates the aircraft is receiving abnormal compass readings. It is recommended
  to power off the aircraft and re-calibrate the compass at a different location and then resume the flight.
· Compass error, exit P-GPS Mode
  This warning message indicates that the aircraft is drifting severely. Bring the aircraft to a higher altitude
  to gain enough GPS satellite locks when this warning message is prompted. The flight controller will
  automatically adjust the orientation of the aircraft in the midair to mitigate the drifts. The aircraft will switch
  back to P-GPS mode when the automatic adjustment is completed.

IOC allows users to lock the control orientation of the aircraft in different modes. There are three working
modes for IOC that can be selected in the DJI Pilot app. IOC only works when the aircraft is in F-mode,
therefore the user must toggle the flight mode switch to activate IOC. Refer to the table below:

Course Lock (CL)  The nose direction, at the time that CL is set, will remain the forward direction
                  regardless of how the orientation and position of the aircraft changes. This will
                  remain fixed until you reset it or exit CL mode.

Home Lock (HL)*   Record a Home Point (HP) and enter HL mode. The forward and backward
                  controls will move the aircraft farther from and closer to the established Home
                  Pont, regardless of how the orientation and position of the aircraft changes.

                               Point of Interest Record a point of interest (POl). The aircraft can then circle
Point of Interest (POl)* around the POl and the nose will always points toward the POL

The Inspire 1's flight controller is based on DJI flight controller with several enhancements such as new
flight mode and new safe mode. Three safe modes are available: Failsafe, Return Home and Dynamic
Home Point. These features ensure the safe return of your aircraft if the control signal is lost. A flight
recorder stores crucial flight data for each flight.

Three flight modes are available. The details of each flight mode are found in the section below:
P mode (Positioning) : P mode works best when GPS signal is strong. There are three different states of P
mode, which will be automatically selected by the Inspire 1 depending on GPS signal strenglh and Vision
Positioning sensors:

     P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning bolh are available, and tl1e aircraft is using GPS for positioning.
     P-OPTI: Vision Positioning is available but the GPS signal is not. Aircraft is using only Vision
     Positioning for hovering
     P-ATTl: Neither GPS or Vision Positioning available, aircraft is using only its barometer for positioning,
     so only altitude is controlled.
A mode (Attitude): The GPS and Vision Positioning System is not used for holding position. The aircraft
only uses its barometer to maintain altitude. If it is still receiving a GPS signal, the aircraft can automatically
return horne if !he Remote Controller signal is lost and if tl1e Horne Point has been recorded successfully.
F mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in !his mode. For more information
about IOC, refer to !he IOC in Appendix.

 :\J~ Use the Flight Controller mode switch to change the flight mode of the aircraft, refer to the "Flight
          Mode SWitch" on P27 for more information.

The INSPIRE 1 comes wilh the Front LED, Rear LED and Aircraft Status Indicator. The positions of lhese
LEOs are shown in the figure below:

The Front and Rear LED show !he orientation of !he aircraft. The Front LED displays solid red and the
Rear LED displays solid green.
Aircraft Status Indicator shows the system status of the flight controller. Refer to the table below for more

The Return to Home (RTH) brings the aircraft back to the last recorded Home Point There are three oases
that will trigger RTH procedure; they are Smart RTH, Low Battery RTH and Failsafe RTH.

Horne Point                              The Home Point is lhe location at which your aircraft takes off when the
                                         GPS signal is strong. You can view the GPS signal strength through

                                         the GPS icon ( ~.u:~ ). If you are using the Dynamic Home Point

                                         setting, the Home Point will be updated to your current position as you
                                         move around and when the Aircraft Status Indicator blinks green.

Smart RTH

Using the RTH button on the remote controller (refer to "RTH button· on P28 for more information) or the
RTH button in the DJI Pilot app when GPS is available to enables smart RTH. The aircraft return to the
latest recorded Home Point. you may control the aircraft's orientation to avoid collision during the Smart
RTH. Press the Smart RTH button once to stert the process, press the Smart RTH button again to exit
Smart RTH and regain the control.

Low Battery RTH
The low battery level failsafe is triggered when the OJI Intelligent Flight Battery is depleted to a point that
may affect the safe return of the aircraft. Users are advised to return horne or land the aircraft immediately
when these warnings are shown. DJI Pilot app will advise user to return the aircraft to the Home Point
when low battery warning is triggered. Aircraft will automatically return to the Home Point if no action is
taken after 10 seconds countdown. User can cancel the RTH by pressing once on the RTH button. The
thresholds for these warnings are automatically determined based on the current aircraft altitude and its
distance from the Home Point.
Aircraft will land automatically if the current battery level can only support the aircraft to land to the ground
from 1he current altitude. User can use the remote controller to control the aircraft's orientation during the
landing process.

The Battery Level indicator is displayed in 1he DJI Pilot app, and is described below

          automatically, you may push the throttle upward to hover the aircraft and navigate it to a more
          appropriate location for landing.

        · Color zones and markers on the battery level indicator reflect estimated remaining flight time
          and are adjusted automatically, according to the aircraft's current status.

Failsafe RTH

Failsafe RTH is activated automatically if remote controller signal (including videc relay signal) is lost for
more than 3 seconds provided that Horne Point has been successfully recorded and compass is working
normally. Return home process may be interrupted and the operator can regain control over the aircraft if
a remote controller signal is resumed.

~ · Aircraft automatically descends and lands if RTH is triggered when the aircraft flies within a 20
          meter (65 feet) radius of the Home Point.

        · Aircraft cannot avoid obstruction during the Failsafe RTH, therefore it is important to set an
          reasonable Failsafe altitude before each flight. Launch the DJI Pilot app and enter "Camera"
          view and select "MODE" to set the Failsafe altitude.

        · Aircraft will stop ascending and immediately return to the Home Point if you move the throttle
          stick if the aircraft reaches 20m altitudes or beyond during Failsafe.

Dynamic home point is useful in situations when you are in
motion and require a Home Point that is different from the
takeoff point. GPS module is located at the position shown in
the figure below:

        DJI Vision Positioning is a positioning system that uses ultrasonic and image data to help the aircraft
        identify its current position. With the help of Vision Positioning, your Inspire 1 can hover in place more
        precisely and fly indoors or in other environments where there is no GPS signal available. The main
       components of DJI Vision Positioning are located on the bottom of your Inspire 1, including [1 ]two sonar
        sensors and[2]one monocular camera.

                                           l

Using Vision Positioning
Vision Positioning is activated automatically when the Inspire 1 is powered on. No manual action is
required. Vision Positioning is typically used in the indoor environment where no GPS is available. By
using the sensors on the Vision Positioning system, Inspire 1 can perform precision hovering even when
no GPS is available.

Follow the steps below to use Vision Positioning:
1. Toggle the switch to ·p· as shown the figure to the right:
2. Place the Inspire 1 on a flat surface. Notice that the Vision Positioning system

    cannot work properly on surfaces without pattern variations.
3. Power on the Inspire 1. The aircraft status indicator will flash twice in green light,

   which indicates the Vision Positioning system is ready. Gently push tha throttle up
    to lift off, and tha Inspire 1 will hcver in place.

 Lb, The performance ot your Inspire 1's Vision Positioning System is subject to the surface you are

         flying over. The ultrasonic waves may not be able to accurately measure the distance over sound
          absorbing materials, and the camera may not function correctly in suboptimal environments. The
          aircraft will switch from ·p· mode to "A" mode automatically if both GPS and Vision Positioning
         System are not available. So operate the aircraft cautiously when in any of the following situations:
          · Flying over monochrome surfaces (e.g. pure black, pure white, pure red, pure green).
          · Flying over a highly reflective surfaces.
          · Flying at high speeds(over 8m/s at 2 meters or over 4m/s at 1 meter).
          · Flying over water or transparent surfaces.
          · Flying over moving surfaces or objects.
          · Flying in an area where the lighting changes frequently or drastically.
          · Flying over extremely dark (lux< 10) or bright (lux> 10,000) surfaces.
          · Flying over surfaces that can absorb sound waves (e.g. thick carpet).
          · Flying over surfaces without clear patterns or texture.
          · Flying over surfaces with identical repeating patterns or textures (e.g. tiles with same design).
          · Flying over inclined surfaces that will deflect sound waves away from the aircraft.
          · In the event of loss of remote controller's signal, the aircraft will hover for 8 seconds and then

            auto-land if it is in "P" mode.

 :\): · Keep the sensors clean at all times. Dirt or other debris may adversely affect the effectiveness
            of the sensors.

          · The effective hovering altitudes of the aircraft is from 0 to 2.5 meters.
          · Vision Positioning system may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water.
          · Vision Positioning system may not be able to recognize pattern on the ground in low light

            conditions (less than 1001ux).
          · Do not use other ultrasonic devices with frequency of 40 KHz when Vision Positioning system is

            in operation.
          · Vision Positioning system may not be able to stabilize the aircraft when flying close to the

            ground (below 0.5 meters) in fast speed.

 0 Keep the animals away from the aircraft when Vision PosHioning system is activated. The sonar

          sensor emits high frequency sound that is only audible to some animals.

Flight data is automatically stored in the internal storage device of the aircraft. User can gain access to
these data through the DJI Pilot app. This includes flight duration, orientation, distance, aircraft status
information, speed, and other parameters.

Use only DJI approved propellers with your Inspire 1. The grey or black nut on the propeller indicates
the rotation direction of the propeller and where it should be attached. To attach the propellers properly,

      Low Temperature Notice:

        1. The performance of the intelligent Flight Battery is significantly reduced when flying in a low
          temperature environments (those with air temperatures below S°C). Ensure that the battery is fully
           charged and the cell voltage is at 4.43 V before each flight.

       2. Using the Intelligent Flight Battery in extremely low temperature environments (those with air
          temperatures below -10°C) is not recommended. When flying in environments with temperatures

       socbetween and -1 0°C, the Intelligent Flight Battery should be able to achieve the appropriate voltage

           levels (above 4.2 V), but it is recommended that you apply the included insulation sticker to the battery
            in order to prevent a rapid drop in temperatures.
       3. If the DJI Pilot app displays the "Critical Low Battery Level Warning" when flying in low temperature
)> environments, stop flying and land the aircraft immediately. You will still be able to control the aircraft's
~- movement when this warning is triggered.

~ 4. Store the Intelligent Flight Battery in a room temperature environment and ensure that its temperature
       socexceeds before using it in the low temperature environment.

      S. When using the Inspire 1 in a low temperature environment, begin by allowing the aircraft to hover at a
            low altitude, for approximately one minute, to heat the battery.

      6. To ensure optimum performance, keep the Intelligent Flight Battery's core temperature above 20°C
            when in use.

     Lt. In cold environments, insert the battery into the battery compartment and allow the aircraft to

               warm up for approximately 1-2 minutes before taking off.

-:.IJ: How to discharge your Intelligent Flight Battery:

        To effectively calibrate the battery capacity, it is recommended to charge and discharge the
        battery thoroughly for every 10 charge-and-discharge cycle. User should install the battery onto
        the aircraft and then power on the aircraft to initiate the discharge process, discharge the battery
        until the aircraft is powered off automatically. User should then fully charge the battery to ensure
        the battery is working at its optimal.
        Slow: Place the Intelligent Flight Battery into the Inspire 1's Battery Compartment and power it

                 on. Leave it on until there is less than 5% of power left, or until the battery can no longer
                 be turned on. Launch the OJ! Pilot app to check battery level.
        Rapid: Fly the Inspire 1 outdoors until there is less than 5% of power left, or until the battery can
                  no longer be turned on.

Gimbal Operation Modes

Three Gimbal operation modes are available. Switch between the different operation modes on the
Camera page of the DJI Pilot App. Note that your mobile device must be connected to the remote
controller for changes to take effect Refer to the table below for details:

Pitch                              Pan

Follow Mode                        The angle between Gimbal's orientation and aircraft's nose remains
                                   constant at all times. One user alone can control the pitch motion of the
                                   Gimbal, but a second user is required to control the pan motion us·lng a
                                   second remote controller.

FPVMode                            The Gimbal will lock to the movements of the aircraft to provide a First-
                                   Person-View flying experience.

Free Mode                          The Gimbal's motion is independent of the aircraft's orientation. One user
                                   alone can control the pitch motion of the Gimbal, but a second user is
                                   required to control the pan motion us·lng a second remote controller.

Re-alignment                       Tap to force the Gimbal orientation to re-align with aircraft's orientation
                                   by panning from gimbal's current orientation. Pitch angle will remain
                                   unchanged during the re-alignment

Lt:, · Gimbal motor error may occur in these situations: (1) Gimbal is placed on uneven ground. (2)

          Gimbal has received an excessive external force, e.g. a collision. Please take off from flat, open
          ground and protect the gimbal after powering up .
        · Flying in heavy fog or cloud may make the gimbal wet, leading to a temporary failure. The
          gimbal will recover when it dries out

Once pre-ffight preparation is complete, it is recommended to use the flight simulator to learn how to fly
safely. Ensure that all flights are carried out in a suitable location.

1. Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speed exceeding 1Om/s ,
    snow, rain and smog.

2. Only fly in open areas. Tall buildings and steel structures may affect the accuracy of the on-board
    compass and GPS signal.

3. Avoid from obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees or bodies of water.
4. Minimize electromagnetic interference by not flying in area with high levels of electromagnetism,

    including mobile phone base stations or radio transmission towers.
5. Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environment factor such as air density and temperature.

    Be very careful when flying 14700 feet (4500 meters) or more above sea level as battery and aircraft
   performance may be reduced.
6. The Inspire 1 cannot operate within the polar areas in "P" mode.

Flight limits on height and distance can be set. The details of these fight limits are described in the following
section.
All unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations as
the lCAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), FAA and their own national airspace regulations. For
safety reasons, the flight limits function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and
legally. The flight limits function includes height limits. distance limits and No Fly Zones.
When operating in P Mode, height, distance limits and No Fly Zones work together to manage flight. In A
mode only height limits work and flights cannot go higher than 120 meters.

Max Height & Radius Limits

Max Height & Radius limit flying height and distance, and the user may change these settings in the
OJI Pilot App. Once complete, your Inspire 1 will fly in a restricted cylinder that is determined by these
settings. The tables below show the details of these limits.

       ,& · If you fly out of the limit, you can still control the Inspire 1, but cannot fly it further.

                   · If the Inspire 1 flies out of the max radius in Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode, it will fly back within
                     range automatically.

        No-Fly Zones
        All No-Fly Zones are listed on the DJI official website at http://flysafe.dji.com/no-fly. No-Fly Zones are
        divided into Airports and Restricted Areas. Airports include major airports and flying fields where manned
        aircraft operate at low altitudes. Restricted Areas include borders between countries or sensitive sites.
        The details of the No-Fly Zones are explained below:

        Airport:
        (1) Airport No-Fly Zones are comprised of Takeoff Restricted Zones and Restricted-Altitude Zones. Each

              zone features circles of various size.
        (2) R1 depends on the size and shape of the airport, and is an area around the airport that is a Takeoff

             Restricted Zone, inside of which take-off and fight is prevented.

       (3) From R1 to R1 +1 mile around the airport, the flight altitude is limited on a 15 degree incline, starting at

              65 feet (20 meters) from the edge of airport and radiating outward. The flight altitude is limited to 1640
              feet (500 meters) at R1+1 mile.
        (4) When the aircraft is within 320 feet (100 meters) of the No-Fly Zones, a warning message will appear
              in the OJI Pilot app.

Restricted Areas:

(1) Restricted Areas do not have a flight altitude restriction.
(2) R around the designated Restricted Area is a Take-off Restricted area. Aircraft cannot takeoff within

     this zone. The value of R varies depending on the definition of the Restricted Area.
(3) A "warning zone" has been set around each Restricted Area When the aircraft is within 0.6 miles (1

     km) of this zone, a warning message will appear in the DJI Pilot app.

Follow the process described below to upgrade the aircraft, remote controller and battery.

Updating the Aircraft Firmware
Step 1- Check Battery and SD Card Capacity
Ensure the Intelligent Flight Battery has at least 50% power and there is at least 100MB of free space on
theSDcard.

Step 2- Prepare the Firmware Update Package
1. Download the firmware update package from the official DJI website (http:/{www.dji.com/product/

    inspire-1 ).
2. Insert the SO into your PC. Extract the all downloaded files into the root directory of the SO card.

   Remove the SO card from your PC. Ensure the Inspire 1 is powered off then insert the SO card into the
    SO card slot on the Inspire 1 camera.

Step 3- Update the Aircraft
1. Ensure the remote controller is powered off and then power on the aircraft. Upgrade will begin

    automatically after aircraft is powered on.
2. It will take approximately 25 minutes to complete the firmware update. The camera will sound a short

    pulse of 'D-D-D-0' beeping sound to indicate the upgrade is in progress and sound a "D---DD"
    beeping sound to indicate the update is complete with success.
3. Check the upgrade status by opening the ·.txt" file that is automatically generated after the update.
    The update is successful if the text "result: successful" is in the document. Try upgrading the firmware
    again if the text ·result failed" is found or the gimbal sound a long beep sound.

Updating the Remote Controller Firmware
Step 1- Check Battery and SD Card Capacity
Remote controller firmware is included in the aircraft firmware update package. Use the same update
package file that is downloaded from the DJI official website. Ensure the remote controller battery level is
above 50%.

Step 2- Prepare the Firmware Update Package
1. Extract all downloaded files into the root directory of an SD card or USB thumb drive.
2. Insert the SO card into a SD card reader or the USB disk onto the remote controller USB port when

    remote controller powered off. If you do not have a SD card reader, you may insert the SD card into
    the gimbal and connect the gimbal with remote controller to upgrade the remote controller.

Step 3- Update the Remote Controller
1. Power on the remote controller and wait 60 seconds until the upgrade begins. Do not power off the

    remote controller during the update.
2. It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete the firmware update. The camera will sound a

    beeping sound and the Status LED on the remote controller shows solid blue to indicate the update is
    in progress. The Status LED on remote controller shows solid green and beeping sound will stop if the
    upgrade is completed with success. The Status LED on remote controller shows solid red if upgrade is
    failed. Try upgrade again.

                                                                                               © 2015 DJI All R~ghts Reserved 61

Updating Intelligent Flight Battery Finnware

The Intelligent Flight Battery is upgraded during the aircraft firmware upgrade process. It is recommended
to keep the upgrade package files in your SD card. The upgrade will start automatically after power
cycling the aircraft.

 & · Do not perform firmware update while the aircraft is still flying in the air. Only carry out firmware

           update when the aircraft is landed.
         · Be sure to update the remote controller's firmware to the latest version after you upgrade the aircraft's

            firmware.
         · The remote controller may become unlinked from the aircraft after updating. Re-link the remote

            controller and aircraft.
          · Confirm 1he update results according to the gimbal sounds. It is normal for the aircraft to sound or the

            LED to blink during the update process.
          · Ensure there is only one firmware package file stored on your SD card.
          · Only storage devices that are formatted for FAT32 and exFATfile systems are supported for aircraft

            and remote controller firmware updates.
         · Delete any automatically generated 1xt files (xxx_GS.TXT) in the SD card when updating multiple

             remote controllers.
