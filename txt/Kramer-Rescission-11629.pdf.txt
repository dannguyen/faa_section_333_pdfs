                                   RESCISSION OF EXEMPTION

   On May 20, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Mr. John C. Kramer
Exemption No.11629. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14
CFR), allows Mr. John C. Kramer to conduct aerial photography with a small unmanned
aircraft system (sUAS). After reviewing this exemption, the FAA is rescinding Exemption
No. 11629.

On March 9, 2015, Mr. Kramer submitted a petition for exemption to allow commercial
operations of unmanned aircraft. Mr. Robert Serino was identified in the petition as the point
of contact. On May 20, 2015 the FAA granted the exemption to Mr. Kramer and emailed its
decision to Mr. Serino at the email address provided in the contact information section of the
petition. Mr. Serino replied to that email stating that he has neither "knowledge nor affiliation
with John C. Kramer and made no submission to the FAA in this regard."

AFS-15-3864-E
                                                                                                                  2
A review of Mr. Kramer's petition shows that Mr. Kramer submitted, verbatim, the petition
submitted by Mr. Serino on February 19, 2015, 1 including the page with Mr. Serino's
signature as the submitter of the petition. Mr. Kramer substituted his name for Mr. Serino's in
only a few places.
The FAA granted the exemption to Mr. Kramer based on the record he submitted which
included Mr. Serino's mailing address and signature. The FAA learned after granting the
exemption that Mr. Serino was not affiliated with Mr. Kramer or the petition. Accordingly,
we have determined that the exemption was granted based on erroneous information provided
by the petitioner, including an incorrect mailing address, providing sufficient basis to rescind
Exemption No. 11629.
The FAA's Decision:

   In consideration of the foregoing, I find that Exemption No. 11629 was issued based on
erroneous information submitted by petitioner and was therefore granted in error. Therefore,
pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. §§ 106(f), 40113 and 44701, delegated to me
by the Administrator, Exemption No. 11629 is rescinded effective immediately.
Issued in Washington, D.C., on August 28, 2015.
