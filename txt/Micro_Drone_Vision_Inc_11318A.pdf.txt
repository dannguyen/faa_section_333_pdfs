                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-1057

Dear Ms. Edwards:

This letter is to inform you that we amended Exemption No. 11318. It explains the basis for
our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions and
limitations.

The Basis for Our Decision

On April 22, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Exemption No. 11318
to Micro Drone Vision, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for relief from §§ 61.23(a) and
(c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR). That exmpetion allows the petitioner to perform aerial data
collection and closed set motion picture and filming with the DJI Phantom 1, the DJI Phantom
2, 550S Flame Wheels, Inspire 1, and S1000.

In that exemption, the FAA was unable to approve all of the requested aircraft until a further
assessment was completed. The FAA is now prepared to act on the petitioner's request for
the remaining aircraft.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the 3D Robotics Iris+, Apprentice, and Penguin B.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11318
remains valid with respect to this exemption and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the
authority provided by 49 U.S.C. §§ 106(f), 40113, and 44701, which the FAA Administrator
has delegated to me, Micro Drone Vision, Inc. is granted an amendment to its exemption that
adds three aircraft: 3D Robotics Iris+, Apprentice, and Penguin B.

The operator shall add this amendment to the original Exemption No. 11318.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11318 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft, and is
amended as follows.

In this grant of exemption, Micro Drone Vision, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the the DJI Phantom 1,
         DJI Phantom 2, 550S Flame Wheels, Inspire 1, S1000, 3D Robotics Iris+, Apprentice,
         and Penguin B when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.
                                                                                     3

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.
Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service
