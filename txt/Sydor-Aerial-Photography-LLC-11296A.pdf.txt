Dear Mr. Sydor:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated November 28, 2014, and by amendment request posted to the public docket on
June 16, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on behalf of Sydor
Aerial Photography, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your
current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to add the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                  2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11296
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11296 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision, DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3 when weighing
         less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will
         require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Re: Exemption Request Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Reform 
Act and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from 14 C.F.R. 
61.113(a) & (b) 91.119(c) 91.151(a) 91.405(a) 91.407(a)(1) 
91.409(a)(2)91.417(a) & (b). 

Dear Sir or Madam:  

 

     MSWLF (Municipal Solid Waste Landfills) provide a valuable 
resource to the community in which they serve. However, it is also an 
inherently hazardous environment. During normal landfill operations 
workers are exposed to potentially hazardous contaminants such as 
methane, dust, bacteria, bioaerosa, coliforms, fecal streptococci, 
carbon dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, microorganisms, and 
fungal spores, as well as various volatile organic compounds not 
listed. 

     MSWLF (Municipal Solid Waste Landfills) is a dynamic ever 
changing environment. Heavy equipment operators and other MSWLF 
employees are at risk for bodily injury due to unforeseen terrain 
changes due to the mass movement of waste. 

     Regularly scheduled aerial surveys / inspections can assist the 
MSWLF operator in tracking compaction rates and remaining void 
space. Aerial surveys / inspections can also be used to provide a 
basis for environmental impact studies, historical pictorial records, and 
accident documentation. 

     The premature closure, or operational suspension of a MSWLF has 
a significant impact on local municipalities, cities and states in which 
they operate. Additionally the planning, building and operating a new 
landfill is not inexpensive or an easy task. As the amount of waste 

 
 

accumulates in current landfills, the MSWLF operator must be able to 
maximize the usage of their MSWLF. 

     Current inspection methods include manned aerial and land survey 
operations. The expense of both procedures can be significant. The 
most accurate MSWLF survey / inspection methodology employs the 
use of manned aircraft. Manned aerial surveys / inspections are also 
the most expensive. Land survey operations of MSWLF is less 
accurate and exposes those individuals to the hazards associated with 
MSWLF. 

     Safe flight UAS operations can provide the MSWLF operator an 
economical means of obtaining valuable information that can be used 
to improve safety and efficiency at MSWLF's.  

     By increasing the frequency of MSWLF data sets, MSWLF 
operators can efficiently manage day to day operations. Additionally, 
having updated image maps can aid first responders in case of fire, 
accidents or other situations in which emergency crew members must 
respond. 

 

  

     Sydor Aerial Photography LLC Petitions the Federal Aviation 
Administration to conduct UAS flights over MSWLF's. UAS flights will 
be used to capture aerial photos for the purpose of providing the 
MSWLF operator with orthomosaics (image maps). The image maps 
can in turn be used to compute volume, create 3D models, profile and 
contour lines, and 3D visualizations of MSWLF's.  

     Post flight editing of orthomosaics will ensure that images captured 
are only of the MSWLF operating theatre.   

     Sydor Aerial Photography LLC specializes in the gathering and 
post processing of image maps. Our experience in sUAS operations 
and project completion gives us the expertise to conduct safeflight 

 
 

sUAS operations. Sydor Aerial Photography LLC takes a planned 
tactical approach to data gathering by optimizing and reviewing the 
most efficient flight plan. This knowledge base has come through 
years of piloting, maintaining, and repairing sUAS. 

    Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act 
of 2012 (the "Reform Act") and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Sydor Aerial 
Photography LLC petitions  the FAA to allow safe flight operation of its 
sUAS for the purpose of conducting aerial photography and 
videography of active and closed MSWLF's. Sydor Aerial Photography 
LLC hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation 
Regulations (FARs) to allow commercial operation of its sUASs, so 
long as such operations are conducted within and under the 
conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA in an 
exemption granted under either Section 333 or Section 49 U.S.C. §
44701(f). 

 

 

    Sydor Aerial Photography LLC has set forth conditions that are 
consistent with the equivalent level of safety set forth in Exemption 
11062 and the related exemptions issued to sUAS companies for 
scripted closed set filming for the motion picture and television 
industry. 

 

 

     As described more fully below, the requested exemption would 
permit the operation of small, unmanned and relatively inexpensive 
sUAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is 1) limited, 2) 
predetermined, 3) controlled as to access, and 4) would provide safety 
enhancements to the already safe operations in the fields in which it 
will operate, presently using manned aircraft or ground inspection 
survey teams. The later places personnel at increased risk of bodily 

 
 

injury and airborne  contaminants. Approval of this exemption would 
thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's 
(the FAA Administrator's) responsibilities to "...establish requirements 
for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace 
system." Section 333(c) of the Reform Act. 

 

The name and address of the applicant is:

Regulations from which the exemption is requested: 

14 C.F.R. 61.113(a) & (b) 14 C.F.R. 91.119(c) 
14 C.F.R. 91.151(a) 
14 C.F.R. 91.405(a)14 C.F.R. 407(a)(1) 14 C.F.R. 409(a)(2)  

14 C.F.R. 417(a) & (b) 

    This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill 
Congress' goal in passing Section 333(a) through (c) of the Reform 
Act. This law directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider 
whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the 
national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the rulemaking 
required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this 
determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of 
UASs do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose 
a threat to national security in light of the following: 

  · The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability  

  · Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and   

         populated areas and  

  · Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the  

         operator.  

    Reform Act § 333(b). Lastly, if the Secretary determines that such 
vehicles "may operate safely in the national airspace system, the 
Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such 
aircraft in the national airspace system." Id. at § 333(c) 
 

    The Federal Aviation Act, in addition to the authority granted by 
Section 333 of Reform Act, expressly grants the FAA the authority to 
issue exemptions. This statutory authority by its terms includes 

 
 

exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under Section 40101 of 
the Act, which includes sUASs, from the requirement that all civil 
aircraft must have a current airworthiness certificate. 

    The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a 
regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of Section 333 or any 
Sections 4470244716 of the Transportation Act if the Administrator 
finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. § 44701(f). See 
also 49 U.S.C. § 44711(a) 49 U.S.C. § 44704 14 C.F.R. §
91.203(a)(1). This authority to grant exemptions reaches such issues 
as authorization of commercial operation of aircraft without a pilot's 
license. 

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

    Sydor Aerial Photography LLC is a 100% veteran owned company 
that specializes in the gathering of aerial photos for the purpose of 
rendering survey grade orthomosaics or image maps with small 
UAS's. Based upon the spirit of Section 333, and the continuing 
integration of small UAS's into the NAS, Sydor Aerial Photography 
LLC has limited its petition to inspection and surveying of active and 
closed MSWLF.  

    Sydor Aerial Photography LLC operates a multirotor UAS 
(quadcopter) weighing 1160g with payload. Maximum manufacturer's 
safe flight speed is less than 15m/s. Sydor Aerial Photography LLC 
will not exceed 10m/s during UAS operation. 

    UA will not exceed 400 ft (AGL) and will only be operated within line 
of sight of the PIC and VO. 

    UAS flights will only be performed over MSWLFs and only with 
written permission by the MSWLF operator or governing body 
overseeing the operation and safety of the MSWLF. 

    Sydor Aerial Photography LLC submits "UAS safe flight operations 
manual", as it pertains to MSWLF UAS operations as Exhibit A. 

    Sydor Aerial Photography LLC submits the "UAS manufacturer 
flight and operational manual" as Exhibit B. 

    Operational compliance of Exhibit A and B shall insure safe flight 
operations within the MSWLF theatre. Compliance outlined in Exhibit 
A and B shall also insure safe flight UAS operations within the NAS.  

 

 

     Sydor Aerial Photography LLC proposes to operate a small UAS 
within the sterile confines of active and closed landfills for the purpose 
of creating 2D and 3D orthomosaics or image mapping. The 
completed orthomosaic will be survey grade quality. The ability to 
create accurate aerial survey maps with a UAS does not require the 

 
 

UAS to operate at a height greater than 400 ft (AGL) from the highest 
point of the landfill. Survey grade aerial maps from a UAS are best 
achieved at a height between 100250 ft (AGL) from the highest point 
of the landfill. UAS operations will not be operated outside of the PIC 
(Pilot in Charge) and the VO (visual observer) line of sight.  

     Given the height required for the UAS operation, as it relates to 
inspection and surveying active and closed landfills, and the mostly 
rural environment that MSWLF operate in, Sydor Aerial Photography 
LLC proposes that its UAS operation will have no adverse affect on 
the National Airspace (NAS). 

     Employees at municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLF) must 
comply with OSHA (Occupational Health and Safety Act) standards 
and practices. This includes wearing proper PPE (Personal Protective 
Equipment). PPE includes, but is not limited to hardhats, gloves, 
protective eyewear, reflective vest. Given the sparse population within 
the MSWLF and the current safety regulations, Sydor Aerial 
Photography LLC proposes that UAS operations over MSWLF's 
should be considered "safeflight".   

  

 

     Due to the restricted UAS operating area and nature of MSWLF's, 
damage to property is considered minimal. In the event that personal 
property is damaged by the UAS operation, Sydor Aerial Photography 
LLC will hold insurance coverage that covers any damage that may 
occur. 

 

AIRCRAFT AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY 

Sydor Aerial Photography LLC proposes that the exemption requested 
herein apply to civil aircraft that have the characteristics and that 
operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for 

 
 

an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the 
current regulatory structure because the proposed operations 
represent a safety enhancement to the operations normally conducted 
with manned aircraft. 

These limitations and conditions to which Sydor Aerial Photography 
LLC agrees to be bound when conducting commercial operations 
under an FAA issued exemption include: 

  1. The UAS must weigh less than 25 lbs., including battery and 
       camera. Operations will be limited to the aircraft described in 
       Exhibit B 

  2. The UA may not be flown faster than recommended by the 
       manufacturer. Sydor Aerial Photography LLC will not operate the 
       UA faster than 10m/s. 

  3. UAS operations will be conducted below 400 ft above ground 
       level (AGL). The height of the UA will not exceed 400 ft (AGL). 

   4. The UAS will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the 
       PIC at all times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human 
       vision unaided by any device other than corrective lenses, as 
       specified on the PIC's FAA issued thirdclass medical certificate.  

   5. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The VO may be 
       used to satisfy the VLOS requirement, as long as the PIC always 
       maintains VLOS capability. The VO and PIC must be able to 
       communicate verbally at all times. 

   6. The operator will be bound by and follow Exhibits A & B. Any 
       additional requirements identified in the final conditions for this 
       exemption will be added to Exhibits A & B . Exhibits A & B will be 
       maintained and made available to the Administrator upon 
       request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and 
       limitations in the final exemption and the procedures outlined in 
       Exhibits A & B, the conditions and limitations of the exception will 

 
 

       take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the operator 
       will follow the procedures as outlined in Exhibits A & B.  

   7. The operator will update or revise its Exhibits A & B. It will be the 
       operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present 
       updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon 
       request. The operator will also present updated and revised 
       documents if it petitions for extension or amendment. If the 
       operator determines that any update or revision would affect the 
       basis for which the FAA granted this exemption, then the 
       operator will petition for amendment to their exemption. The 
       operator will contact the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS80) 
       with questions that may arise regarding updates or revisions to 
       Exhibits A & B. 

    8. Prior to each flight the PIC will inspect the UAS to ensure it is in 
       safe flight condition. The procedures for preflight inspection and 
       functional viability of all UAS components is outlined in Exhibit A 
       & B 

    9. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that 
       affect the UAS operation or flight characteristics, e.g., 
       replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo two 
       functional tests outlined in Exhibit C. The PIC who conducts the 
       functional tests will make an entry into the sUAS maintenance 
       record. Specific procedures for the sUAS functional tests is 
       submitted as Exhibit C. 

  10. The operator will comply with the manufacturer's 
       recommendations pertaining to maintenance, inspection and 
       replacement of UAS components. The maintenance manual, 
       submitted as Exhibit C, outlines these components.  

  11. The PIC will have at least a current private pilot certificate and a 
       current thirdclass medical certificate. The PIC will also meet the 

 
 

       flight review requirements specified in 14 C.F.R. § 61.56 in an 
       aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his/her pilot certificate. 

  12. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of gathering aerial 
       data, the PIC will have accumulated and logged, in a manner 
       consistent with 14 C.F.R. § 61.51(b), a minimum of 300 flight 
       cycles and 30  hours of total time as a UAS multirotor aircraft 
       pilot and at least 20 hours logged as a UAS pilot with a similar 
       UAS type. Prior documented flight experience that was obtained 
       in compliance with applicable regulations will be used to satisfy 
       this requirement. Training, proficiency, and experiencebuilding 
       flights may also be conducted under this grant of exemption to 
       accomplish the required flight cycles and flight time. During 
       training, proficiency, and experiencebuilding flights, all persons 
       not essential for flight operations will be considered 
       nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with 
       appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 
       C.F.R. § 91.119.  

  13. Prior to any UAS operations by a grant of exemption the PIC and 
       VO will have completed a qualification process outlined in Exhibit 
       D. Exhibit D includes basic flight maneuvers, skilled flight 
       maneuvers, advanced flight maneuvers, and emergency 
       procedures. The qualifying process outlined in Exhibit D will be 
       implemented by a qualified person designated by the operator. 
       Upon request the record of qualifying completion will be made 
       available to the administrator. 

  14. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of gathering aerial 
       data, a flight demonstration, administered by an 
       operatorapproved and qualified pilot will be successfully 
       completed and documented. This documentation will be 
       available for review upon request by the Administrator. Because 
       the knowledge and airmanship test qualifications will be 
       developed by the operator, and there are no established 
       practical test standards that support a jurisdictional FAA Flight 

 
 

       Standards District Office (FSDO) evaluation and approval of 
       company designated examiners, the Operator will conduct these 
       tests In accordance with Exhibit D. 

 15. The UAS will not be operated directly over any person, except 
       authorized and consenting personnel necessary for the purpose, 
       below an altitude that is hazardous to persons or property on the 
       surface in the event of a UAS failure or emergency. 

  16. Regarding the distance from participating persons, Exhibit A 
       establishes safety mitigations for authorized and consenting 
       personnel. At all times, those persons must be essential to the 
       sUAS operation.    

  17. Regarding distance from nonparticipating persons, the operator 
       will ensure that no persons are allowed within 500 ft of the area 
       except those consenting to be involved and necessary for the 
       sUAS operation. 

  18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its Global Positioning 
       System (GPS) signal, the UAS will be programmed to return to a 
       predetermined location within the security perimeter and land or 
       be recovered in accordance with the Exhibit A&B. 

  19. The UAS will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles 
       or emergencies in accordance with the Exihbit A&B 

  20. Each UAS operation will be completed within 20 minutes of flight 
       time or with 30% battery power remaining, whichever occurs 
       first. 

  21. The operator will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued 
       Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) prior to conducting 
       any operations under an exemption. The operator will request a 
       Notice to Airman not more than 72 hours in advance, but not less 
       than 48 hours prior to the operation.  

 
 

  22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be 
       identified by serial number, registered in accordance with 14 
       C.F.R. Part 47, and have identification (N Number) markings in 
       accordance with 14 C.F.R. Part 45, subpt.C. Markings will be as 
       large as practicable. 

  23. The operator will develop procedures to document and maintain 
       a record of the UAS maintenance, preventative maintenance, 
       alterations, status of replacement/overhaul component parts, and 
       the total time in service of the UAS. These procedures will be 
       added to Exhibit C. 

  24. Each UAS operated under this exemption will comply with all 
       manufacturer safety bulletins, firmware, software updates and 
       will be documented and updated in Exhibit A & B. 

  25. Before conducting operations, the radio frequency spectrum 
       used for operation and control of the UA will comply with the 
       Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 

           A) Radio Control Model No. PVT 581. FCC ID: 553201309581 

           B) Range Extender Model No. RE 500. FCC ID: SS3              

              RE500130 

  26. The documents required under 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will 
       be available to the PIC at the ground control station of the UAS 

       any time the aircraft is operating. These documents will be made 

       available to the administrator, or governing body upon request. 

  27. The UAS will remain clear and yield the right of way to all other 
       manned operations and activities at all times (including, but not 
       limited to, ultralight vehicles, parachute activities, parasailing 
       activities, hang gliders, etc.).   

 
 

  28. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 
       14 C.F.R. § 1.1. Operations will only be conducted under visual 
       meteorological conditions (VMC).  

  29. The UAS will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device 
       or vehicle. 

  30. The UA will not be operated less than 500 ft below or less than 
       2,000 ft horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 
       statute miles. 

  31. The UA will not operate in Class B, C, or D airspace without 
       written approval from the FAA. The UA will not operate within 5 
       nautical miles of the geographic center of a nontowered airport 
       as denoted on a current FAApublished aeronautical chart unless 
       a letter of agreement with that airport's management is obtained, 
       and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM as 
       required by the operator's COA. The letter of agreement with the 
       airport management will be made available to the Administrator 
       upon request. 

  32. Incidents, accidents or flight operation that transgresses the 
       lateral or vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined 
       by the applicable COA will be reported to the Federal Aviation 
       Administration's (FAA) UAS Integration Office (AFS80) within 24 
       hours. Accidents will be reported to the National Transportation 
       Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB 
       web site: www.ntsb.gov. Further flight operations will not be 
       conducted until the incident or accident is reviewed by AFS80 
       and authorization to resume operations is provided. 

 

 

 

 
 

14 C.F.R. § 61.113(a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: 
Pilot in Command 

Sections 61.113(a) & (b) limit private pilots to noncommercial 
operations. Because the UAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the 
proposed operations can achieve the same level of safety of current 
operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have a private 
pilot's license rather than a commercial pilot's license in order to 
safely operate sUAS. As outlined in Exhibit A, all sUAS operations are 
carefully preplanned flights with written approval of MSWLFs 
operating agents prior to any operations. The level of safety provided 
by the requirements included in Exhibits A & B exceeds that provided 
by a single person holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a 
manned aircraft. The risks associated with the sUAS operation within 
the operational area are so diminished from the level of risk 
associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 that 
allowing operations of the sUAS as requested with a private pilot as 
the PIC meets and exceeds the present level of safety achieved by 14 
C.F.R. § 61.113(a) & (b).  

The FAA has granted exemptions for private pilots to conduct similar 
operations in Exemptions 11062 through 11067 and 11080. 

 

14 C.F.R. § 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes 

Section 91.119 sets forth safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. 
Section 91.119(c) allows helicopters to be operated at less than the 
minimums prescribed, providing that the person operating the 
helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for 
helicopters by the FAA. As this exemption is for a sUAS that is similar 
to a helicopter, and the exemption requests authority to operate at 
altitudes up to 400 ft AGL, an exemption will be needed to allow 
operations. Because the aerial data sets do not require flights greater 
than 400 ft (AGL), Sydor Aerial Photography LLC will not operate the 
UA at or greater than 400 ft (AGL). 

 
 

The FAA has previously granted exemptions to conduct similar 
operations in Exemptions 11062 through 11067 and 11080. 

 

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions 

Section 91.151(a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an 
airplane under VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast 
weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of 
intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ 1) During 
the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes or 2) At night, to fly 
after that for at least 45 minutes." 

The 5200mAh lithium polymer smart battery powering the sUAS 
provides approximately 25 minutes of flight. In order to meet the 
30minute reserve requirement in 14 C.F.R. § 91.151,  the sUAS 
flights would not be able to operate. Given the powered flight 
limitations of the sUAS within the restricted flight area of MSWLFs, a 
longer time frame for flight is reasonable. 

Sydor Aerial Photography LLC believes that an exemption from 14 
C.F.R. § 91.151(a) falls within the scope of prior approved 
exemptions. Ex. Exemption 10673. Flight operations via the sUAS 
within the controlled MSWLF operational area with less than 30 
minutes of reserve fuel, does not apply to the original intent of Section 
91.151 (a), given the sUAS size and speed. 

Sydor Aerial Photography LLC believes that an equal level of safety 
can be achieved by limiting flights to 20 minutes or 30% of battery 
power whichever occurs first. Limiting sUAS flights to 20 minutes or 
30% battery power allows the PIC adequate time to return the UA to 
its predetermined home landing position. 

Similar exemptions have been approved for other sUAS operations, 
including Exemptions 2689F, 5745, 10673, 10808 and Exemptions 
11062 through 11067 and 11080. 

 
 

14 C.F.R. § 91.405 (a) 407(a)(1) 409(a)(2) 417(a) & (b): 
Maintenance Inspections 

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall 
have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and 
shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in Part 
43 of this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft 
in compliance with Part 43. 

The above mentioned sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with 
an airworthiness certificate, therefore these sections do not apply to 
Sydor Aerial Photography LLC. Operational maintenance will be 
performed as outlined in Exhibit C. Due to the size of the UA and its 
camera an equal level of safety will be achieved. In the event of 
mechanical issues, during flight operations, the UA can be safely 
landed. Refer to Exhibit B failsafe procedures. As provided in Exhibits 
A and B the operator will ensure that the sUAS is in working order 
before the start of any sUAS operations. In addition, the PIC will 
perform required maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance 
performed. Since the operator is the person most familiar with the 
entire sUAS best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy 
condition to provide the equivalent level of safety. As outlined in 
Exhibit C annual inspection, maintenance will be performed by an 
independent third party not affiliated with Sydor Aerial Photography 
LLC. 

The FAA has granted exemptions for similar operations in Exemptions 
11062 through 11067 and 11080. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

     To satisfy 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for 
publication in the Federal Register. 

Sydor Aerial Photography LLC seeks an exemption from the following 
rules: 

14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113(a) & (b) 91.119(c) 91.151(a) 91.405(a) 
91.407(a) (1) 91.409(a)(2) and 91.417(a) & (b)  

     Sydor Aerial Photography LLC seeks approval, of the before 
mentioned exceptions, in order to commercially operate sUAS for the 
purpose of image mapping of active and closed MSWLF (Municipal 
Solid Waste Landfills).  

     Sydor Aerial Photography LLC Is a veteran owned sUAS company 
specializing in the gathering and post processing of aerial images for 
the purpose of creating survey grade orthomosaics. The sUAS are 
under 55 lbs and operate below 400 ft above AGL. In the spirit of 
Section 333, Sydor Aerial Photography LLC has limited its operating 
theatre to MSWLFs. Given the rural and sterile environment in which 
MSWLFs operate, safe flight sUAS operations can be accomplished. 

     Current surveying methods of MSWLFs include manned aircraft 
missions and/or ground survey teams. The integration of sUAS can 
dramatically reduce the cost of current data gathering methods. 
Additionally, the use of sUAS increases the safety of current data 
gathering methods by limiting the personal required to enter the 
MSWLFs thereby limiting those individuals to the hazards associated 
with mass movement of solid waste. 

     Sydor Aerial Photography LLC believes it's petition for exception 
satisfies the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012
(size, weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and 
populated areas, operation within visual line of sight, and national 
security) provide adequate justification for the grant of the requested 

 
 

exemptions allowing commercial operation of sUAS for the purpose of 
aerial data gathering over MSWLFs. 
Sydor Aerial Photography LLC further believes that it's petition for 
exception exceeds the level of safety established in the exemptions 
already granted, including Exemptions 11062 through 11067 and 
11080. 
 
Sincerely, 
Anthony Sydor
