President
SouthGate Films, Inc.
67 West Street, Suite 605

Dear Messrs. Callahan, Robinson, and Callahan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.
                                                                                                                 2

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated December 16, 20141, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on behalf of SouthGate Films, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct aerial filming and photography for short films, motion pictures, and
commercial filming.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI F550, Tarot T-15, and Tarot T-18.
The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C.  44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

1 By letter dated December 17, 2014, and posted to the public docket on December 29, 2014, the petitioner
provided additional information.
                                                                                             3

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, SouthGate Films, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR ㎣ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, SouthGate Films, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI F550, Tarot
    T-15, and Tarot T-18 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
                                                                                                            4

    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
    be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
                                                                                                            5

    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR  61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR  61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR  91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR  1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.
                                                                                                            6

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
    as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR ㎣ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
                                                                                               7

the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;
      c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
          the UAS;
      d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
      e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
      f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners

         Re: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation
                   Regulations from 14 CFR Part 21; 14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b); 91.7 (a); 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a);
                   91.405 (a); 91.407(a) (1); 91.409 (a) (2); 91.417 (a) & (b).

To whom it may concern:

         In accordance with Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ("Reform Act") and
14 C.F.R. Part 11, SouthGate Films, development and operations specialists for Unmanned Aircraft Systems
("UASs") which are setup to utilize aerial filming and photography for short films, motion pictures, and
commercial filming, submits this exemption petition application. SouthGate films seeks exemption from the
aforementioned listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARS") to permit the commercial operation of its UASs
providing that the operations are conducted only according to that which is provided in this petition for
exemption or as may be currently or in the future required by the FAA as found in Section 333.1, or any other
prevailing federal regulations.

         As outlined below, our request for exemption would allow the operation of small unmanned aircraft
systems under established preset conditions in the air that are 1) narrow in scope 2) pre-determined 3) access
controlled and 4) improve upon the safety operations that commercial filming currently employ (such as using
a manned helicopter for aerial footage). Approval of this petition for exemption would improve safety as well
as provide an opportunity to the Secretary of Transportation (the FAA Administrator's) to accomplish their
goal to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace
system." See Section 333(c) of Reform Act.

Law Office of William P. Callahan 515 Madison Ave., Suite 2304, New York, NY 10022 T: 212-889-3000 F: 212-889-3242  |1

SouthGate Films, Inc.
President Paul Callahan (paul@southgatefilms.com, T: 347-489-7890)
67 West Street, Suite 605
Brooklyn, NY 11222

SouthGate films hereby requests an exemption from the following regulations:

    14 CFR Part 21
    14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b)
    14 C.F.R. 91.7 (a)
    14 C.F. R. 91.119
    14 C.F.R. 91.121
    14 CFR 91.151 (a)
    14 CFR 91.405 (a)
    14 CFR 407 (a) (1)
    14 CFR 409 (a) (2)
    14 CFR 417 (a) & (b)

         The SouthGate Films exemption application is intended to achieve Congress' aims in passing Section
333(a) - (c) of the Reform Act. The reform act instructs the Secretary of Transportation to give consideration
to whether or not particular unmanned aircraft systems can successfully achieve sufficient safety measures
for inclusion in the national airspace system (NAS). Such an exemption from the regulations will only serve as
a temporary measure in anticipation of the fulfillment of the rulemaking requirement of Section 332 of the
Reform Act. In consideration of the petition the Secretary should consider which UASs are neither a danger to
participants of the NAS or the public at large or present the potential to threaten the national security of the
United States. These factors should be considered according to the Reform Act  333 (a):
 The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
 Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
 Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.
If the Secretary decides that such vehicles "may operate safely in the national airspace system, the Secretary
shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft in the national airspace system." Id.
333(c). SouthGate Films believes the provisions found in section 333 of the Reform Act creates an obligation
for the FAA to process applications for exemption and, if necessary, for the FAA to create standards for safe
use if such standards proposed in this petition for exemption fail to meet statutory requirements for approval.

         The authority for the FAA to issue such an exemption is expressly granted in The Federal Aviation Act.
This statutory authority's terms include an exemption for civil aircraft, as defined under 40101 of the Federal
Aviation Act, and includes UASs, with the intent to exempt such from the mandate that every civil aircraft be
required to possess a valid airworthiness certificate.

         If the Administrator finds the exemption request in the public interest the Administrator may grant an
exemption from requirements of the regulations promulgated under subsections (a) or (b) or sections
44702-44716 of this title. 49 U.S.C. 44701(f); See 49 USC 44711(a); 49 USC 44704; 14 CFR 91.203 (a) (1).

         The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under
subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of this title if the Administrator finds the
exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. 44701(f) See also 49 USC 44711(a); 49 USC 44704; 14 CFR
91.203 (a) (1).

         SouthGate Film's UASs are rotorcraft with a combined weight, including any necessary added filming
equipment, of 55lbs or less. The UASs are capable of moving in vertical and horizontal positions at the same
time. The UASs can hover and are restricted to speeds of no more than 25mph as implemented by the duly
trained operator. UASs operations will always be conducted within the line of sight of the operator and will
be limited to the confines of a properly secured area. For details about what constitutes a properly secured
area please see the SouthGate Film's safety operations manual attached as exhibit 1. This application for
exemption strongly expresses that the structure and operations of these UASs will "not create a hazard to
users of the national airspace system or the public." Reform Act 333 (b).

         It is congress's intent that the FAA allow commercial UAS operations to begin immediately through
the process of a granted exemption as long as the proposed operations satisfy the proper zone of safety. The
limited size, intended cargo (filming equipment) and secure locality ensure there is zero national security
threat stemming from granting approval of the operations of these particular UASs. The administrator should
grant this application request because it carries out the intent of Section 333 of the Reform Act in addition to
the authority of the Federal Aviation Act. The grant is in the best interests of the public because it limits
harmful environmental factors and enhances the safety of both the public at large and filming industry
workers. Applicants hereby request their application for exemption be considered and approved as soon as it
can be processed.

AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS AND SAFETY LEVEL EQUIVALENTS
         The applicant seeks to have this exemption cover only civil aircraft as described therein this petition

and subject to the limitations proposed within this petition or as should be found necessary by the FAA.
Motion picture filming companies already safely operate using combustible manned helicopters or other

Law Office of William P. Callahan 515 Madison Ave., Suite 2304, New York, NY 10022 T: 212-889-3000 F: 212-889-3242  |3
manned civil aircraft to achieve many tasks that non-combustible unmanned UASs can accomplish with the
equivalent or better level of safety.

         SouthGate Films proposes and agrees to the following limitations and conditions for commercial
filming UAS operations conducted under a granted FAA exemption:

    1. The total combined weight of the UASs and attached equipment will weigh 55lbs or less.
    2. At all times the pilot will operate the UAS in an unbroken visual line of sight (VLOS).
    3. No flight operations will fly for more than 30 consecutive minutes without first landing and changing

         the batteries and conducting necessary safety checks.
    4. Once the battery is at 25% the operator must begin return to ground procedures. The UASs are not

         permitted to operate below 20% battery.
    5. Maximum flight altitude shall not exceed 400 AGL.
    6. A minimum 3 man crew consisting of the UAS Pilot, Visual Observer,

         and Camera Operator is required to conduct operations.
    7. The UASs Pilot in Command (PIC) must have at least 25 documented hours operating UASs.
    8. The PIC must have the requisite knowledge about the components required to build and maintain the

         particular type of UASs type they are operating.
    9. A PIC will have a private pilot's certificate.
    10. A PIC will not operate an UAS within 5 miles of the center of an airport without permission from the

         local FSDO and clearance from the control tower of the airport.
    11. The pilot and observer will have at least a third class medical.
    12. UASs will only operate in a properly secured area. SouthGate Films pre flight safety procedures

         require a secured perimeter as described in their pre flight safety operations manual.
    13. A mandatory briefing that all participating personnel (persons allowed into the filming perimeter)

         must attend in order to go over all pre flight safety issues and procedures for the day.
    14. A FAA Form 7711-1, or an equivalent, modified as needed to fit the

         requested exemption, will be filed with the relevant Flight Standards District Office.
    15. A UAS may not operate unless persons within 100ft of operations have consented to being in the

         secured area, as provided in the SouthGate Film's pre operations safety manual. With certain
         enhanced safety procedures the required radius may be reduced as low as 30ft as described in the
         manual. No smaller distance radius shall be allowed without the express approval of the relevant
         FSDO.
    16. The relevant FSDO shall receive a written Activities Agenda at least 3 days before a proposed filming
         date.

    17. At all operational times the pilot and observer will be able to maintain contact through voice
         communication.

    18. Operations shall not be permitted in areas that do not have the consent of the property owners.
    19. Any necessary required permission and/or permits from territorial, state, county or city jurisdictions,

         local law enforcement, fire department, or appropriate government agencies will be obtained
         accordingly.
    20. In the case of emergency, loss of communications or other malfunction, the UASs are preset to be
         able to return to a pre specified location in a safe manner. The UASs can abort a flight in unexpected
         situations or other emergencies.
14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 C.F.R. 91.203 (a) (1)
         FAR 91.203 (a) (1) requires the establishment of a process for the granting of airworthiness
certificates. The process for obtaining an airworthiness certificate is provided for in 14 C.F.R., Subpart H, titled
Airworthiness Certificates. The small size of the UASs and limited perimeter of the secured operations area
allow for an equivalent level of safety as envisioned in Part 11 and Section 333 of the reform act. The FAA is
permitted to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement as provided in The Federal
Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. An exemption may be permitted after
consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, distance from airports and amount of persons
near areas of operation. A careful consideration of these factors makes it clear that UASs, lacking an
airworthiness certificate, but, implementing the proposed conditions and restrictions, can operate just as safe
if not safer than conventional aircraft with an airworthiness certificate.
         The UASs weigh less than 55 lbs with a full load and cannot carry a pilot or hold any passengers. The
UASs do not carry fuel or any other explosive or flammable liquids, and will only be operated within the
secured zone as provided for in the SouthGate Film's safety manual. The petition for exemption will only
allow for tightly controlled and very closely observed operations as described in the SouthGate Film's safety
manual. The FAA will be informed in advance of the operations area and all local laws will be followed and
abided by. SouthGate Film's UAS operations without an airworthiness certificate will be safer than
conventional aircraft operating with an airworthiness certificate because of the conduct limitations provided
for in this petition that are inapplicable to the latter. The UASs safety requirements are similar to
requirements used in the production and filming industry for civilian aircraft.
         The UASs operations do not pose a threat to the national security of the United States, or any locality
found within or without the United States. The purpose of the operations of the UASs is to create footage for
the filming commercial and movie industry and is not intended in any way for hostile acts. The size, speed,
area of operations, absence of flammable gasoline or other combustible liquids and limitations on payload
weight present no credible threat to the United States.

14 C.F.R.  61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command.
         SouthGate films seeks exemption from 61.113 so that it's PIC may hold a private pilot's certificate

instead of a commercial pilot's certificate. In Grant of Exemption No. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (Astraeus), the
FAA determined that a PIC with a private pilot's certificate operating the Astraeus UAS would "not adversely
affect operations in the NAS or present a hazard to persons or property on the ground". SouthGate Film's
safety training provides an equivalent level of safety and potentially helps exceed current safety levels when
compared to manned aerial flights. The knowledge SouthGate Films has about UAS operations is relevant and
supplements the safety awareness the PIC learns from getting a private pilot's certificate. SouthGate Films
provides safety and education through the use of the safety operations manual, pre flight safety checks and
proper care for it's UASs.
14 C.F.R. 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

         A grant of exemption from 91.7 is needed because there will be no airworthiness certificate. The
airworthy conditions will be determined according to the SouthGate film's safety manual. The pre flight
safety procedures found in the SouthGate film's manual provides for an equivalent level of safety. The PIC
will be responsible for making sure the aircraft is airworthy before each flight.
14 C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum safe altitudes

         Section 91.119 establishes the safe altitudes for operations of civil aircraft. This request for exemption
asks for the submitted UASs to be permitted to operate at altitudes up to 400 AGL. All operations will occur in
a pre secured area where all persons and property present will have given their informed consent. The
location, size, weight and speed of the UASs provide for an equivalent level of safety. Conventional aircraft
flying below 500 AGL present a much greater risk to persons and property than small UASs operating at the
same altitude. Risks to conventional aircraft that are not applicable to UASs include combustible fuel and
large payloads. The low altitude will actually create an unintended buffer between UASs operating below 400
AGL and conventional aircraft operating above 500 AGL as required by Section 91.119.

         Section 91.119(c) provides that no aircraft shall operate within 500 AGL of any "person, vessel, vehicle
or structure". Due to the commercial filming nature of the UASs operations, we request filming operations be
permitted from much closer distances. This would all take place in accordance with pre flight safety
procedures. The operations manual provides that all persons within 100ft must give their consent to be
present and that such permission may be reduced to 30ft with enhanced safety procedures in place in
addition to the mandatory safety briefing involving all persons including the PIC. Filming with UASs instead of
manned helicopters provides an increased level of safety to the public and the crew working on the set.
14 C.F.R. 91.121 Altimeter Settings

         91.121 contains language requiring an aircraft to maintain an altimeter. The UASs do not have a
traditional barometric altimeter and therefore an exemption may be needed. The UASs are, however, able to

provide an equivalent level of safety through use of GPS altitude equipment. The GPS component attached to
the UAS uses a communications telemetry data link to send the AGL information to the PIC to effectively
monitor safety and the flight path. Methods include GPS triangulation, digitally encoded barometric
altimeter, radio altimeter or any combination. The GPS on the UAS transmits the appropriate data digitally to
a ground readout handheld controlled by the PIC. The UAS PIC will reset the altitude to zero before every
launch.
14 C.F.R.  91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

         Section 91.151 (a) disallows aircraft from flying without first having at least 30 minutes of fuel beyond
their time to take off and land under normal conditions if its during the day and 45 minutes for the night.
Since the UASs can only operate for 30-45mins total, before landing and replacing their batteries, an
exemption may be needed. Allowing UAS operations until battery life has reached 20% of it's full strength will
ensure an equivalent level of safety compared to conventional aircraft operations with 30 minutes extra fuel.
The UAS is set to automatically return to a pre determined landing spot in the case of emergency and this can
be accomplished very quickly. Conventional aircraft generally have less flexibility for landing than a small
lightweight UAS.
14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections

         These regulations are for conventional aircraft with an airworthiness certificate and are therefore
incompatible with the operations of an UAS. SouthGate Film's UAS operators are the best suited people to
perform maintenance on the UASs. This is because they have specialized knowledge about the components
that a typical aviation inspector would lack. The size, payload, location restrictions and height limits allow for
an equivalent level of safety. Maintenance shall be performed on a daily basis as required and a log of all
maintenance activities kept.

unmanned aerial systems (weighing less than 55lbs) for aerial filming and photography for short films, motion
pictures, and commercial filming.

         Approval for this section 333 exemption will increase public safety and reduce the risk to on set
personnel and property. Currently, most aerial filming is done by various filming studios using manned
airplanes. These airplanes weigh thousands of pounds and require the use of combustible gasoline in order
to operate. In comparison, an Unmanned Aerial System can accomplish the same commercial filming
