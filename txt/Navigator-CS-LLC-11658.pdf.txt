                                                           Exemption No. 11658
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0546

Ms. Gladys M. Miller
Senior Project Engineer
Navigator CS, LLC
1523 Kinnaird Terrace NE
Leesburg, VA 20176

Dear Ms. Miller:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 2, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Navigator CS, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial imaging in support of engineering surveys of construction sites, existing
buildings and facilities, and other sites, for the purpose of monitoring and ensuring site safety,
proper material usage, quality of workmanship, and/or to inspect the integrity of buildings
and/or structures, including bridges and dams.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Navigator CS, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Navigator CS, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
         weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
         aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption                                                                                                            i
A. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 11 and Section 333 of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95), Navigator CS, LLC
("Navigator") hereby applies for an exemption from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed in
table 1, to allow commercial operation of its small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) Inspire 1,
manufactured by DJI Innovations, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the
conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333 of Public Law
112-95 or as later modified by Navigator under the approval of the FAA subsequent to future
amendments.

This petition uses as guides prior petitions for exemptions and their corresponding FAA rulings, as well
as the FAA's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) Docket No.: FAA-2015-0150, Notice No. 15-01,
published on February 15, 2015. On this NPRM, the FAA proposes to add a new part 107 to Title 14 Code
of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) to allow for routine civil operation of small UAS in the national air space
(NAS) and to provide safety rules for those operations. Because the proposed part 107 regulation is not
final, and mindful that the final regulation might need to be redacted to address public comments,
Navigator is proposing actions that will allow its sUAS operations to achieve an equivalent level of safety
or that will meet the intent of (1) the airworthiness provisions of 14 CFR part 21; (2) airman certification
provisions of 14 CFR part 61; and operating limitations of 14 CFR part 91, all of which will be replaced by
14 CFR part 107.

The most onerous requirement imposed to date by the FAA as a condition for exemption from current
manned aircraft regulations, involves the requirement that the sUAS be operated by a Pilot-In-
Command (PIC) holding a private pilot certificate and a third-class airman medical certification. The
knowledge currently necessary to obtain a private pilot certificate does not equip the certificate holder
with the tools necessary to safely operate a sUAS. Therefore, the PIC must demonstrate that s/he is able
to safely operate the sUAS in a manner consistent with how the sUAS will be operated under the given
exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers, and maintaining appropriate distances from
people, vessels, vehicles, and structures.

The proposed part 107 replaces the PIC certification requirement with the requirement that the sUAS be
operated by an operator holding an "Unmanned Aircraft Operator Certificate With a Small UAS Rating"
(see proposed 14 CFR 107.13 (a)). To obtain this certificate, the individual must be at least 17 years of
age; demonstrate English language proficiency (read, write, speak and understand English); and pass an
initial aeronautical knowledge test in addition to demonstrating competency operating the sUAS.
Navigator will comply with the operator requirements in place at the time the FAA grants this petition.

In the following sections, Navigator discusses the actions that it proposes to take to ensure that its sUAS
operations do not create a hazard to the users of the NAS or the public, or pose a threat to national
security. Navigator also discusses how its proposed sUAS operations will be of benefit to the public.

Navigator is a properly verified service disabled veteran-owned small business performing engineering
and management consulting services in support of the construction, real estate, property management,
and information security industries. Navigator is the operator of the Inspire 1, a sUAS equipped to
conduct aerial filming and photography.

A.2 Intended Operations

This exemption will allow Navigator to use its sUAS Inspire 1 to safely, efficiently, and economically
obtain aerial imaging in support of engineering surveys of construction sites, existing buildings and
facilities, and other sites, for the purpose of monitoring and ensuring site safety, proper material usage,
quality of workmanship and/ or to inspect the integrity of buildings and/or structures, including but not
limited to bridges, dams and others.

A.3 Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS)

The Inspire 1 sUAS manufactured by DJI Innovations consists of a lightweight (6.5 lbs.) battery operated
quadcopter measuring 17.2 x 17.8 x 11.9 in., a tablet-based ground control station and/or RC Controller,
and associated communications equipment. The rotorcraft is a multirotor helicopter that is lifted and
propelled by four rotors. It carries an onboard geo-referenced gimbaled camera that allows it to obtain
photography and videography.

Under normal conditions, the Inspire 1 operates at a speed of no more than 22 meters per second (50
mph; 43 knots) and has the capability to hover and move in the vertical and horizontal plane
simultaneously. The battery is a lithium polymer LiPo 6S high voltage battery. The maximum flight
time is 18 minutes. The complete specifications for the Inspire 1 are contained in the "Inspire 1
Operating Handbook" contained in Attachment B.

A.4 Relief Sought

Table 1 lists the regulations from which Navigator is seeking relief. Each of these is discussed in
detail in Section D, "Regulations for Which Exemptions is Sought," along with Navigator's proposed
actions to provide an equivalent level of safety or to meet the intent of the regulation.

Table 2 lists regulations for which numerous petitioners have sought relief, but from which Navigator is
not seeking relief either because (1) they are not applicable to Navigator's planned operations, or (2)
because the FAA has determined that relief is not necessary. To ensure that the FAA does not consider
this an oversight on the part of Navigator, Section E of this petition discusses each of the regulations in
Table 2, the reason why Navigator is not seeking relief, and actions that Navigator proposes to take to
ensure that the intent of the regulation is met, or that the sUAS operations provide an equivalent level
of safety.

B. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR EXEMPTIONS

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA authority to issue exemptions. This statutory
authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under §40101 of the Act, including
sUAS, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current airworthiness certificate. The
Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption                                         3
subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of this title if the Administrator
finds the exemption to be in the public interest. 49 USC 44701(f). See also 49 USC §4471 l(a); 49
USC 44704; 14 CFR 91.203(a)(l).

In order to determine whether certain sUAS may operate safely in the NAS pursuant to section 333 of
Public Law 112-95, the Secretary must find that the operation of the UAS would not: (1) create a hazard
to users of the NAS or the public; or (2) pose a threat to national security. The Secretary must also
determine whether small UAS operations pose a safety risk sufficient to require airworthiness
certification.

Section 333(c) of Public Law 112-95 further states that if the Secretary determines that a sUAS "may
operate safely in the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe
operation of such aircraft in the national airspace system."

B.1 Hazard to Users of the NAS or the Public

Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 requires the Secretary to determine whether the operation of the
sUAS would create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public. The two primary safety concerns
associated with sUAS operations are: (1) the ability to "see and avoid" other aircraft with no pilot on
board; and (2) the operator losing positive control of the sUA aircraft. Navigator will mitigate these
concerns by adhering to the provisions listed in Table 3, which are in line with proposed regulation 14
CFR part 107.

The light weight of the Inspire 1, coupled with the provisions listed in Table 3, significantly reduce the
risk posed by Navigator's proposed sUAS operations when compared with other categories of aircraft
that weigh more, fly higher, and are faster. Therefore, Navigator's sUAS operations would not create a
hazard to users of the NAS or to the public.

B.2 Threat to National Security

Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 also requires the Secretary to determine whether the operation of the
sUAS would pose a threat to national security. Under proposed 14 CFR part 107, these operations would
be subject to specific requirements, such as being able to operate only during daylight and only within
visual line of sight of the operator and, if applicable, a visual observer. The sUA would also have to be
registered with the FAA and to display its FAA-issued registration marking prominently on the aircraft.

In addition, the operator of the sUA will be required to obtain a FAA-issued "Unmanned Aircraft
Operator Certificate With a Small UAS Rating." The process for obtaining this certificate will include the
same TSA-review procedures that are currently used under 49 USC 46111 to screen out airman-
certificate applicants posing a security risk. These provisions, coupled with those contained in Table 3,
which Navigator will follow for all sUAS commercial operations, will ensure that Navigator's sUAS
operations will not pose a threat to national security.

B.3 Airworthiness Certification

Section 333(b)(2) of Public Law 112-95 requires the Secretary to determine whether small UAS
operations pose a safety risk sufficient to require airworthiness certification. In previous exemptions, as
well as in the preamble of the FAA's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) [Docket No.: FAA-2015-
0150; Notice No. 15-01] published on February 15, 2015, the Secretary has determined that
airworthiness certification should not be required for sUAS due to their low-risk operational
characteristics. In addition, the provisions listed in Table 3 and the pre-flight checks that will be
performed (see Attachment A, "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned Aircraft
System (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations") significantly reduce the risk associated with sUAS
operations.

In the above referenced NPRM, the FAA emphasizes that the operator of the sUAS will not need to
determine design conformity or reliability probabilities when evaluating the airworthiness of the sUAS.
Instead, the operator will need to make a determination of whether the sUAS is in a safe condition
during flight operations and ground operations conducted for the purpose of flight. During pre-flight and
post-flight inspections, the sUAS operator should conduct a simple visual inspection to look for simple
items such as dents, corrosion, misalignment, loose wires, binding controls, loose fasteners, and
excessive wear. This simple but not all-inclusive list will identify most problems that could impact the
airworthiness and reliability of the aircraft.

Another inspection method unique to sUAS that would be governed by proposed rule 107 will be a
check of the control link. This check can be accomplished by using the control station to verify proper
flight control deflection prior to flight. The check can also be used to ensure the flight controls deflect
freely, without binding. Like the aforementioned inspection items, this too is a simple visual inspection
that should not require specialized training, and is included in "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist
for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations" in Attachment A.

Because (1) the proposed airworthiness provisions discussed above would sufficiently ensure that the
sUAS is in a condition for safe operation; and (2) the provisions listed in Table 3 and the "Navigator CS,
LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations"
contained in Attachment A of this petition would ensure that the risk posed by small unmanned aircraft
is significantly smaller than the public risk posed by other groups of aircraft, pursuant to section
333(b)(2) of Public Law 112-95, airworthiness certification would be unnecessary for the sUAS.

                            Navigator's Provisions to Mitigate Safety and Security Risks                                         For       Proposed for
                                                                                                                               Manned          sUAS
General Provisions:                                                                                                            Aircraft
   The maximum gross weight of the sUA will be 6.5 lbs. This is below the 55-lb limit in the definition of small unmanned
     aircraft contained in Public Law 112-95, sec. 331(6).                                                                                 14 CFR 107:
   The airspeed of the SUA will not exceed 43 knots (50 mph). This is half the FAA proposed maximum airspeed of 87 knots.
   The sUAS will not be operated unless it is in condition for safe operation, as determined by Navigator's preflight checks   91.7 (b)    51(a)
     and regular maintenance procedures.                                                                                                   15(a)
   The flight of the sUA will be discontinued if conditions develop such that continuing the flight would pose a hazard to
     other aircraft, people, or property.                                                                                                  15(b)
   The sUA will have enough power to operate for its intended operational time and an additional four minutes. See
     Section D.7 of this petition for Navigator's reasoning on this matter.                                                                49 (a)(4)

sUA Registration and Markings Provisions:                                                                                      45.29(f)    14 CFR 107:
   The sUA will be registered with the FAA.                                                                                                13(b)
   The registration number will be displayed on the aircraft in as large a manner as practicable. The location of the display              13(c)
     will be as prescribed for the type of aircraft.
                                                                                                                                           14 CFR 107:
sUAS Maintenance Provisions:                                                                                                               21(a)
   The operator will maintain the sUAS in a condition for safe operation by performing the manufacturer's recommended
     maintenance at manufacturer-recommended regular intervals.                                                                91.13 & 15  14 CFR 107:
                                                                                                                               91.17
Operator and Visual Observer (VO) Provisions:                                                                                              13(a)
   The sUAS will be operated by a pilot-in-command (PIC) holding a pilot private certificate.                                              33
   As soon as the process to obtain the "Unmanned Aircraft Operator Certificate with a Small UAS Rating" is established
     and operational, Navigator will use a holder of this certificate for the operation of its sUAS.                                       35
   Navigator will use a VO for its sUAS operations. The VO will not be allowed to operate the sUA. The operator will ensure                23
     that the VO is able to see the sUA as specified in part 107.31 and 37
   The operator and VO will only participate in the operation of one sUAS at a time.                                                       27
   When operating the sUAS, the operator will refrain from careless or reckless behavior that could endanger the life or
     property of other. This includes not dropping objects as to create a hazard to persons or property.
   The operator and VO will comply with the FAA alcohol and drug use prohibitions.

1 While Navigator has made an attempt to reference relevant existing and proposed regulations pertaining to hazards to users of the NAS and the Public and

threats to national security that apply to sUAS operations, the references identified on this Table are not all inclusive.

Pre-flight Inspections, Assessments, and Checks:
   The operator will inspect the sUAS to ensure that it is in a condition for safe operation. This includes performing the                 49(a)(1)
      manufacturer-recommended preflight inspection and/or performing an on-the-ground test of the sUAS to determine
      whether safety-critical systems and components are working properly.                                                                     19(b)
   The operator will ensure that all links between the control station and the sUA are working properly. In the event that a
      control link is not functioning properly, flight will not commence until the problem is resolved.
   The operator will become familiar with the confined area of operation by assessing the operating environment and risks
      to persons and property in the immediate vicinity both on the surface and in the air. As part of this pre-flight
      assessment, the operator will consider conditions that could pose a hazard to the operation of the sUAS, as well as
      conditions in which the operation of the sUAS could pose a hazard to other aircraft or persons or property on the
      ground. Special consideration will be given to:

           (1) local weather conditions;
           (2) local airspace and any flight restrictions;
           (3) the location of persons and property on the ground;
           (4) overhead wires and power transmission cables, and
           (5) any other ground or air hazards.
   The operator will compare the GPS altitude read-out with the launch site altitude to ensure proper readings.
   The operator will ensure that the sUAS will pose no undue hazard to other aircraft, people or property in the event of
      loss of control of the aircraft for any reason.

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  9
C. PUBLIC INTEREST

This application for exemption is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section 333(a)
through (c) of P ublic L aw 1 1 2 -9 5 . This law directs the Secretary to consider whether certain
u n m a n n e d a i r c r a f t s y s t e m s m ay operate safely in the NAS before completion of the
rulemaking required under Section 333 of the Law. By granting this exemption, the FAA will fulfill
Congress's intent of allowing sUAS to operate with significant safety precautions in low risk
environments.

The use of sUAS to obtain aerial imaging in support of engineering surveys of construction sites, existing
buildings and facilities, and other sites, for the purpose of monitoring and ensuring site safety, proper
material usage, quality of workmanship and/ or to inspect the integrity of buildings and/or structures,
including but not limited to bridges, dams and others, can significantly reduce the risk to workers
arising from falls while inspecting, surveying, or monitoring site progress. Sm all UAS can take
video and photos, and collect data on high and hard-to-get-to areas, such as building exteriors,
towers, and roofs that otherwise would require worker inspection. Falls are the leading source of
workplace fatality and injury on construction sites2 and reducing t h e po s sib i l ity o f falls by using
sUAS for site imaging could significantly reduce the safety risk for workers performing many
such inspections, ultimately save workers' lives.

Additionally, sUAS could replace the use of helicopters and small aircraft to monitor sites and take
site/project progress photographs. Navigator's selected sUAS weighs 6 . 5 l b s a n d c a r r i e s no
explosiv e materials o r flamm able liquid fuels on board, as opposed to much larger,
conventionally powered small aircraft. The use of sUAS over helicopters presents a substantial increase
in safety for workers and the public.

When used for aerial imaging and data collection over construction and other sites, the Inspire 1's
rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery (LiPo 6S) has a reduced environmental impact over fossil fuel
burned to operate much heavier small aircrafts.

D. REGULATIONS FROM WHICH EXEMPTION IS SOUGHT

The regulations from which Navigator is seeking relief are listed in Table 1 of this petition. This Section
discusses each of these regulations, the reasons why Navigator is seeking relief, and Navigator's
provisions to assure an equivalent level of safety, as applicable.

D.1 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates

Subpart H, Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of
airworthiness certificates as required by FAR 91.203 (a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area
associated with the aircraft to be utilized by Navigator, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H meets the

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption                                                                        10
requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of Public Law 112-95.

The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.44701 (f)) and Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 authorize the FAA to
exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the
sUAS' size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and populated areas.

As discussed in Section B.3 of this petition, the FAA has determined in previous exemptions that
airworthiness certification should not be required for sUAS due to their low-risk operational
characteristics. The provisions listed in Table 3 and on "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations, " contained in Attachment A of this
petition significantly reduce the risk associated with Navigator's sUAS operations. During preflight and
post flight inspections, Navigator will seek to identify problems that could impact the airworthiness and
reliability of the sUAS. In addition, before each flight, the control link will be checked to ensure proper
flight control. These combined efforts will ensure that Navigator's sUAS is in a condition for safe
operation.

An analysis of these provisions demonstrates that Navigator's sUAS operated without an airworthiness
certificate, in the restricted environment, and under the provisions in Table 3 and "Navigator CS, LLC's
Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations"
contained in Attachment A, will be as safe as, or safer than, conventional aircraft operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

Navigator's Inspire 1 weighs less than 10 lbs., carries neither a pilot nor passenger, carries no explosive
materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exclusively within a secured area as set out in Table 3
of this petition. Like other civil aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and
monitored by the operator, and will be in compliance with local public safety requirements, to provide
security for the area of operation as is currently done on active construction sites. These safety
enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in connection with construction sites,
provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property owners than conventional operations
conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H.

The FAA has previously granted exemptions from this regulation, some examples of which may be found
in Exemption Nos. 11062, 11067, 11080, 11112, 11114, and 11138.

D.2 14 CFR 61.113(a) and (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot
       in Command

Section 61.113(a) and (b) prescribe that

    (a) No person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as a pilot in command (PIC) of an aircraft that is

          carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire,
          act as PIC of an aircraft.

     (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as PIC of an aircraft in connection with any business or
          employment if

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  11
             (1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and
             (2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire.

Unlike a conventional aircraft, which is operated by an onboard pilot, Navigator's sUA will not carry
a pilot, passengers, or any other life form on board. The sUA will be remotely controlled and, as
shown on the provisions contained in Table 3 and on "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist
for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations" contained in
Attachment A, the area of operation will be controlled and restricted, and all flights will be
planned and coordinated in advance. These provisions are consistent with the requirements
proposed by the FAA in NPRM Docket No. FAA-2015-0150, Notice No. 15-01, dated February 15,
2015, and significantly reduce the risk of Navigator's sUA operations compared with the level of
risk posed by the commercial operations governed by Part 61.

To date, the FAA has granted petitions for exemption similar to this one, and has authorized
sUAS to be operated by a PIC with a private pilot certificate and third-class airman medical
certification. The PIC has been required to demonstrate his/her ability to operate the sUAS. In
the above referenced NPRM, the FAA proposed that sUA be operated by an operator holding
an "Unmanned Aircraft Operator Certificate with a sUAS Rating." Navigator will comply with the
requirements current at the time this petition is granted, which will provide an equivalent level of
safety as that achieved by 14 CFR 61.113(a) and (b).

The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation as shown in Exemption Nos. 11062,
11065, 11067, 11110, 11109, 11136 and 11138.

D.3 14 CFR 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

Section 91.7(a) prescribes that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, there will be no FAA regulatory standard for determining
airworthiness. The size and operational characteristics of the aircraft, the provisions outlined in
Table 3 of this petition related to preflight inspections, checks, assessments, and maintenance,
and on "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS)
Used in Commercial Operations" contained in Attachment A of this petition, which incorporate
the FAA's proposed requirements for sUAS, will ensure that the Inspire 1 is in a condition for
flight. Therefore, an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

The FAA has granted exemptions from this regulation in several instances, including Exemption Nos.
11080, 11109, 11136, 11138, 11150, 11153, 11157, and 11159.

D.4 14 CFR 91.103(b): Preflight Action

Section 91.103 prescribes that the aircraft's pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become
familiar with all available information concerning that flight. This information must include:

(b) For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following takeoff and landing distance

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  12
          information:

             (1) For civil aircraft for which an approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual containing takeoff and
                   landing distance data is required, the takeoff and landing distance data contained therein; and

             (2) For civil aircraft other than those specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, other reliable
                   information appropriate to the aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under expected values of
                   airport elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and temperature.

Navigator seeks relief from this regulation because the type of information and actions required to
ensure the safe operation of a sUA are different from those called for in 14 CFR 91.103 (b). The
Provisions contained in Table 3, particularly those pertaining to preflight inspections, assessments, and
checks, and completion of "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems
(sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations" shown in Appendix A of this petition, will ensure an equivalent
level of safety as that provided for conventional aircraft governed by 14 CFR 91.103(b).

D.5 14 CFR 91.119(c): Minimum Safe Altitudes

Section 91.119 prescribes that, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate
an aircraft below the following altitudes:

     (a) Anywhere. An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to
          persons or property on the surface.

     (b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open-air
          assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of
          2,000 feet of the aircraft.

     (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or
          sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any
          person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.

     (d) Helicopters, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control aircraft. If the operation is conducted without
          hazard to persons or property on the surface

             (1) A helicopter may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c)
                   of this section, provided each person operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes
                   specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA; and

             (2) A powered parachute or weight-shift-control aircraft may be operated at less than the minimums
                   prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

Section 91.119(d) allows helicopters to be operated at less than the minimum prescribed altitudes,
provided the person operating the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for
helicopters by the FAA. This petition of exemption is for a quadcopter that flies similarly to a helicopter,
with vertical take-off and vertical landing, which will typically operate at altitudes of 200 feet above
ground level (AGL) or less. Therefore, an exemption will be needed to allow such operations.

As stated in Table 3, Navigator intends to conduct its sUAS operations in secure, confined areas that are
not congested. To this effect, the only portion of this regulation from which Navigator seeks relief is
119(c), which sets the minimum flying altitude to 500 feet AGL. This is the maximum allowable flying

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  13
altitude proposed by the FAA in NPRM Docket No. FAA-2015-0150, Notice No. 15-01, published on
February 15, 2015.

Navigator's sUA will not operate over any person that is not directly involved in the operation of the
sUAS unless these persons are protected by a structure. Further, prior to its sUAS commercial
operations, Navigator will ensure that:

    (1) All persons directly involved in the sUAS operation receive a briefing that includes operating
         conditions, emergency procedures, contingency procedures, roles and responsibilities, and
         potential hazards;

    (2) All persons not essential to flight operations (nonparticipating persons) remain at least 500 ft.
         away from the area of operations unless they are protected by barriers or structures that can
         sufficiently protect non-participating persons from debris in the event of an accident. The
         operator will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under or within such protection. If a
         situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
         the sUA, flight operations will cease immediately or the operator will move the aircraft to a safe
         distance, whichever is safer.

    (3) In the event that operations need to be conducted closer than 500 ft. from vessels, vehicles
         and/or structures, Navigator will first obtain permission from the owner/controller, and the
         operator will make a safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects.

The size, weight, and speed of the Inspire 1, combined with the provisions listed above and in Table 3
and Attachment A of this petition will ensure the safety of Navigator's sUAS operations and will provide
an equivalent level of safety as that intended for conventional aircraft governed by 14 CFR 91.119,
which are heavier and carry flammable fuel.

Some of the exemptions where the FAA has granted relief from this regulation include Exemption Nos.
4063, 11062, 11063, 11066, 11067, 11080, 11109, 11110, 11112, 11136, and 11138.

D.6 14 CFR 91.121: Altimeter Settings

Section 91.121 requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by reference
to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate altimeter
setting available before departure."

Navigator requests relief from this regulation because its sUAS does not have a barometric
altimeter but a Global Positioning System (GPS) altitude read-out whose altitude information is
generated by GPS equipment installed onboard the aircraft. Prior to each flight, the GPS read-out
will be verified by the operator by comparing it to the launch site altitude, thus setting the zero altitude
initiation point. To actively monitor the flight path, the sUAS operator will have access to altitude
information via a radio communications telemetry data link which downlinks from the sUA to the
operator. These provisions, coupled with Navigator's intent to operate its sUA within VLOS below 500

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  14
feet AGL, will ensure the safety of Navigator's sUAS operations, and will provide an equivalent level of
safety as that intended by the provisions of 14 CFR 91.121 for conventional aircraft.

The FAA has granted relief from this regulation, as shown in Exemption Nos. 11136, 11138, 11150,
11153 and 11159.

D.7 14 CFR 91.151(a)(1): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

Section 91.151(a) prescribes that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under visual flight rules
(VFR) conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed

     (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or
     (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

As indicated in Table 3, Navigator will conduct its sUAS operations in daylight; for this reason, the fuel
requirement for night operations covered under 151(a)(2) is not applicable, and Navigator is only
seeking relief from 151(a)(1). This relief is required because the battery that powers the Inspire 1
provides approximately 18 minutes of powered flight, thus making it unfeasible to meet this 30-minute
fuel reserve requirement.

An equivalent level of safety will be provided by commanding the aircraft to return to the ground
control station when the battery has 20% of power remaining. It should be noted that in its proposed
regulations for sUAS, the FAA is requiring that the sUAS have enough power for its intended operational
flight plus 5 minutes. Given the short (18 minute) flight duration allowed for the Inspire 1 by its battery
power, Navigator's 20% battery power provision will allow 14 minutes of flight time and leave 4 minutes
of battery reserve. While this does not meet the 5 minutes in the proposed regulation we feel it
provides a significant safety margin, complies with the current requirement and provides a reasonable
flight time without adversely affecting the safety of the operations. Navigator's proposed provision has
been found acceptable by the FAA on previous exemptions, including Exemption No. 11109.

Navigator's provision to return the aircraft to the ground control station when the battery reaches 20%
of power can be easily carried out because when in flight, the remaining battery power of the Inspire 1
is shown live on the operator's display, letting the operator know the remaining flight time. Built-in
algorithms calculate the distance of the aircraft and the estimated time to return to the ground control
station, which allows the operator to know when it's time to fly back. These features, combined with the
above flight-duration provision, the confined nature of the operating area, and the size, weight, speed,
and construction material of the Inspire 1 will ensure the safety of Navigator's sUAS operations.

To date, the FAA has granted relief from this regulation to sUAS for daytime, VFR conditions. Examples
of these exemptions include Exemption Nos. 2689F, 5745, 8811, 10159, 10650, 10673, 10808, 11112,
11136 and 11138.

                must include

                     (i) A description (or reference to data acceptable to the Administrator) of the work performed;
                           and

                     (ii) The date of completion of the work performed; and
                     (iii) The signature and certificate number of the person approving the aircraft for return to

                           service.
          (2) Records containing the following information:

                     (i) The total time in service of the airframe, each engine, each propeller, and each rotor.
                     (ii) The current status of life-limited parts of each airframe, engine, propeller, rotor, and

                           currently installed engines, rotors, propellers, and appliances.
     (b) The owner or operator shall retain the following records for the periods prescribed:

          (1) The records specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be retained until the work is repeated or
                superseded by other work or for 1 year after the work is performed.

          (2) The records specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be retained and transferred with the
                aircraft at the time the aircraft is sold.

          (3) A list of defects furnished to a registered owner or operator under § 43.11 shall be retained until the
                defects are repaired and the aircraft is approved for return to service.

Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, these
sections will not apply to Navigator's sUAS. However, Navigator's sUAS operator will ensure
that the Inspire 1 is in proper working condition prior to initiating flight operations (see
Provisions in Table 3 and "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned
Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations" contained in Attachment A of this
petition). Regular preventive maintenance will be accomplished i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h t h e
manufacturer's operating manual. The date and type of preventive and corrective maintenance will
be documented on the sUA log, which will be made available to FAA personnel upon request.

The above provisions, combined with the Inspire 1's size and weight and the confined area where it
will be operated for short periods of time, will achieve an equivalent or level of safety as that
intended by these regulations for conventional aircraft.

The FAA has granted similar exemptions from these regulations, as shown in Exemption Nos.
11080, 11109, 11136, 11138, 11150, 11153, 11157 and, 11159.

E. REGULATIONS FROM WHICH RELIEF IS NOT SOUGHT

As mentioned earlier, previous petitioners have sought relief from other regulations which the FAA has
determined are not necessary or applicable. To ensure that the FAA does not consider this an oversight
on the part of Navigator, those regulations are discussed next, along with the reason why Navigator is
not seeking relief, and the actions that Navigator proposes to take to ensure that the intent of the
regulation is met, or that its sUAS operations provide an equivalent level of safety.

E.1 14 CFR 45.23(b): Marking of the Aircraft

This regulation prescribes that:

     (b) When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the registration number is displayed on limited,
          restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator
          must also display on that aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not
          less than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport,"
          "experimental," or "provisional," as applicable.

As stated by the FAA on previous rulings (see Exemption No. 11109), this regulation applies only to
aircraft with an experimental certificate under 14 CFR Part 21.191, which is not the case here. For this
reason, Navigator is not seeking relief from this regulation. Navigator's sUAS will be identified by serial

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  17
number, it will be registered with the FAA in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and will have identification
(N- Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as
practicable.

E.2 14 CFR 91.9 (b)(2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual, Marking, and Placard
       Requirements

Section 91.9(b)(2) prescribes, in pertinent part, that no person may operate a US-registered civil aircraft
unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual,
approved manual material, markings, and placards, or any combination thereof.

Due to its small size and configuration, the sUA has no ability or place to carry a flight manual
on the aircraft; therefore, an exemption is required. On previous exemptions, however, the FAA
has stated that based on the FAA's memorandum titled "Interpretation regarding whether certain
required documents may be kept at an UA's control station" dated August 8, 2014, relief is not
necessary. Navigator will achieve an equivalent level of safety by keeping the flight manual at the
ground control point where the PIC/operator flying the sUAS will have immediate access to it.

E.3 14 CFR 91.109: Flight Instruction

Section 91.109 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon)
that is being used for flight instruction, unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls. By
design, sUAS and remotely piloted aircraft do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control
is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft via radio
communications. The FAA has previously approved exemptions for aircraft without fully functional
dual controls. See Exemption Nos.5778K and 9862A.

In Exemption No. 11109, the FAA ruled that this regulation does not apply if the operator does not
intend to conduct training that requires dual controls. Because Navigator does not intend to
conduct training that requires dual controls, this regulation does not apply and Navigator is,
therefore, not seeking relief from it.

E.4 14 CFR 91.203(a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and
       Registration

   The regulation provides in part:

     (a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within it the following:

          (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate. . . .

     (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by paragraph
          (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is displayed at the cabin
          or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

The sUAS fully loaded weighs no more than 10 lbs. and is operated without an onboard pilot.

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  18
Therefore, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or to
display them on the sUAS. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these
documents at the ground flight control point where the PIC/operator will have immediate access
to these documents.

The FAA has already addressed this matter on the memorandum titled "Interpretation regarding
whether certain required documents may be kept at an UA's control station" dated August 8, 2014. For
this reason, Navigator is not seeking relief from this regulation. Prior to the above referenced
memorandum, the FAA had issued numerous exemptions to this regulation (see Exemption Nos.
9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700).

F. PRIVACY

All of Navigator's sUA flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the prior
consent and knowledge of the property owner or the authority having jurisdiction. Images taken
will be of individuals who have consented to being filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the
area where aerial imagery will take place.

G. SUMMARY FOR PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER

   Pursuant to 14 CFR 11, Navigator provides the following summary for publication in the
   Federal Register, should the FAA determine that publication is needed.

***********************************************************************************************************************
In accordance with 14 CFR Part 11 and Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 (the 2012 Reform Act) Navigator CS,
LLC seeks relief from the following rules:

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H; 14 CFR 61.113 (a) and (b); 14 CFR 91.7(a); 14 CFR 91.103(b); 14 CFR 91.119(c); 14
CFR 91.121; 14 CFR 91.151(a)(1); 14 CFR 91.405(a); 14 CFR 91.407(a)(1); 14 CFR 91.409 (a)(1) and (2); 14 CFR
91.417 (a) and (b);

Approval of this petition will allow petitioner to safely, efficiently, and economically operate commercially a
small unmanned aircraft (sUA) weighing less than 10 lbs, to obtain aerial imaging in support of engineering surveys
of construction sites, existing buildings and facilities, and other sites, for the purpose of monitoring and ensuring site
safety, proper material usage, quality of workmanship and/ or to inspect the integrity of buildings and/or structures,
including but not limited to bridges, dams and others.

Conventional operations in this industry using rotorcraft or fixed-wing aircraft present the risks associated
with vehicles that weigh several thousand pounds and carry large amounts of fuel. Such aircraft must fly
to and from the survey or inspection site and operate at low altitudes. In contrast, the sUA weighs less
than 10 lbs., is powered by batteries, is transported (not flown) to the designated site, and carries no
passengers or crew. These features eliminate virtually all risks posed by manned aircraft flights for this
purpose.

The operation of a sUA weighing less than 10 pounds provides an equivalent level of safety and thus
supports the grant of the exemptions requested herein, including exempting the applicant from the
requirements of part 21 and allowing commercial operations. These light sUAS operate a slow speed,
close to the ground, and in a sterile environment. As a result, they are safer than conventional aerial
survey and inspection operations conducted with fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters.

***********************************************************************************************************************

Navigator CS, LLC - Petition for Exemption  19
H. CONCLUSION

As detailed in this document and attachments, the requested exemption will permit the commercial
operation of sUAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is limited, predetermined and accessed-
controlled, and would provide safety enhancements to the already best practices and safety protocols
followed by Navigator in the conduct of surveys and inspections at construction and other sites.
Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's
(the FAA Administrator's) responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such
aircraft systems in the national airspace system."

The small size and light weight of the Inspire 1, its operating capabilities, the restricted and sterile
environment within which Navigator will operate it, the provisions in Table 3 that Navigator is
committed to maintain, and "Navigator CS, LLC's Pre-Flight Checklist for Small Unmanned Aircraft
Systems (sUAS) Used in Commercial Operations" contained in Attachment A, which will be used by
Navigator for all commercial operations, Navigator's proposed sUAS operations fall within the zone of
safety (an equivalent level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption,
allow commercial operations of sUAS to commence immediately. In addition, as discussed in Section
B.2 of this petition, approval of this petition presents no threat to national security.

Given the clear direction in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95, the authority contained in the Federal
Aviation Act, as amended, the strong equivalent level of safetysurrounding the proposed operations,
and the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, FAA's granting of the requested
exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly, Navigator respectfully requests that the FAA grant the
requested exemptions without delay.
