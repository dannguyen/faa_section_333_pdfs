                                                           Exemption No. 12697
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2417

Mr. Django Greenblatt-Seay
5521 North 52nd Street
Omaha, NE 68104

Dear Mr. Greenblatt-Seay:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters posted to the public docket June 22 and August 14, 2015, you petitioned the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) for an exemption. You requested to operate an unmanned
aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography, videography, cinematography,
inspections, precision agriculture, closed-set filming, search and rescue operations, and UAS
training1.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

1 The petitioner also requested authority to conduct UAS training. At this time, the FAA is unable to authorize
UAS operations for training until a further assessment is completed. When the FAA completes its review, we
will proceed accordingly and no further action will be required by the petitioner. However, the petitioner is
permitted to train its own pilot in commands and visual observers in accordance with condition no. 14 and the
other conditions and limitations in this exemption.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire 1,
DJI Spreading Wings S800, DJI Spreading Wings S900, DJI Spreading Wings S1000, DJI
Matrice 100, Cinestar 8, Altavian Nova F6500, Blade 350 QX3, AgEagle, 3D Robotics X8,
3D Robotics Iris, 3D Robotics Solo, SenseFly eBee, Yuneec Q500 Typhoon, DraganFlayer
X4-ES, Trimble UX5, and Microdrones MD4.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection2 and closed set motion picture and
filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described
by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

2 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                            3

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Django Greenblatt-Seay is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection and closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to the
conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Django Greenblatt-Seay is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
    DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire 1, DJI Spreading Wings S800, DJI Spreading Wings
    S900, DJI Spreading Wings S1000, DJI Matrice 100, Cinestar 8, Altavian Nova
    F6500, Blade 350 QX3, AgEagle, 3D Robotics X8, 3D Robotics Iris, 3D Robotics
    Solo, SenseFly eBee, Yuneec Q500 Typhoon, DraganFlayer X4-ES, Trimble UX5,
    and Microdrones MD4 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
    Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
    amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.
                                                                                                            4

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.
                                                                                                            5

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
                                                                                         6

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.
                                                                                               7

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be

    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions

    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;

Enclosures
Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing pursuant to the FAA Modernization and
Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act) and the
procedures contained in 14 C.F.R. 11, to request that I,
an owner and operator of small unmanned aircraft, be
exempted under Section 333, so I may operate my
small unmanned aircraft commercially in airspace
regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

I am requesting this exemption because - (1) existing
regulations will severely hinder and burden me - (2) I
can provide and execute a level of competence and
safety that is, at the very least, equal to (or greater than
in many cases) to those provided by existing
guidelines, and (3) the request is in the public interest
and local benefit.

I am a career corporate communicator and
independent/freelance videographer. I have a day job
at Union Pacific Railroad as the company's
Communication Manager of Video, where I facilitate a
process that makes sure company videos follow safety
rules and regulations. In my free time, I have made
more than 130 music videos along with dozens of other
video projects. Many of these projects are commercial
projects.

I have been a sUAS hobbyist for about two years, with
more than 100 consecutive, safe flights with my DJI
Inspire 1 in the last year alone, with more than 100
hours of flight time. I conduct an extensive pre-flight
check before every flight. I conduct a safety briefing
prior to every flight, indicating the flight plan and
making sure everyone is aware of potential hazards in
our surroundings. The safety briefing is also an
opportunity to designate a person to call 911 in the
event of an emergency, and do determine whether
anyone on site is CPR certified.

Each flight is flown line of sight with a pilot (myself),
and a spotter. Most flights include a dedicated camera
operator as well. Maintaining line of sight is
accomplished by putting great effort into planning each
camera move/pass before initiating it.

I am formally requesting permission to fly my DJI
Inspire 1 commercially in the United States to capture
aerial cinematography for clients who would otherwise
have to contract a manned aerial vehicle, which would
put human life at a greater risk. Much of the
commercial cinematography I plan to conduct will be at
altitudes and in environments unsafe for a manned
vehicle. This includes low-altitude passes over
landscapes such as open farm land, or over wooded
areas.

My exemption request would permit me operation of my
DJI Inspire 1 in FAA approved airspace at a maximum
altitude of 300 feet and no greater than 50 miles per
hour. I will fly only in FAA approved areas, which
include appropriate distance from airports and other
no-fly-zone areas.

I will conduct my operations in compliance with the
protocols established by the FAA. For the reasons
stated in this petition, I respectfully request the grant of
an exemption allowing me to operate a DJI Inspire 1
within the national airspace system.

Details about my pre-flight checklist and specifications
about my DJI Inspire 1 are listed below.

Thank you,

INTRODUCTION AND INTERESTS OF THE PETITIONER

DearSirorMadam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the
"Reform Act") and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Django Greenblatt-Seay, ("Django Greenblatt-
Seay") Operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUASs") equipped to offer
on-demandcommercialUASoperationsforahostofindustriesandapplications and
to perform the purposes listed below, hereby applies for an exemption from the
listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of its
sUAV's/UAS, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the
conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA in an exemption
grantedundereitherSection333or Section49U.S.C.§44701(f)

As described more fully below, the requested exemption would permit the
operation of a UAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is 1) limited; 2)
predetermined;and3)wouldprovidesafetyenhancementsinthefieldsinwhichit
will operate, which now depend upon conventional aircraft or humans climbing
high on dangerous structures, walking in insect laden swamps, and working
adjacent to treacherous infrastructure. Approval of this exemption would thereby
enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA
Administrator's)responsibilitiesto"... establishrequirementsforthesafeoperation
of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system." Section 333(c) of the
ReformAct.1

Background

The Petitioner, Django Greenblatt-Seay is a highly accomplished, capable,
experiencedandtrustedprofessional.

Django Greenblatt-Seay is a career corporate communicator and
independent/freelance videographer. Django Greenblatt-Seay has a day job at a
major Railroad Company as the company's Communication Manager of Video,
where he facilitate a process that makes sure company videos follow safety rules
and regulations. In his free time, he has made more than 130 music videos along
withdozensofothervideoprojects.Manyoftheseprojectsarecommercialprojects.

Commitment to Safety

As part of its commitment to safety and innovation, Django Greenblatt-Seay is
askingforthis exemptioninpart,toreducetheriskofinjurytoitsemployeesand
contractors who participate in the proposed activities the petitioner requests,
including but not limited to damage to agriculture, natural habitat, buildings and
otherstructureswithintheUnited States.

Each flight is flown line of sight with a pilot (myself), and a spotter. Most flights
include a dedicated camera operator as well. Maintaining line of sight is
accomplished by putting great effort into planning each camera move/pass before
initiatingit.

Django Greenblatt-Seay is formally requesting permission to fly his DJI Inspire 1

The Exemption Request

Django Greenblatt-Seay proposes the use of the sUAV's will be for capture of high
resolution imagery and video of residential or commercial applications and
purposes to a level of quality that allows the Petitioner to use the imagery to
identify,record,memorializeeventsandobjectsaccordingtothepurposesnoted.

The imagery and video will be used to identify the condition of landscapes,
agriculture,events,disastersandinfrastructuretoconductbridgeinspections,flare

This exemption application is submitted to fulfill Congress' express goal in passing
Sections 333(a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of
Transportation to consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may
operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the
rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this
determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of UASs do not

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue
exemptions.This statutoryauthority,byitsterms,includesexemptingcivilaircraft,

Operator Requirements

Given the sUAV proposed by Django Greenblatt-Seay, Operators should not be
requiredtoholda privatepilotlicense.DjangoGreenblatt-Seay believesthat1)the
operator, instead of understanding how to operate a passenger carrying aircraft,
should have knowledge and experience that enables the safe operation of a small,
remotely piloted sUAV should understand airspace restrictions and know how to
ensureseparation fromotheraircraft aswell asnon-participants and property;2)
the sUAV has built-in technical capabilities that limit the potential for unsafe
operation and 3) there are other security screening mechanisms already in
existencethatDjangoGreenblatt-Seay will utilizetoensuretheoperatorsareacting
consistentlywithnationalsecurityinterests.

Given the sUAV safety features outlined below, Django Greenblatt-Seay proposes
that its operationsunderthisExemption requestshouldnot be requiredto hold a
commercialorprivate pilotcertification.Instead,Operatorsshouldberequiredto:
have successfully completed, at a minimum, FAA private pilot ground instruction
and passed the FAA Private Pilot written examination or FAA-recognized
equivalents; have completed Django Greenblatt-Seay' training program for
operationoftheUAS.

Django Greenblatt-Seay notes that 1) the FAA has found that safety factors
permitted operation of sUAV's by Operators with these qualifications in the case of
operations pursuant to public COAs when the mandatory operating conditions
specified above were present; and 2) that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
entitled Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 80 F.R.
9544(February23,2015)("NPRM"),doesnotrequiretheoperatortoholda private
pilotlicenseorathirdclassmedical.

    maximumof400feet AGL.

See Federal Aviation Administration, Notice N-8900.227, Unmanned Aircraft
Systems (UAS) Operational Approval, at 20-21 (July 30, 2013); As the FAA has
determinedinExemptions11062thru11067,11080and11110(the "Exemptions"),
in comparing the requirements for private pilot knowledge and the knowledge
required for a commercial pilot, that knowledge associated with a private pilot
license, and therefore private pilot ground school, was sufficient to allow private
pilotstooperatesUAV's underthoseexemptions.

Baseduponthatanalysis,DjangoGreenblatt-Seay believessuccessful completionof
FAAprivatepilotgroundschoolisasuitable predicatetooperatingthesUAVunder
this exemption. Django Greenblatt-Seay proposes that the Operator accumulate
required sUAV flight training hours through the operation of sUAV's rather than
flight hours in conventional aircraft. Those hours are more relevant to the
operations proposed herein than hours gained in obtaining a private pilot's
certificate in conventional or rotor aircraft. Those aircraft are orders of magnitude
heavierthanthesUASandcarrynotonlythepilothimself,butalsopassengersand
fuel, none of which is carried in the sUAS. These conventional aircraft fly over all
sortsofairspacewithout thepermissionorknowledgeofthelandowner.

AhandheldradiocontrollercontrolsthesUAV andthevehicleisoperatedwithinthe
line of sight. The requirements of Part 61.127 (commercial flight proficiency) and
§61.107 (private flight proficiency), to the extent they are relevant to UAS
operations, can be taught in the training proposed herein. As a review of the
requirements of part 61.127 and 107 demonstrate, the issues presented as they
relate to a 55 pound aircraft, operating at less than 30 mph during filming
operations are those taught in ground school and in flight training with the
particular UAS and not gained from accumulating flight hours in a fixed wing or
rotorcraft gas or jet A powered aircraft completing cross country flights and take
offsandlandingsatcontrolledanduncontrolledairports.

As to national security review of pilots, each of Django Greenblatt-Seay'
pilots/operators will obtain internally provided certified training (Ground and
Practical) from Django Greenblatt-Seay to operate the sUAV. This review and
certification could reasonably vetthe Operatorsagainst any known terroristorno
flylistingsthatarerelevant andpublicallyavailable.

DjangoGreenblatt-Seay additionallyasksthatthe exemptionbeissuedwithoutthe

Django Greenblatt-Seay again notes that the NPRM does not require the use of a
visual observer. Given the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act; the
authoritycontainedinthe FederalAviationAct,asamended;thestrongequivalent
level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and the significant public
benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental impacts, including
reduced emissions associated with allowing battery powered sUAV's for these
functions instead of turbine or gas power aircraft/rotorcraft and operations with
pilotshavingatleastaprivatepilotlicense,thegrantoftherequestedexemptionsis
inthe publicinterest.6


6 Should the FAA determine that it cannot grant suchan exemption foroperations
without a FAA licensed private pilot, despite the showing made herein, under the
statutory authority the FAA already has, Django Greenblatt-Seay will operate its
aircraft with pilots holding at least a private pilot certificate issuedby the FAA. In
that event, Django Greenblatt-Seay requests that the exemption be granted with
conditions similar to those contained in numbered paragraphs 14-15 in Exemption
11136

Django Greenblatt-Seay respectfully proposes that Operator requirements should
takeintoaccountthe characteristicsoftheparticularUAS.DjangoGreenblatt-Seay'
sUAV has a high degree of pre-programmed control and various built-in technical
capabilities that strictly limit the potential for operation outside of the operating
conditionssetforthintheexemptionapplication. TheDjangoGreenblatt-Seay' sUAV
hasnavigationandcontrolsystemcomprisedofaGroundControlStation (GCS)and
auto-pilot system that can be pre-programmed to set operational boundaries. All
flights are pre-programmed with precision GPS guidance.. In the case of unplanned
events, the Operator may input pre-programmed evasive maneuvers from the
controlunit,andtheonboardautopilotexecutesthosemaneuvers. Pre-programmed
Operatorinterventionsincludeinitiationofholdingatpresentposition; suspension

Additional automated safety functions and safety enhancing features of the Django
Greenblatt-Seay' sUAV's mayincludethe following:

          1.1. Auto-pilot detection of lost GPS or of insufficient satellites initiates an

Giventhesesafetyfeatures,DjangoGreenblatt-Seay proposesthatOperatorsofthe
Django Greenblatt-Seay' sUAV should not be required to hold a commercial or
privatepilotcertification.

Instead, Operators should be required to: have successfully completed, at a
minimum, FAA private pilot ground instruction and passed the FAA Private Pilot
written examination or FAA-recognized equivalents; have completed the
manufacturer's or Django Greenblatt-Seay' training program for operation of the
UAS.

DjangoGreenblatt-Seay notesthattheFAAhasfoundthatsafetyfactors permitted
operation ofUASsby Operatorswith thesequalifications inthe caseofoperations
pursuanttopublicCOAswherethe mandatoryoperatingconditionsspecifiedabove
werepresent.See,FederalAviation Administration,NoticeN-8900.227,Unmanned
Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operational Approval, at 20-21 (July 30, 2013). Likewise,
Django Greenblatt-Seay notes that the NPRM does not require that the Operator
holdaprivatepilotlicenseissuedbytheFAA.

Given these conditions and restrictions, an equivalent level of safety will be
provided by allowing operation of the Django Greenblatt-Seay' sUAV without a
privatepilot'scertificateoracommercialpilot's certificate,undertheconditionsset
forthherein.

TherisksassociatedwiththeoperationoftheDjangoGreenblatt-Seay' sUAV (given
its size, speed, operational capabilities, and lack of combustible fuel) are so
diminished from the level of risk associated with private pilot operations or
commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 with conventional aircraft (fixed

14 C.F.R. §91.119: Minimum safe altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section
91.119(d)allowshelicopterstobeoperatedatlessthantheminimumsprescribed,
providedthe person operating thehelicoptercomplies with any routeoraltitudes
prescribed for helicopters by the FAA. As this exemption is for a sUAS that is a
helicopter and the exemption requests authority to operate at altitudes up to 400
AGL,anexemptionmaybeneededtoallowsuchoperations.

far less than those presently presented by conventional aircraft operating at or
below 500 AGL in the aerial photography industry. In addition, the low-altitude
operations of the sUAS will ensure separation between these small-UAS operations
and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.
The FAA has granted exemptions to conduct similar operations in Exemptions
11062through11067,11080and 11110.

14 C.F.R. §91.121 Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising
altitude by reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure
airport or an appropriate altimeter setting available before departure." As the
Django Greenblatt-Seay' sUAV, in manual or emergency mode, will not have a
barometricaltimeter display,butinstead a GPSaltitude display,an exemption will
be needed. The Operator, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Manuals as
indicated before flight, will achieve an equivalent level of safety. The FAA has
granted exemptions to conduct similar operations in Exemptions 11062 through
11067,11080 and11110.

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

Section 91.151(a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane
under VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions)
there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming
normalcruisingspeed­ (1)Duringthe day,toflyafter thatforatleast30minutes;
or(2)Atnight,toflyafterthatforatleast45 minutes."

Petitioner believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting
flightsto 30minutesor25%ofremainingbatterypowerwhicheverhappensfirst.
This restriction would be more than adequate to return the sUAS to its planned

Given that these sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to the Petitioner. Maintenance will be
accomplished by the Operator or manufacturer pursuant to the flight manual and
