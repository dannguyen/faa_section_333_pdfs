                                                      Exemption No. 11160B
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0785

Mr. Jack Snyder
Helinet Aviation Services, LLC
16303 Waterman Drive
Van Nuys, CA 91406

Dear Mr. Snyder:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 14, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Helinet Aviation Services LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection1 and closed-set motion picture and television filming. You requested an amendment
to add the DJI Inspire 1.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

1Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11160
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11160 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Gryphon
         Dynamics X8, DJI S1000, and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds
         including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
         petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on February 28, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

          Re. Petition to Amend FAA Exemption No. 11160 (the "Exemption")

Dear Sir or Madam:

Helinet Aviation Services, LLC, hereby requests approval to amend the Exemption to permit Helinet to
operate an additional model of UAS ­ the DJI Inspire 1. The FAA has previously authorized use of the DJI
Inspire for commercial purposes on multiple occasions (e.g., Exemption Nos. 11318, 11447, 11458, 11461,
and 11463).

On February 2, 2015, the FAA issued the Exemption to Helinet to utilize the DJI S1000 and Gryphon
Dynamics X8 UAS for motion picture and television filming.

Helinet's amended Flight Operations and Procedures Manual (FOPM) is being submitted separately
pursuant to 14 CFR §11.35(b). Section 6 (pages 5-6 and 11-12) of the FOPM contains the proposed
amendment.

All UAS operations will continue to fully adhere to the conditions of the Exemption and all operations will be
in full compliance with the terms of the Exemption.

Thank you for your consideration of our request.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at 818.902.0229.

Sincerely yours,

Jack Snyder

Vice President and General Counsel
