                                                           Exemption No. 13049
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2785

Mr. Lane Swainston
President
Swainston Digital Imaging
1542 Little Dove Court
Henderson, NV 89014

Dear Mr. Swainston:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 29, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Swainston Digital Imaging (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
imaging, safety surveys, forensic inspections, and law enforcement support.

See the docket, at www.regulations.gov, for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the
proposed operations and the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Swainston Digital Imaging is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Swainston Digital Imaging is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire when
         weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
         aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the enclosed COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards

Re: Exemption Request Section 333 ofthe FAA Reform Act and Part 11 ofthe Federal Aviation
Regulations from 14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b); 91.103(b); 91.119;91.121; 9.151(a); 91.405 (a) (1);
91.409 (a) (2); 91.417 (a) & (b).

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 ofthe FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012 (the Reform Act)
and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Swainston Digital Imaging (SDI), an aerial photography and digital
imaging company, on behalf of itself and its related affiliates under common ownership and
control, hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs")
to allow commercial operation of its Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUAS") for aerial
imaging for video, still photography, forensic inspections, safety surveys, and law enforcement
support, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined
herein or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333.

As detailed in this document and the attached Flight Manual, the requested exemption would
permit the operation of sUAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is 1) limited 2)
predetermined 3) controlled and 4) would provide safety enhancements to the already best
practices safety protocols followed by SDI during aerial photography and inspection operations.
SDI is a member of the "Professional Aerial Photographers Association, International" (PAPA)
and has a longstanding demonstrated record of safe operations in the National Airspace System
(NAS). Principal employees have received Private Pilot ground school training and each have
logged well over 25 hours of sUAS flight operations. Approval of this exemption would thereby
enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's)
responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the
National Airspace System." Section 333(c) of the Reform Act.

I. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR EXEMPTIONS

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA authority to issue exemptions. This statutory
authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under §40 101 of the Act,
including sUASs, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current airworthiness
certificate.

The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under
subsection (a) or (b) ofthis section or any sections 44702-44716 ofthis title ifthe Administrator
finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. §44701(f) See also 49 USC §44711(a); 49
USC §44704; 14 CFR §91.203(a) (1).

Section 333(b) of the Reform Act assists the Secretary in determining whether sUAS may
operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) without creating a hazard to the user, the public,
or a threat to national security. In making this determination, the Secretary must consider:

              · The sUAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
              · Whether the sUAS operates within the visual line of sight of the operator

Swainston Digital Imaging
                                                                                                                3

              + Whether the sUAS operates outside of highly populated areas and away from
                   close proximity to airports

Reform Act §333(a). If the Secretary determines that a sUAS "may operate safely in the national
airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
in the national airspace system." !d. §333(c)

SDI's sUAS are multirotor vehicles, weighing 20 or fewer lbs. including payload. They operate
under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 70 knots and have the capability to hover,
and move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously. The sUAS will operate only in the
PIC and Visual Observers visual line of sight at all times and will operate only within the
designated area described in the Confidential SDI Flight Manual, attached as Exhibit 1
(hereinafter "the Manual"). Such operations will insure that the sUAS will "not create a hazard to
users ofthe national airspace system or the public." Reform Act Section 333 (b).

Given the small size of the sUAS involved and the restricted and controlled environment within
which they will operate, our application falls squarely within the zone of safety (an equivalent
level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption, allow
commercial operations of sUAS to commence immediately. Also, due to the small size of the
sUAS, altitudes, and restricted areas in which the sUAS will operate, approval of the application
presents no national security issue.

Given the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal
Aviation Act, as amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed
operations, and the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, the grant of the
requested exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly, SDI respectfully requests that the
FAA grant the requested exemption without delay.

II. PUBLIC INTEREST

This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section
333(a) through (c) ofthe Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of Transportation to
consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the NAS before
completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. By granting an
exemption the FAA will fulfill Congress's intent of allowing UAS to operate with significant
safety precautions in low risk environments.

The use of sUAS on aerial photography operations can significantly reduce the risk to
photographers and participants. Also, sUAS can inspect, photograph, and collect data on hard to
get to areas that otherwise would require direct access or manned aircraft.

Additionally, sUAS could replace the use of helicopters and small aircraft to produce imagery
for various purposes. The sUAS we propose to fly in this application are less than 20 pounds,
and carry no combustible material on board, as opposed to the much larger conventionally
powered small aircraft. Shifting to sUAS from helicopters and other manned aircraft presents a
marked safety increase for our workers and the public.

                                                                                                                   4

Lastly, sUAS reduce the environmental impact by dramatically decreasing the energy used for
aerial imaging and data collection. The sUAS used by SDI use rechargeable lithium ion batteries,
as opposed to fossil fuels burned in operation of small aircraft that are many hundreds of times
heavier.

III. EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

SDI proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to sUAS that have the characteristics
and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at least an
equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory structure
because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to the already safe protocols
followed on imaging, photography, safety surveys, forensic inspection, and law enforcement
support operations conducted with helicopters and other conventional aircraft.

SDI will be bound by the following limitations when conducting its sUAS operations under an
FAA issued exemption:

1. The sUAS will be less than 20 pounds.
2. Flights will be operated within visual line of sight of a Pilot in Command.
3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 20 minutes. The Pilot in

    Command calculates battery reserve, and will return the sUAS to the "Designated Safety
    Zone" with at least 20% battery power reserve should that occur prior to the 20 minute limit.
4. Flights will normally be operated at an altitude of not more than 400 feet AGL, never
    exceeding 1200 feet AGL.
5. Crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS Pilot in Command (PIC) who will keep the
    sUAS within his visual line of sight at all times and will be supported by a qualified Visual
    Observer (VO).
6. The sUAS operator will be trained in flight operations, and safety procedures as detailed in
    the Flight Manual.
7. The sUAS will only operate within a confined "Area of Operations" (AO) as defined in the
    Manual. The Manual also requires the establishment of a "Designated Safety Zone" (Safety
    Zone) for the preparation, takeoff, and landing flight operations area.
8. A briefing will be conducted regarding the planned sUAS operations prior to each day's
    production activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties
    within the boundaries of the Safety Zone be present for this briefing.
9. All onsite personnel will consent to the UAS flyover on site by waiver, and the operator will
    obtain additional verbal or written consent of all persons who will be allowed within 100 feet
    of the flight AO.
10. Pilot in Command will have been trained in operation ofUAS generally and will have
    received up-to-date information on the particular sUAS to be operated as required by the SDI
    Manual.
11. Necessary written and/or oral permission from the relevant property holders will be obtained.

                                         Swainston Digital Imaging
                                                                                                                5

12. All necessary permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county, or city
    jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate government agencies
    as may be required.

13. If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will have the capability to enter
    "loiter mode" and hover, reestablish satellite connection, and return to a predetermined
    location within the "Designated Safety Zone" and land.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command

Sections 61.113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the sUAS
will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent level of
safety of current operations by requiring the Pilot in Command operating the aircraft to have
completed a sUAS flight training course of25 hours before flying a sUAS (See the SDI Manual
for details). Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the sUAS is
remotely controlled with no living thing or cargo on board. The area of operation is controlled
and restricted per prior planning and necessary coordination with the local FSDO if applicable,
and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance as required and as set forth in the SDI
Flight Manual.

The sUAS to be operated hereunder is less than 20 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a pilot nor
passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exclusively
within a controlled Area of Operation as set out in the SDI Flight Manual. Like other civil
aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by the Pilot in
Command, pursuant to the SDI Flight Manual requirements, and under the requirements and in
compliance with local public safety requirements, to provide security for the Area of Operation
as is currently done by SDI on normal aerial photography operations. The FAA will have
advance notice of all operations as may be required.

The risks associated with the operation of the sUAS are therefore diminished from the level of
risk associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, and allowing
operations of the sUAS as requested with an operator who has met the minimum requirements
stated in the SDI Manual achieves the level of safety contemplated by 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) &
(b).

14 C.F.R. 91.103: Preflight Action

This regulation requires each Pilot in Command take certain actions before flight to ensure the
safety of flight. An exemption is needed from this requirement as the PIC will take separate
preflight actions, including checking for weather conditions, checking flight battery requirements,
checking takeoff and landing distances, and all other actions in the Preflight Checklist in the SDI
Manual. These actions will provide an equivalent level of safety.

                                        Swainston Digital Imaging
                                                                                                                   6

14 C.F. R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119 (d) allows
helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person operating
the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the FAA. This
exemption is for a multirotor craft that flies similarly to a helicopter, with vertical takeoff and
vertical landing, which will typically operate at altitudes of less than 400 AGL, so an exemption
may be needed to allow such operations. The sUAS will never operate at altitude higher than
1200 AGL and will be in a controlled area with a "Designated Safety Zone", where buildings and
people will not be exposed to operations without the specified pre-obtained consent. (See SDI
Manual for detailed procedures.)

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the sUAS as well
as the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the required permission of
the property owner or local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property owner and
any onsite personnel as outlined in the SDI Flight Manual, all affected individuals will be aware
of the planned flight operations. Unlike flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far
more than the maximum 20 lbs. proposed herein, our sUAS will not carry flammable fuel. In
addition, the coordinated operations of the sUAS will ensure separation between sUAS
operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.

14 C.F.R. 91.121: Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the sUAS may not have a barometric altimeter,
but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety
will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the SDI Flight Manual and Safety Check list,
confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR 91.151 (a): Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

Section 91.151 (a) outlines fuel requirements for beginning a flight in VFR conditions. Our
sUAS is limited to operations in controlled environments as outlined in the SDI Flight Manual,
and has a limited range and flight time which require an exemption from 14 CFR 91.151 (a)

The battery powering the sUAS provides over 20 minutes of powered flight. To meet the 30
minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR §91.151, sUAS flights would necessarily be limited to a
few minutes in length. Given the limitations on the sUAS's proposed flight area and the location
of its proposed operations within a predetermined area, a longer time frame for flight in daylight
or night VFR conditions is reasonable.

SDI believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) falls within the scope of prior
exemptions. See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate without
compliance with FAR 91.151(a)). Operating the small sUAS, in a controlled area where only
people and property owners or official representatives who have signed waivers will be allowed,

                                         Swainston Digital Imaging
                                                                                                                  7

with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel, does not engender the type of risks that Section
91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed ofthe small UAS. Additionally,
limiting sUAS flights to a few minutes would greatly reduce the utility for which the exemption
will be granted.

An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to approximately 20 minutes, or
enough battery reserve to ensure that the sUAS lands at the ground station with at least 20% of
battery power (as determined by the onboard monitoring system and the PIC), whichever
happens first. This restriction would be more than adequate to return the sUAS to its planned
landing zone from anywhere in its limited operating area.

Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689F, 5745,
10673, and 10808.

14 CFR 91.405 (a); 407 (a)(1); 409 (a)(2); 417 (a) & (b): Maintenance inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in the subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of
this chapter. ..," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

Given that these sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate,
these sections will not apply to SDI. Maintenance will be accomplished by the Operator and
pursuant to the flight manual and operating handbook as referenced in the SDI Flight Manual.
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because these small sUAS are very limited in size
and will carry a small payload and operate only in controlled areas for limited periods of time. If
mechanical issues arise, the sUAS can land immediately and will be typically operating from 400
AGL or less and no higher than 1200 feet AGL. As provided in the SDI Flight Manual, the PIC
will ensure that the sUAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform required
maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the PIC is the person
most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to
provide the equivalent level of safety.

                                              *********

Pursuant to C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal
Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules: 14 C.F.R. § 21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R.
45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113(a) & (b); 91.7

(a); 91.9 (b) (2); 91.103(b); 91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a) and (b); 91.405 (a);
91.407 (a) (1); 91.409 (a) (2) and 91.417 (a) & (b) to operate commercially a small unmanned
vehicle (55lbs or less) in aerial photography operations.

                                        Swainston Digital Imaging
                                                                                                                    8

  Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUAS in the aerial photography,
  safety surveys, forensic inspection, law enforcement support, and video industries enhances
  safety while reducing risk. Manned aircraft still photography, forensic inspection, law
  enforcement support and video creates a greater risk because the aircraft are much larger, have
  combustible fuel, and carry an onboard human crew. In contrast, a sUAS weighing fewer than
  20 lbs. and powered by batteries eliminates virtually all of that risk, given the reduced mass and
  lack of combustible fuel carried on board. The sUAS will carry no passengers or crew and,
  therefore, will not expose them to the risks associated with manned aircraft flights.

  The operation of small sUAS, weighing less than 20 lbs., conducted in the strict conditions
  outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exemptions
  requested herein, including exempting the applicant from the requirements of Part 21 and
  allowing commercial operations. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to the
  ground, and in a controlled environment and, as a result, are far safer than conventional
  operations conducted with turbine or reciprocating helicopters or full scale manned aircraft
  operating in close proximity to the ground and people.

  Privacy

  All flights will occur over private or public property with the necessary private property owner's
  prior consent and knowledge. Images taken will be of individuals who have also consented to
  being filmed or otherwise having agreed to be in the area where aerial photography, safety
  surveys, or forensic inspections will take place.

                                                  *********

  Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of2012--size, weight,
  speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation within
  visual line of sight and national security -provide more than adequate justification for the grant
  of the requested exemptions allowing commercial operation of applicant's sUAS in construction
  industry pursuant to the SDI Manuf!.l appended hereto.

            PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND MISSION STATEMENT

Swainston Digital Imaging (SDI), a member of the Professional Aerial
Photographers Association, International (PAPA} intends as the Operator to
promote safe operation of sUAS in the National Airspace System (NAS} in a
manner that is consistent with a long history of safe and professional flight
operations in close cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The Operators are experienced professional aerial photographers and have
completed private pilot ground school for rotary wing aircraft as well as
approximately 40 hours of instructor supervised flight time. The sUAS Pilots in
Command (PIC} that will operate systems according to the approach outlined in
this Flight Manual of procedures (Manual) are trained in accordance with this
Manual and have received at least 25 hours of UAS training combined with
experience on conventional Aerial Photographic flight missions.
The intent of the Manual is to provide the outline of a system to conduct safe and
successful sUAS operations in accordance with the applicable FAA regulations and
consistent with the section 333 waiver that this Manual is based upon. It is
expected that the Operator will continue to apply the skills and experience they
have employed in manned aircraft operations under FAA regulations. This
combination of prior successful flight experience and sound sUAS flight
operational procedures is intended to promote the highest levels of
professionalism in safe aerial photographic flight missions.

                                                                        5

                       PERSONNEL RESPONSIBILITIES

VISUAL OBSERVER
All operations will utilize a Visual Observer. The main responsibilities of the Visual
Observer will be to ensure that the UA is operated within the visual line of sight of
both the PIC and Visual Observer at all times. The Visual Observer will maintain
verbal communication with the PIC at all times. Prior to flight, the PIC will ensure
that the Visual Observer understands and can perform all the duties required of
the Visual Observer.

PIC
Pilot in Command is responsible for the safe operation of the sUAS at all times in
accordance with this Manual and the applicable FAA regulations.

Pilot in Command will be responsible for:
    · All support personnel.
    · Performing all pre-flight, flight phase, and post flight inspections, air
         worthiness, diagnostics, and testing.
    · Manufacturer recommended maintenance operations.
    · Weather condition assessments and forecast reviews.

FLIGHT TEAM COMPOSITION
The onsite flight team is composed of a Pilot in Command (PIC} and a Visual
Observer (VO}. The PIC is responsible for all flight operations and decisions to
proceed. The VO is responsible to maintain visual contact with the UA and to
provide constant communication with the PIC regarding aircraft status and
surrounding conditions within the Area of Operations.

QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
The PIC must be a licensed Commercial Pilot and must have completed the PAPA
sponsored ground school with at least 25 hours of sUAS flight time. The VO must
have completed sUAS ground school training and must demonstrate experience
with FAA procedures and the standard procedures of this Manual.

                                                                     8
              OPERATING LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS

Operational Ceiling- Maximum 1,200 ft AGL, typical400 ft AGL.
Operational Endurance- approximately 20 minutes.
Maximum Speed- 100 MPH
Maximum Operating Temperature- 110 degrees F
Minimum Operating Temperature - 0 degrees F
Maximum Operational Wind Speed- 15 MPH (gusts to 20 MPH)

                                                                           9
                        MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

Only SDI personnel or an appointed service technician may carry out maintenance
on the sUAS aircraft systems described in this operations manual. In all cases a
Maintenance Logbook (see Appendix B) is completed to reflect any work
undertaken and a flight test, testing all functions (including the return-to-home
failsafe facility), is subsequently carried out by the PIC.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE
The Pre-Flight and Post-Flight checklists shown in Appendix A are completed by
the PIC every time a SDI sUAS aircraft is operated. Every six months (or fifty hours
of flight time- whichever comes first) the following inspection is carried out by
the PIC. The inspection is recorded in the Maintenance Logbook along with any
findings. Any issues identified are remedied and the aircraft undergoes a full
flight-test before the aircraft is returned to Operational Status:

    · Inspection of the airframe for any damage, unusual marks and tightness of
        fixings;

    · Inspection of the motor mountings for correct tension;
    · Inspection of the propellers for condition, unusual marks, chips, cracks and

        tightness of fasteners;
    · Inspection of electrical wiring for condition, unusual marks or discoloration;
    · Inspection of electrical terminal fittings and plugs for secure attachment

         and general condition;
    · Inspection of the attachment of all fittings such as flight controller, GPS

         antennas etc. for secure attachment;
    · Inspection of payload attachment points for condition and security of

         payload;
    · Inspection of the condition and function of all ancillary equipment such as

        transmitter etc.
    · Testing of all system battery packs for charge status and general condition.

If any issues or problems are identified then the aircraft is not allowed to fly until
the issue has been remedied. If minor problems (such as damaged propellers,
faulty battery packs etc.) are identified and remedied, and the PIC believes the
aircraft is suitable to return to Operational Status then the work completed is
noted in the Maintenance Logbook. If major issues are identified (such as an
unserviceable motor, damaged airframe etc.}, then the aircraft undergoes a full

                                                              10
flight test regime (as described below), once the identified fault has been
remedied.

FULL FLIGHT TEST
The system has all functions tested with a minimum of five minutes flight time by
a qualified PIC recording any abnormalities in the Flight Record Logbook
(Appendix D). If the PIC deems the aircraft to be safe then he must sign the Flight
Record Logbook as fit for Operational use. Systems with identified issues relating
to firmware or software (see below) are grounded by SDI until any problems are
rectified.

SOFTWARE AND FIRMWARE UPDATE POLICY
All new software and firmware are thoroughly assessed before installation.
Particular attention is focused on relevance to operations, reason for release and
any known issues. Multi-rotor and UAS forums are consulted regularly for any
reported issues with the release and only when the validity of the upgrade has
been confirmed is the upgrade considered.

In all circumstances the upgrade is performed by qualified SDI personnel or
appointed service providers. All upgrade information such as version numbers
and new functions are recorded in the Maintenance Logbook. All SDI PIC are
made aware that the firmware or software has been upgraded before any flight
operations are undertaken.

Any upgraded system has all functions thoroughly tested with a minimum of five
minutes flight time by a qualified SDI PIC who records any abnormalities in the
Flight Record Logbook. If the PIC deems the aircraft to be safe then the PIC signs
the Flight Record Logbook as fit for Operational use. If any doubts exist as to the
new upgrade the aircraft is downgraded to the previous firmware and the flight
test procedure is repeated. Systems with identified issues relating to firmware or
software are grounded until the problem can be rectified.

                                                                       11
                              LOGS AND RECORDS

PILOT AND AIRCRAFT HOURS
SDI PIC are required to keep a log of pilot and aircraft hours.
To meet this requirement SDI holds and updates a spreadsheet-based Personal
Flying Log Book for Aircraft Operating Crew. This log book is a separate document
which can be viewed on request (see sample page at Appendix D).
BATTERY LOGBOOK
SDI Personal Flying Log Book (Appendix D) additionally records information about
battery condition (charge) before and after each flight. The Battery Logbook is
accompanied by- and supported with- SDIIncident Logbook (Appendix C) and
Maintenance Logbook (Appendix B).

                                                               12
                                FLIGHT PLANNING

WEATHER
Operator will require PIC to obtain all necessary weather information in order to
plan and conduct safe flight operations according to and as referenced by any
applicable UA Operator Manuals. If operating near an operating Automatic
Terminal Information Service {ATIS), the ATIS broadcast system will be consulted.
If ATIS is not available, PIC will consult-alternative sources for a current weather
forecast.

The operating envelope for the Inspire has been referred to earlier. It is
emphasized that the PIC is to ensure the operating envelope environment meets
or exceeds all safe and legal visibility, precipitation, humidity, and wind limitations
for safe operation.

SITE PERMISSIONS
    · Secure permissions from property owner if required.
    · Secure permissions from participants.
    · Coordinate with local law enforcement if required.
    · Prior to operations, Operator receives permission for take-off and landing
        from the relevant land-owner. In most cases permission attainment is
        unproblematic as the landowner and the client are the same individual (or
        entity). In the case of local authority owned land, the relevant authority is
        contacted in advance to secure permission for take-off and landing, and to
        find out about any operating restrictions or specific insurance requirements
        that might apply.

PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTIONS AND CHECKS
Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine if
the UAS is in a condition for safe flight, and to account for all possible
discrepancies or inoperable equipment. If the inspection reveals any condition
that will affect the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft will be prohibited from
operating until the necessary maintenance can be performed and the UAS can be
returned to safe flight. The preflight inspections will include the following
components according to the recommended checklists in the DJI Inspire operator
manual, and in the SDI checklist:

                                                                    13
   D Airframe
   D Battery
   D Transmitters
    D Camera and Gimbal
    D Propulsion system including propellers

In addition, with the battery attached and turned on in the UAS, the PIC will
oversee and monitor the series of diagnostic tests to determine and verify proper
voltage levels, control function, communication, and GPS satellite connectivity
acquisition. PIC will utilize the DJI Inspire LED indicators as well as telemetry data
to determine if the proper preflight diagnostics have been completed. The PIC
will also perform and log a pre-flight compass calibration each time the UAS is
flown from a new location.

DOCUMENTATION
PIC will ensure that all documents used by SDI to ensure safe flight operations and
any document required under 14 CFR 91.9 and 91.203 must be available at the
Ground Control Station on site at any time the UAV is operating, and ready to be
made available to any law enforcement official upon request. If possible, these
documents will be on the PIC's person at all times during flight operations, and
accessible to law enforcement without interrupting the PIC while conducting
flight operations (possibly in a pouch on the back of the vest).

PRE-FLIGHT AREA AND PERSONNEL CHECKS
    · Survey flight operations area for safety concerns and to verify conditions.
    · Examine all components of the UAS to verify proper function in accordance
         with the applicable manuals and manufacturer's instructions.
    · Verify notification to all personnel on site.
    · Establish Designated Safety Zone and verify safe clearances.
    · PIC should wear the specified safety vest.
    · The ultimate responsibility for aircraft airworthiness and operational safety
         rests with the UAV pilot-in-command. For this, the PIC- as an aid- uses a
         Pre-Flight Checklist (see Appendix A). In summary, the Pre-Flight Checklist
         prompts examination of the following:

                   D The airframe (for condition and lack of damage);
                    D The battery (for level-of-charge and security of attachment);

                  D The transmitter (for level-of-charge and to check that switches

                                                              14
                          are in the 'home' position);

                  D The camera (secured, on and operating).
                   D Propulsion system

    · In addition, when the flight battery is connected to the UAV, the flight
        controller undertakes a series of diagnostic tests (while simultaneously
         locating the position of GPS satellites).

CLOSED SET OPERATIONS
If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture
and television filming and production, the following additional conditions and
limitations apply:

    · The operator must have a Motion Picture and Television Operations
         Manual {MPTOM) as documented in this grant of exemption.

    · At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by
        this exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight
        Standards District Office {FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed
        filming. The 3-day notification may be waived with the concurrence of the
         FSDO. The plan of activities must include at least the following:
                      o Dates and times for all flights;
                      o Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial
                          filming conducted under this grant of exemption;
                      o Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-
                          scene operation of the UAS;
                      o Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
                      o Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial
                          filming;
                      o A statement that the operator has obtained permission from
                           property owners and/or local officials to conduct the filming
                           production event; the list of those who gave permission must
                           be made available to the inspector upon request;
                      o Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
                      o A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams
                           of any area, city, town, county, and/or state over which filming
                          will be conducted and the altitudes essential to accomplish the
                           operation.

    · Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating

                                                               15
        persons consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production,
        as specified in the exemption holder's MPTOM.

ON-SITE PROCEDURES

The on-site procedures undertaken by SDI are conducted in accordance with and
controlled through an extensive use ofchecklists. For this reason the following
sections repeatedly refer to various checklists found in AppendixA ofthis Manual.

    · Site Survey- In advance of operations, a survey is undertaken to review the
        site, its terrain, structures and surroundings- to check any assumptions
        made about the location prior to arrival and to adjust the operations plan
        accordingly. For this, an On-Site Survey Checklist is used (see Appendix A,
        page 25}. The primary purpose of the site survey is to make a visual check
        of the operating area with the objective of identifying any potential
        hazards.

    · Selection of Operating Areas and Alternatives- In advance of the pre-flight
        On-Site Survey, Google maps will be consulted and- if possible- the local
        site will be visited beforehand. The site will be specifically checked in terms
        of:
                      o Proximity to Airport Reference Points (ARP} as denoted in the
                          Airport Facility Directory (AFD}. Must operate outside 5 miles
                           of ARP, unless otherwise agreed upon by virtue of written
                           letter of agreement with the airport's management, or
                           otherwise permitted by the COA issued to Photographic
                           Solutions
                      o Ability of PIC and VO to operate the UAS clear of, and give way
                          to, all manned aviation operations and activities at all times.
                      o 500ft. clearance of all non-participating persons, vessels,
                          vehicles, and structures unless; A. sufficiently protected in the
                           event of an accident, and the nonparticipating persons remain
                         protected at all times during operations of the UAS, and B. The
                           owners and controllers of any vessels, vehicles, or structures
                           has granted permission for the operating closer to those
                           objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of the risk of
                           operating closer to those objects and determined that it does
                           not present an undue hazard.

                                                               16
                      o Ability of SDI to conduct operations over private or controlled
                          access property with permission from the owner/controller or
                          representative of such, and said permissions are granted.

                      o Proximity to radio interferences
                      o Prevailing weather conditions have been adequately assessed,

                          including; high winds, convection, visibility, minimum cloud
                          clearance {500ft below, and 2,000 ft horizontal clearance), or
                          when visibility is less than 3 miles from the PIC.

The primary site for take-off and landing will be assessed (size, shape, surface,
slope and surroundings) and an alternative site will be identified should the
primary site become unavailable or unsuitable.

    · Boundaries- SDI requires that proper identifiers and signage will be in
         place in the operating area to alert people to the fact that aerial work is
         being conducted. The PIC will be responsible for cordoning to ensure safe
        distances from operations are observed. Cordoning procedures to be
         practiced include:
                      o Take-off and Landing safety Area: PIC will determine the safe
                          distances of all people from the take-off and landing operation
                          of the UAS. The PIC will also establish a cordoned area with
                          clearly marked delineation the take-off and landing operations.
                      o Signage and Identifying Clothing: The PIC will place signage at
                          each entry point within the operations area alerting people to
                          the following:
                               A. Low altitude aerial work is being conducted
                               B. Use of any actual sensing equipment being used
                               C. A request asking people to not enter the area without
                                   first notifying the PIC or SDI designated on-site flight
                                    operations personnel
                               D. PIC and VO will put on outerwear that will identify them
                                    in their respective roles. Signage will be attached on
                                    their person that will instruct law-enforcement,
                                    observers, or any other people present that they are not
                                    to be interrupted un-necessarily while conducting flight
                                    operations.

                                                               17
· Anemometer Weather Check- Beyond pre-site planning weather forecast
    checks, SDI requires that the PIC conduct specific on-site weather checks.
    The PIC will utilize a hand-held or portable Anemometer to determine wind
    speed, direction, temperature, and humidity. Aerial operations will only be
    conducted within the specific recommended wind and humidity limitations
    of the UAS manufacturer's operating manuals, or if not identified therein,
    only in conditions where wind speed is less than 15m ph, gusting up to
    20m ph.

· Crew Briefing- SDI flight operations personnel will typically include the PIC,
    VO, and other possible ground crew. The operations personnel, in addition
    to any other parties that may be present, will be briefed prior to the start of
    operations. The briefing will include:
                 o Introduction to the equipment being used including the UAS
                      and the ground station functions, with particular emphasis on
                      moving parts including weight of the UAS, and the harm or
                      damage that could possibly be inflicted by coming into contact
                      with those components {particularly the propellers, and hot
                      surfaces)
                 o Familiarization with the failsafe return-to-home systems and
                      instruction on how to activate those systems if the PIC is
                      unable to activate those systems
                 o Expected flight plan, holding positions, flight duration, and
                      overall flight boundaries.
                 o Expected responsibilities and authority of each flight
                      operations personnel
                 o Identification and familiarization with the take-off and landing
                      designated areas, and the requirements for remaining clear of
                      those areas at all times.
                 o The need for all present to alert the PIC of any encroachments
                      of people or objects into the airspace and ground boundaries
                 o Importance of mitigating any possible distractions or un-
                      necessary communication with the PIC during operations
                 o Careful review of Lost Link and emergency procedures

· Communications- SDI uses channel-hopping technology on 2.4GHz to
    maintain communications with the UAV for the purposes of platform
    control. There is no communication ('downlink') from the UAV to the

                                                          18
    ground station. In the event of loss of or interference with the control
    frequency, the UAV is programmed to return to its take-off position and
    land autonomously ('return-to-home'}. This failsafe procedure is described
    further under Emergency Procedures.

· Frequency Scans- SDI will perform frequency scans to help identify
    possible conflict with radio communications. This will be performed via a
    hand-held or portable radio spectrum scanner by the PIC. These scans will
    include a full spectrum scan of the applicable frequency range of the UAS.
    Possible sources of radio interference or conflict will be identified and
    evaluated to determine if flight operations can be safely continued.

· Recharging and Battery Use (Fuel Management)- The DJI Inspire utilizes a
    4,500mAh 22.8 V LiPo {{intelligent" battery. Batteries are charged at base
    prior to flight operations. The number of batteries that will be transported
    to the flight operations area will be based on the specific needs of the flight
    operations or mission. The battery capacity will be tested utilizing the
    internal proprietary tester on the battery, and will also be checked utilizing
    the proprietary DJI software, as well as any internally sensed telemetry
    software and hardware attached to the UAS. A battery charge log will be
    kept via the proprietary DJI Inspire software and will be completed prior to
    every flight. Any battery found to be less than fully-charged, damaged,
    displays insufficient voltage, or otherwise defective will not be used.

· Load-outs and Equipment- The lnpire is a simple quad-copter UAS with
    limited capability for loads and equipment. Removable equipment includes
    the battery, gimbal, camera, telemetry hardware, antenna, and imaging
    transmitter. The battery is held in place via proprietary fittings. The gimbal
    is attached via screws into the airframe. The camera is attached to the
    gimbal using screws and a proprietary harness. All other equipment is
    attached using nylon fittings, Velcro, or adhesives. Total takeoff weight
    with these components will not exceed the maximum recommended take-
    off weight identified in the Inspire Users/operators Manual of 2935 grams.
    Payload security is tested prior to any operations both visually and by
    vigorous tactile testing. All attachment points will be inspected and tested
    weekly.

                                                          19
                              FLIGHT PROCEDURES

SDI will utilize checklists to direct the flight operations personnel in flight
procedures. The following section will continually refer to the several checklists
presented in the Appendix.

    · Motor Start- All of the various preflight checks will have been performed
         prior to motor start and will include:
             o PIC and VO will put on identifying outerwear.
             o Pre-flight compass calibration, GPS verification, and voltage
                 diagnostics completed.
             o Take-off position and location is checked to ensure it is clear of
                 obstacles, debris, potential hazards, and people.
             o Transmitter switches are placed in the proper configuration,
                 including the home switch and GPS mode switch.
             o Transmitter is on and properly charged with voltage confirmed.
             o Battery is secured, on, and properly seated.
             o Camera and gimbal is armed, responding to commands, and
                  stabilized.
             o UAS is placed in the proper takeoff position.
             o LED flight mode indicator, and telemetry read-out shows adequate
                 GPS connectivity according to the DJI Inspire User/operators Manual.
             o LED flight mode indicators and telemetry read-outs show the proper
                 flight mode is selected DJI Inspire User/operators Manual.
             o Camera is switched on.
             o All flight operations personnel are in their proper position and at the
                  ready.
             o Start motors, and establish functional pre-take-off power setting.

    · Take-Off- Once motors have been started, the PIC will verify that the pre-
        take-off checklist has been completed. Once this has been verified, the PIC
         will follow the following take-off procedure:
             1. Apply power for a controlled ascent to a safe low-level test altitude
                  over the take-off area, and then hold.
             2. After in hold, PIC performs check of all control stick response
                  including rudder, aileron, elevator, and throttle to ensure proper
                  response to commands.

                                                                20
        3. PIC confirms with VO that the flight operations area is free of
             obstructions or other manned or unmanned air traffic.

        4. PIC confirms with all flight operations personnel that they are ready
             to proceed with flight operations as planned.

· In-Flight- SDI requires that the PIC is free to concentrate on positioning,
    scanning, and monitoring systems and the flight operations area without
    un-necessary distraction, and to ensure the flight is compliant with
    remaining 500ft clear of all non-participating persons, vessels, vehicles, or
    structures unless proper permissions have been obtained as described in
    the previous section addressing the selection of sites. Throughout the
    flight, PIC will take particular care to remain within the established
    operating permissions and envelope by executing the following practices:
        o Verify through verbal communication with the VO that they are
             alerted to any manned or unmanned aircraft within the flight area.
        o Verify through verbal communication with the VO that obstacles are
             being identified and avoided.
        o Interval monitoring of voltage and communication with UAV to
             ensure adequate voltage according to the DJI Phantom 2
             User/operating Manual for safe return and landing.
        o Monitor time since motors were started to ensure a minimum of 3
             minutes of battery fuel is available for return and landing of UAV.
        o A safety margin of a minimum of 3 minutes of battery life is
             maintained at all times.
        o Maintain visual contact with flight systems/mode and battery LED
             light indicators at all times.
        o Maintain situational awareness of changes in weather, visibility, or
             cloud avoidance at all times.
        o Maintain operation speeds less than lOOmph.
        o Maintain visual contact with UAV at all times.
        o Ensure VO has visual contact with the UAV in flight at all times.
             Establish a position hold until VO re-establishes visual contact with
             the UAV if contact is lost.

· Let-Down/Landing- To execute a safe recovery and landing of the UAV, the
    PIC will ensure that the following practices are followed:

                                                         21
          o Establish and guide the UAV through a safe route to directly above
              the cordoned take-off and landing area.

          o Maintain a safe descent rate and follows all procedures and
              techniques to avoid vortex state or settling with power.

          o Verify that a minimum of 3 minutes of battery life is available, as
              mentioned above, to ensure a holding position if the landing area is
              not cleared.

          o Verify that the landing area is clear of debris, obstacles, people, or
              hazards that would preclude a safe landing.

· Shutdown- Upon landing, the throttle is returned to the home position
    causing the rotors to stop spinning. Operations then proceed as follows:
            · The UAV battery is switched off or disconnected.
            · The camera is stopped and is then switched off.
            · The UAV is removed from the landing area and is checked for
                   any abnormalities or damage.
            · The transmitter is switched off.
            · The UAV battery is removed, tested, and then the battery is
                   safely secured and stored.

                                                         22
                        EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

The emergency procedures described below address the following, safety-critical

question: In the event ofa malfunction failure or other in-flight emergenc~ how
is the UAS going to safely land without creating a hazard to other airspace users
or persons or property on the ground?

MOTOR THRUST LOSS
As a quad copter, The Phantom 2 has no 'rotor redundancy'. Loss of power to a
motor on a quad copter will result in a crash. For this reason, SDI takes specific
preventative steps to ensure that loss of power to a motor will not occur:

    · Wiring integrity is checked visually prior to any flight operations.
    · A pre-flight battery check is undertaken to test the charge of the cells.
    · Upon take-off, the UAS is lifted into a temporary, low-altitude holding

         position and the throttle/ rudder and aileron/elevator control sticks are
         moved to check that UAV is responding as expected.

If there is a loss of thrust to a motor, any residual control left available to the PIC
will be used to guide the UAV away from people and objects to avoid injury or
damage to property and people. Every effort will be made to restrict the crash
site to the safest possible position.

UAV BATTERY FAILURE
As has been addressed in above previous sections, SDI has procedures and
practices in place designed to prevent UAV batter failure or malfunction, and they
include:

    · The batteries are physically inspected and tested through all phases of pre-
        flight and post flight for damage or swelling

    · The Battery performance and condition is tested prior to each flight to
         ensure they are fully charged, and the proprietary DJI Inspire software
         charge track/log is checked to ensure the battery meets the minimum safe
         requirements as specified by DJI in operating manual and firmware specs.

    · Throughout all phases of flight, the battery voltage, percentage of charge
         remaining, and time in operation is constantly monitored via the telemetry
         transmission to the ground station to ensure there is the proper minimum
         voltage and time to return and land is achieved and maintained.

    · The PIC will immediately land the UAV in the nearest possible landing area

                                                              23
if telemetry indicates the minimum voltage, time in operation, or
percentage of charge are not met.

BATIERY FAILURE FAILSAFE
As a preventative measure to keep the UAV from a forced landing or crash due to
battery failure, the DJIInspire flight controller has several levels of low voltage
protections incorporated as specified in the attached User/Operator's Manual,
triggering an automated Failsafe Return to Home and Landing command as
follows:

    · The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to
         depletion during flight. When it appears, users should promptly fly back
         and land to avoid accidental damage. The Inspire has two levels of low
         battery capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than
         30% power and the second appears when it has less than 15% power. The
         following list details the battery power warnings:
                      o When battery power drops below 30% the LED indicator will
                           blink red slowly.
                      o At lower than 15%, the LED indicator will blink red rapidly. The
                           Phantom 2 will also begin to descend and land automatically.
                           After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or

                 execute esc.

                      o There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the
                           1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V as its threshold.
                           Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery
                           Warning will trigger auto-landing.

.....· Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the Throttle stick.
                                                   1st Level Low Battery Capacity Warning

·········  2nd Level Low Battery Capacity Warning
           Not Stationary or Sensor Bias is too big

           Errors &Aircraft cannot fly.*

···        Compass data abnormal because of ferro-magnetic
           interference or the compass needs calibration.

           24
TRANSMITTER/CONTROLLER BATTERY FAILURE
As has been mentioned previously, through the extensive use of checklist
procedures, SDI requires that the PIC ensure the DJIInspire controller (ground
station) will be fully charged prior to any aerial operation. Any monitors being
used to display telemetry will also be fully charged.

CONTROLLER BATTERY FAILSAFE
SDI will use The DJIInspire flight control system that incorporates an automated
failsafe system which commands the UAV to return to home and land if there is a
loss of frequency due to battery failure. The PIC will reference the below LED
lighting system to monitor the controller charge;

Remote Controller Power LED Indicator Status

······  None Normal
····    8-8-8...... Low voltage (at 4V-4.3V). Replace the batteries immediately
        8--B--B..... . Alert will sound after 15 minutes of inactivity. It will stop

                     once you start using the remote controller.

               The remote controller will power off automatically when battery voltage drops below 4V. Land and
               change batteries as soon as possible when the low voltage alert occurs to avoid loss of control during
               flight.

LOSS OF CONTROL FREQUENCY {and/or Ground Station Failure}
To help prevent a loss of control frequency, SDI requires that the PIC ensure flight
operations only occur within un-aided visual line of site VLOS at all times. Doing
so will keep the UAV well within the required minimum range of the DJI Inspire
controller/transmitter.

LOSS OF CONTROL FREQUENCY FAILSAFE
If the control frequency signal is lost for more than 3 seconds (UAS out of range,
ground station failure etc.) the DJI Inspire Flight Controller has been programmed
to switch the UAS into failsafe mode and it will'return to home' (RTH} and also
land:

      · If the failsafe occurs while in GPS mode according to the parameters of
           the DJIInspire User/Operator Manual, the UAV will return to the take-off

                                                              25
           and landing area and auto-land.
      · If the fail location occurs while in ATil mode according to the parameters

           of the DJIInspire User/Operator Manual, the UAV will auto-land.
      · The RTH failsafe mechanism works by the UAS Flight Controller saving the

           home (take-off) point automatically when the throttle stick is moved for
           the first time (after 6 or more GPS satellites have been acquired-
           denoted by a single red pulse from the LED or a series of continuous
           green pulses).

The RTH failsafe function on the UAS is tested on a weekly basis by SDI by
switching the transmitter off during a test flight session.

MALICIOUS OR ACCIDENTAL INTERFERENCE WITH CONTROL FREQUENCY
As was mentioned in previous sections, through the extensive use of checklists,
SDI requires that the PIC utilize a Spectrum Scanner to ensure there is no
accidental or malicious radio interference. In the unlikely event that this should
occur, the PIC will initiate the failsafe procedure mentioned in the previous
section

      · Pilot Incapacitation- If the pilot-in-command becomes incapacitated to
           the extent that control of the UAV becomes unviable, the UAV will hover
           in a stationery position until the battery's second level low-voltage
           protection is triggered. At this point, the UAV will descend and land in a
           steady, controlled manner. If an observer is present, they will have been
           briefed on the UAS's failsafe (return-to-home) mode and its activation
           (see Section on "Crew Briefing").

      · Aircraft Incursion- If another aircraft should enter or appears to be
           entering the Visual Line of Sight Operating Envelope VLOS, PIC will
           operate the UAV to immediately maintain safe visual separation, and give
           way to any manned flight operation.

                                                                26
FLY AWAY PROCEDURE
A "fly away" is defined as the loss of control transmission link where the PIC no
longer has control or the ability to command the UAV to remain within the
bounds of the intended operation area. In the unlikely event that this should
occur, the PIC will observe and record the direction of flight heading, speed, and
altitude of the UAV, and then follow the Incident Response Procedure as outlined
below:

      · Crash & Incident Response While SDI takes extreme caution in its flight
           procedures to prevent a loss of control or crash, any incident, accident, or
           operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical boundaries as defined
           by the applicable COA issued must be reported to the FAA UAS
           Integration Office {AFS 80 within 24 hours. The following procedures will
           also be ensured by the PIC:
                        o PIC will have on their person a copy of the local emergency
                             response contact information, including fire, law
                             enforcement, medical response, and the UAS Integration
                             Office contact information

                                                                     27
