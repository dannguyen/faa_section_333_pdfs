                                                           Exemption No. 12102
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0965

Mr. Keith Cottrill
Innovative Ventures
502 Southwood Drive
Bossier City, LA 71111

Dear Mr. Cottrill:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 31, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Innovative Ventures (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct exploration,
usage, and management of land and mineral rights.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are a DJI Phantom 2 and a Turbo Ace Matrix.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
                                                                                                                 2

aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Innovative Ventures is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Innovative Ventures is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2 and
    Turbo Ace Matrix when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

Assurance of a Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) (9) ASTM manual F3005-14a Standard
Specification for Batteries for Use in Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS)

Unmanned Aircraft System

The petitioner states he plans to operate two UAS, the PHANTOM 2 and the Turbo Ace Matrix, both are
comprised of an unmanned aircraft (UA, PHANTOM, or Turbo Ace Matrix) and a transportable ground
station. Both UAS are referred to as a quad-copter with a maximum gross weight of about 3 pounds.
They are equipped with four rotors that are driven by electric motors powered by batteries.

The Phantom UAS will be utilized as a training module to provide comparable experience to ensure
safety while utilizing the Turbo Ace Matrix UAS. The petitioner plans to attach a small lightweight GoPro
4+ camera to his UA and operate the UA over various areas in the south central United States to
enhance academic community awareness and augment land and mineral exploration, use, and
management. Petitioner makes the following representations of operational enhancements which he
proposes to abide by to ensure this exemption will provide a level of safety at least equal to existing
rules:

         · He will only operate in reasonably safe environments that are strictly controlled, are away
         from power lines, elevated lights, airports and actively populated areas;

         · He will conduct extensive preflight inspections and protocols, during which safety carries
         primary importance.

The petitioner states that given the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft to be utilized by him, an exemption from 14 CFR part 21, Subpart H (Airworthiness Certificates)
and § 91.203 (a) and (b) (Certifications required), subject to certain conditions and limitations, is
warranted and meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety under 14 CFR part 11 and
Section 333 of P.L. 112-95 (Section 333).

Petitioner requests an exemption from § 45.23 Marking of the aircraft because his UA will not have a
cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or phrases. Further, he states that two-
inch lettering is difficult to place on such a small aircraft with dimensions smaller than the minimal
lettering requirement. Regardless of this, petitioner states that he will mark his UAS in the largest
possible lettering by placing the word "Limited" on its fuselage as required by § 45.29(f) so that he or
anyone assisting him as a spotter will see the markings.

The petitioner states that an exemption from §§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(2) and 91.417(a) and
(b) Maintenance inspections may be required and should be granted since they only apply to aircraft
with an airworthiness certificate. However, the petitioner states as a safety precaution he will perform a
preflight inspection of his UAS before each flight as outlined in his operating documents.

                                                         Page 5 of 7
UAS Pilot in Command (PIC)

The petitioner asserts that under § 61.113 (a) and (b) private pilots are limited to non-commercial
operations, however he can achieve an equivalent level of safety as achieved by current regulations
because his UAS does not carry any pilots or passengers. Further, he states that, while helpful, a pilot
license will not ensure remote control piloting skills. He further indicates that the risks of operating a
UAS are far less than the risk levels inherent in the commercial activities outlined in 14 CFR part 61, et
seq., thus he requests an exemption from § 61.113 Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in
command.

Regarding UAS operational training, the petitioner states he has flown numerous practice flights in
remote areas as a hobbyist simulating flights for future commercial use to gain familiarization with the
characteristics of his UAS' performance under different temperature and weather conditions. He further
states that he has over 3,000 hours and has been certified as a multi-engine, instrument qualified pilot.
He is a retired USAF bomber pilot and instructor.

UAS Operating Parameters

The petitioner states that he will abide by the following additional operating conditions under this
exemption:

         · operate his UAS below 1,000 feet and within a radius distance of 1000 feet from the controller
         to both aid in direct line of sight visual observation;

         · operate the UAS for 30 minutes per flight;

         · land his UAS prior to the manufacturer's recommended minimum level of battery power;

         · operate his UAS only within visual line of sight (VLOS);

         · use the UAS' global positioning system (GPS) flight safety feature whereby it hovers and then
         slowly lands if communication with the remote control pilot is lost;

         · conduct all operations under his own personal and flight safety protocols (including posting a
         warning sign reading: "Attention Aerial Photography in Progress ­ Remain Back 150 feet")
         contained in the operating documents and will actively analyze flight data and other sources of
         information to constantly update and enhance his safety protocols;

         · contact respective airports if operations will be within 5 miles to advise them of his estimated
         flight time, flight duration, elevation of flight and other pertinent information;

         · always obtain all necessary permissions prior to operation; and

         · have procedures in place to abort flights in the event of safety breaches or potential danger.

                                                         Page 6 of 7
Petitioner states that § 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate.
The petitioner asserts that since there is currently no certificate applicable to his operation, this
regulation is inapplicable.

Petitioner states that § 91.9(b)(2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft, however since there
are no pilots or passengers on board his aircraft and given its size, this regulation is inapplicable. He
further indicates an equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a safety/flight manual with
the UAS ground station.

Although petitioner requests an exemption from § 91.103(b) Preflight action, he provides no
information supporting his request.

Similarly, the petitioner requests an exemption from § 91.109 Flight instruction; simulated instrument
flight and certain flight test, and provides no information indicating how safety will be maintained if an
exemption to this section is granted.

Petitioner states that § 91.119 prescribes safe altitudes for the operation of civil aircraft, but that it
allows helicopters to be operated at lower altitudes in certain conditions. Petitioner states he will not
operate his UAS above the altitude of 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) and will also only operate in
safe areas away from the public and traffic, thus providing a level of safety at least equivalent to those in
relation to minimum safe altitudes. The petitioner asserts that given the size, weight, maneuverability,
and speed of his UAS, an equivalent or higher level of safety will be achieved.

Petitioner indicates that § 91.121 Altimeter settings is inapplicable since he UAS utilizes electronic GPS
with a barometric sensor.

While petitioner requests an exemption from § 91.151(a) Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions,
the UAS specified for this exemption has an auto return function in case of power loss, or loss of
communication with PIC.

Public Interest

The petitioner states that aerial videography for geographical awareness and for land and mineral
exploration, use, and management has been around for a long time through manned fixed wing aircraft
and helicopters. Thus far vast expense of these services has been cost-prohibitive. Granting this
exemption to the petitioner would allow him to provide this service at a much lower cost. Further, the
petitioner indicates his small UAS will pose no threat to the public given its small size and lack of
combustible fuel when compared to larger manned aircraft. The petitioner also states that the
operation of his UAS will minimize ecological damage and promote economic growth by providing
information to companies and individuals looking to explore the possible uses and management of their
land.

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote controller and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control

system connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more

information.

1.2 Connections with Other DJI Products

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G Wi-Fi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
          updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
          while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote controller's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range

during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Controller Operation

  The operations of remote controller are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote controller are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote controller is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

                                          altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                          Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                          position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                                          suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                          prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                          elevation changes.

                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                                      clock-wise.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      forward.
                                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                                      stick is centered.
                                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                                      faster flight velocity.
                                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                                      centered.
                                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

A                                         BC          D

                                          Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote controller.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Controller Operation>

      for more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 |
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
          4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote controller is lost. The flight control
system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote controller and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote controller is powered off.
2 The remote controller is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must

        have been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote controller.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote controller and the aircraft, essentially

        reducing the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote controller.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

©2013-2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 |
Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures                         2 Flying.                                         3 Remote controller signal lost.

          1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
                   will descend automatically.

          2 When the aircraft is landing automatically, users can control the aircraft's position and altitude if
                   the remote controller signal is recovered.

          In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
          as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
          controller from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position
          as a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks
          on the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:

          1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is
                   recorded last time.

          2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

               distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote controller's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,
                      make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Welcome to the World of Quadcopters

The MATRIX is spawning a new era in super quadcopter design. Its larger & powerful
motors, propellers and batteries offer up to three times the flight time and payload of a
traditional quad. The extra payload and flight time allow you to carry a variety of
cameras to produce unmatched cinematic quality video. Sporty low-profile architecture,
its triple carbon fiber deck supports an extra wide 1000mm wingspan that folds down to
fit inside an optional aluminum carrying case (no dismounting and remounting of
propellers, landing skids or gimbal required). The MATRIX's ideally positioned camera
mount on the nose offers wide angle views unobstructed by propeller shadows,
reflections and landing skids. Its well-balanced center of gravity, with battery and gimbal
position flexibility, greatly reduces swinging and improves the video quality of the
traditional under-mounted battery/gimbal design.

Quadcopters are loosely classified into several categories - from toys for amusement to
complex units for professional video, science & research. Now, a new class of quadcopter
is emerging for commercial applications. The Turbo Ace MATRIX is the clear leader in
this group with a list of outstanding features: advanced PC interface (so you can update
or customize the flight controller), cutting edge auto-stabilizing mode for videographers,
anti-vibration mounts, dynamically balanced motors for high definition video production,
and a host of other upgrades to improve reliability. Unlike most quadcopters, the
MATRIX is fully assembled and tested in the USA for outdoor flight and it is ready to
produce high quality video right out of the box. If you are starting from scratch, the
MATRIX RTF package even includes a paired transmitter that is fully programmed and
calibrated. If you already have a transmitter, all you need is an ARF package. For
additional cross-training, you can choose from our optional professional Phoenix flight
simulator, an easy-to-fly helicopter, and/or a mini Walkera QR X350 quad. As with all
Wow Hobbies' featured RC helicopters, MATRIX parts, upgrades and accessories are
fully supported online and locally in the USA.

1.2 Important Instructions

* Read the entire Matrix Instruction Manual on your included USB flash drive before you
operate the Matrix.

* Follow the instruction manual for a tied down flight test on a bench. This is the safest way to
make sure the Matrix quadcopter has not been damaged during shipping.
* Foldable Matrix aluminum arms operate on guiding carbon tracks with keyed circular locks on
each end. To release the arm from the folded or operating ends of the track, please unscrew the
arm bolt counter-clockwise for a height of 1/8" before the lock will release. If the bolt is not
unscrewed to a sufficient height, you may risk scratching the carbon track.
* Prior to each takeoff, make sure the GPS antenna/compass is erected from the folded position
and screwed down.
* When mounting a propeller, use loctite and make sure the propeller clamp sits flat against the
top of the propeller. Even new propellers may need to be balanced if vibration shows on video.
Use a blade balancer with heavy gauge tape adhered to the underside of the blade for balance. In
bright sunlight, the GoPro 3 may show rolling shutter jello. Use ND8 filter if necessary to slow
down its shutter speed.
* Battery must be positioned by moving it backward and forward until the front and back weights
are balanced from the center point of the Naza flight controller. You can lift the matrix up with a
finger on each side of the matrix to check the balance (see manual for details). The battery can be
placed either on top or bottom of the Matrix.
* Camera must be balanced like a seesaw on a brushless gimbal, otherwise the gimbal motors will
be stressed and vibrate.

Maintaining the Matrix's LiPo Batteries

* Matrix batteries are made up of 6 cells and each cell must be maintained between 3.7V to 4.2V.
The total voltage for Matrix batteries should be maintained between 22.2V (3.7Vx6) and 25.2V
(4.2Vx6) without load. It's very important to keep each cell above 3.7V. A cell is at risk of being
damaged or life shortened at 3.67V per cell without load.
* Each Matrix battery includes a yellow charging/discharging plug and a white balancing plug.
Both plugs must be plugged in to charge the battery. The yellow plug with thicker gauge wires
enables a faster charge rate, while the white plug with 1 small red wire and 6 small black wires
enables the charger to balance charge 6 individual cells. When all 6 cells reach approximately
4.2V each for a total of 25.2V, the charger will automatically stop.
* A battery meter is one of the easiest way to monitor voltage for any LiPo battery. There
are seven pins on the battery meter. One of the pins is marked with a "-" symbol, which should

     5
Turbo Ace MATRIX

line up with the black wire of the battery's white balancing plug. The first number displayed is
the total voltage of the battery, followed by each individual cell.

Before & After Each Flight

* Attitude mode is the most reliable way to fly for experienced pilots, as it is not susceptible to
GPS interference. GPS mode is commonly used by beginners, but once more experience is
acquired, attitude mode is highly recommended (you can still use GPS mode as a backup). When
orientation is lost, do not panic. Just flip to GPS mode and let go of the cyclic stick, and GPS will
take over. Do not to attempt to recover the craft with the cyclic stick. There is a certain time of
the year in which solar flare may interfere with GPS. To recover the craft in such a case, switch to
manual (not attitude) mode. Please be aware that if the Matrix has passed through airport X-ray
screening, near a magnet or has been relocated more than 30 miles from where it was originally
calibrated, the GPS may need to be recalibrated depending on the geographic latitude at which
you are located (see manual).
* Before each flight, always turn on the transmitter first, then plug in the Matrix battery. Then,
you need to allow enough time for the flight controller and GPS to warm up and initialize. The
Naza Lite takes approximately 2 minutes to warm up. The yellow LED light will turn off when
the Naza Lite is ready for use.
* After each flight, always unplug the Matrix battery first, then turn off the transmitter. If you
forget, the quadcopter and/or transmitter will continue to drain power and the battery will be
damaged.

Dos

* Do initialize the Matrix & takeoff from a large, leveled surface.
* Do implement a pre-flight checklist & use it consistently before takeoff.
* Do unplug the Matrix battery when maintaining or upgrading the quadcopter.
* Do dismount propellers if battery is plugged in while updating the flight controller.

Don'ts

* Don't operate near people or pets & do not allow people to approach an operating quadcopter.

* Don't use magnets (e.g. magnetized screwdrivers & tools) in close proximity to the GPS
antenna/compass.

* Don't attempt to catch a quadcopter.

1.3 Quick Start

The MATRIX has a convenient foldable arm / landing skid design. When you first
remove it from the box, please make sure that the GPS antenna (See diagram 2.5) is
erected and properly tightened by turning the top locking cylinder in a clock-wise
direction. Next, loosen the arm screws located on top of the folding track. These screws
are keyed so they must be loosened and raised by about 1/8 of an inch in order for the
arms to fold, unfold the arms, and tighten them back in a clock-wise manner. Make sure
the round key located on the bottom of the screw is securely locked into the circular key
on the track. When it is properly locked in, it will prevent the arms from accidentally
folding during flight. Next, if you wish to fold the landing skid, you may loosen the 2
side screws on each of the 4 legs. Pull the leg down to lengthen it. Tighten the 2 screws
back on each of the landing skid legs. Refer to section 5 TESTING & OPERATIONS
(Please DO NOT install the propellers during the testing procedure). Attach the battery to
either on top or bottom of the Matrix. Lift the Matrix up with one finger on each side
from the center of Naza flight controller. Move the battery until the Matrix is leveled like
a see-saw with equal weight on both sides. See Figure 3.4.4. It is important to note that
the Matrix will not fly properly and may lose control and crash if the center of gravity is
not balanced at the middle of the Naza flight control. Turn on the transmitter and within 2
seconds plug in the MATRIX battery to bind. If your unit comes with DJI NAZA, please
observe the blinking yellow LED light located behind the quad, which indicates the
controller is in warm up stage. Wait for about 2 minutes until the yellow light stops
flashing. Please check the LED light description at section 5.3 and 5.4. Attitude mode is
the most reliable way to fly for intermediate to advance level pilots as all GPS is
susceptible to interference and sun spots activities. However, GPS remains to be the
easiest and the safest way to fly for beginners. Select the attitude mode from your
transmitter, if you are a trained pilot and use the GPS mode as a backup. Move both
sticks of the transmitter together in one action down to the lower right or left corner to
start the motors. Release right stick and immediately give the left stick about 10%
throttles so the motors will not cease. It will not lift off until the throttle stick passes 50%.
Have an experienced pilot test fly it on a bench while tied down. No defective claim is
allowed if the unit is crashed, so please be very careful.

1.8 Caution & Safety

 As the operator of the Turbo Ace MATRIX, it is your responsibility to follow all
    proper procedures, protocols and precautions to ensure the safe operation of the
    MATRIX. The operator must wear safety glasses and any bystanders must be
    protected in a safe area. Do not operate the MATRIX in the proximity of
    children, pets, cars and other vulnerable property. The owner and the operator of
    the MATRIX assumes all liability for any damages caused in the operation of the
    MATRIX, including but not limited to personal injury, equipment and property
    damage.

 If your package includes a transmitter radio, do not pull on the transmitter's
    antenna when removing it from the foam packaging tray. Remove the transmitter
    by pulling on the neck strap holder.

 Since the MATRIX propellers are dismounted for shipping purposes, you must first
    follow the setup instructions in this user manual to mount the propellers. Any attempt
    to skip procedures will end in a bad crash.

 Do not be tempted to fly a new and large RC aircraft, such as the MATRIX, out
    of the box, especially after shipping. Prior to its maiden flight, please tie the
    MATRIX down to a stationary workbench for 3 battery test flights. Any crashed
    aircraft is not eligible for dead-on-arrival or any other defective equipment claims. If
    you are new to RC equipment, please seek the help of an experienced RC equipment
    operator to prevent damage and injury.

 If you have purchased a MATRIX ARF package, you must first program the
    end points of each ESC then calibrate your transmitter to the MATRIX (See
    Section 4.2). If you are using your own transmitter you must reprogram each
    ESC independently. (See Section 4.1). Any attempt to fly without proper transmitter
    calibration and ESC programming will result in a crash and it will invalidate any

   10
Turbo Ace MATRIX

    DOA claim. If you have purchased an RTF (ready-to-fly) unit with transmitter, please
    ignore these steps.
 Additional Velcro should be added on the flight battery to prevent the battery sliding
    from side to side.
 Operator must tie down MATRIX and remove all propellers when it is hooked
    up to a computer. Any incorrect settings or values may trigger an accidental motor
    startup. Turbo Ace, its distributors and dealers are not liable for any damages caused
    by mishandling of the MATRIX and its associated equipment.
 Operator should use Loctite to secure all necessary screws on the MATRIX,
    excluding propeller locking screws. Blue Loctite can be applied directly to the
    screw and should not come in contact with any plastic propellers or parts which will
    crack during flight. Please do not use red Loctite, as it can only be removed with
    extreme heat.

1.9 DOA Claim

Even though the main assembly with attached electronics has been assembled and tested
in the USA before it is shipped to you. If your package includes a receiver or transmitter,
the whole package will be tested as a complete set. If your order does not include a
transmitter, you will be required to program the end points of each ESC and calibrate
your transmitter.

 DOA (Dead-On-Arrival) must be claimed within 24 hours of receipt.
 Do not return any products without authorization. If you need to return a product for

      service, you will need to acquire a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA
      Number) through e-mail (support@wowhobbies.com) or our website. If we don't
      have a record of your request, your returned product will be rejected.
 No DOA claims can be made when you pick up your MATRIX from our store
      because it will be test flown live before you take it home.
 No DOA claims can be made once the device has been crashed, including, but not
      limited to, blades tipping on the ground or any equipment failure after shipping that
      was not uncovered by skipping the 3 battery test flights with the tie-down bench test.
 There is no warranty, return or exchange on all RC products.

3.3 Mounting Propellers

There are a total of 4 propellers in your package.
(1) Unscrew and remove the propeller screws from the motor and remove the motor

    cover.
(2) Due to the precision needed to reduce vibration, the propellers are design to fit

    tightly on the motors. Using the figure below, insert labeled propeller to
    corresponding motor. Motors #1 & #3 use Counter Clockwise propellers and
    motors #2 and #4 use Clockwise propellers. Failure to mount the correct
    propeller(s) on the designated motor will result in a crash.
(3) Over tightening the motor cover screw may damage the motor aluminum threads.
    Repeat this for all 4 propellers.

3.4 Battery Requirements & Installation

(1) Standard Battery: 6-S LiPo, 22.2V, 5300mAh, 35C, 1P
(2) Optional Extended Flight Battery: 6-S LiPo 22.2V, 8000mAh, 25/50C, 1P
(3) Release the two wide Velcro battery straps on the tail of the MATRIX bottom

      plate. Make sure a Velcro strip is added to the battery and the body of the Matrix
      to prevent it from sliding. Secure it with the two wide Velcro battery straps.

ELECTRONICS SETUP & ADJUSTMENT for
Walkera Devo 10 Transmitter

If you have purchased an RTF package, please skip Section 4.1 through 4.5
because all settings are already complete and your MATRIX and transmitter have
been paired and test flown as a set. Unless you are familiar with the settings, any
changes might override the factory's setting and disable the aircraft, affecting its
performance and flight reliability.

If you have purchased an ARF package, you must complete Section 4.1 ESC
Programming and Section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration. MATRIX ESCs needs to
reprogram independently. Also, in order for a flight controller to work properly, your
specific transmitter has to be calibrated to work with each new MATRIX. Crashes
will be imminent if you skip these one-time procedures to match a MATRIX with a
transmitter.

4.1 ESC Programming for Transmitter (A Must Setup For ARF)

Video Instruction:
How to calibrate the ESC for MATRIX:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/zcf72jgoeng92c9/How%20to%20calibrate%20the%20ES
C.MP4

Please skip this ESC programming step if you have purchased RTF unit, since all
ESC have been re-programmed. Please follow the steps below very carefully, as they
will only take a few minutes.

    (1) Very important: Remove all 4 propellers from the motors for safety.
    (2) Double check to make sure all ESC connectors are marked/labeled (#1

           through #4 matching the connectors on the flight controller #1 through #4)
           so that you will be able to keep track of the corresponding connectors when
           you need to put them back later.
    (3) Disconnect all 4 ESC connectors from the NAZA flight controller so they
           may not interfere with each other's programming.
    (4) Move the throttle stick all the way down. Now turn on the transmitter.

   19
Turbo Ace MATRIX

    (5) Disconnect X3 on NAZA flight controller and plug into AUX1 on the
           receiver.

    (6) Insert one of the labeled ESC connectors into the receiver's throttle channel
           port while watching for the correct polarity. Black/dark brown wires are
           usually on the edge of the receiver. Please verify polarity in your receiver
           manual if you are not using the stock Walkera receiver.

    (7) Move the throttle stick all the way up.
    (8) Within 3 seconds, connect the battery to the MATRIX's battery plug (The

           MATRIX battery plug is still connected to all 4 ESCs but only one ESC
           should be connected to the receiver at a time.)
    (9) When the ESC makes 1 beeping sounds, immediately move the throttle stick
           all the way down. The ESC will then make 2 beeping. (If you did not hear
           the 1 beeping sounds when entering programming mode or you did not hear
           2 beeping after the ESC have completed its programming then you need to
           move throttle all the way down and disconnect the battery from the
           MATRIX battery plug and repeat from step #6 to #9 for the ESC.) If you did
           not experience any problems, then you have completed programming on this
           ESC which now retains the high and low end point data in its memory.
           Disconnect the battery from the MATRIX's battery connector then
           disconnect the ESC connector from the receiver.
    (10) Repeat this process for each ESC from Step#6 through Step#9. Please make
           sure you have programmed all 4 ESCs by starting from the #1 labeled ESC
           and finishing with #4 labeled ESC. Your transmitter power should remain in
           the power on position throughout the entire process of programming all 4
           ESCs.
    (11) After you have successfully re-programmed all 4 ESCs, unplug the battery
           from the MATRIX battery plug then turn off the transmitter.
    (12) Insert the 4 ESC connectors, labeled #1 through #4 back to corresponding
           M1 through M4 ports on your NAZA flight controller. The black/dark
           brown wire (-) for each of the ESC connectors are closest to the red NAZA
           label of the flight controller.

    (5) CONTROL MODE SWITCH: (Please see Section 4.7 MATRIX Wiring

         Connection Chart)
          Setting the GPS Attitude and Attitude and Manual Mode on the Mix on
          Walkera Devention Transmitter:

Setting the GPS, Attitude and Manual Mode on the Mix Switch on MATRIX:

    (1) The NAZA Assistant screen should show a Control Mode Switch with GPS |
         Fail Safe | A | Fail Safe | M. (The "GPS" represent the GPS Mode, the "A"
         represent "Attitude Mode" and the "M" represent "Manual Mode".) You need
         a 3 position switch for the Control Mode Switch. For example: When using
         Devention 10 and RX 1002, the Control Mode Switch is assigned to the MIX
         SWITCH on the transmitter. This is done by connecting the Receiver's Gear
         channel to the Flight Controller's "U" channel (See FIGURE 4.2). Then press
         ENT on the Devo 10Model MenuDevice OutputGear and select MIX
         SW by press L or R and make sure Function shows ACTIVE.

    (2) Now you need to make sure when the MIX SWITCH is flipped forward (away
         from you) the switch will change the flight controller to "GPS Mode". If the
         Control Mode Switch (See FIGURE 4.2 bottom) slider is closer to "M" or "A",
         then the Control Mode Switch slider is in the wrong position. To bring the
         slider closer to "GPS", press ENT button on your transmitterFunction
         MenuReverse SwitchGear and reverse your GEAR SWITCH setting
         (which is now set to your MIX SWITCH setting) by pressing L or R. This
         change will bring the Control Mode Switch slider closer to "GPS".

    (3) Move your MIX SWITCH to the middle position to set the midpoints for the
         middle position first. If the "A" segment turns blue please skip to Step #5.

    (4) If the "A" segment does not turn blue, press ENT on your
         transmitterFunction MenuSub TrimGear and adjust your GEAR

   23
Turbo Ace MATRIX

         SWITCH's midpoint by pressing the L or R button until "A" segment turns
         blue.
    (5) Flip the MIX SWITCH forward (away from you). If the "GPS" segment turns
         blue then skip to Step #7.
    (6) If the "GPS" segment does not turn blue, press ENT on your
         transmitterFunction Menu Travel AdjustGear. Use the UP/DN button
         to select -100.0% and adjust your GEAR SWITCH's endpoint by pressing the
         L or R button until "GPS" segment turns blue.
    (7) Flip the MIX SWITCH backward (towards you). If the "M" segment turns
         blue then skip to Section 4.2.11.
    (8) If the "M" segment does not turn blue, press ENT on your
         transmitterFunction Menu Travel AdjustGear. Use the UP/DN button
         to select +100.0% and adjust your GEAR SWITCH's endpoint by pressing the
         L or R button until "M" segment turns blue.
    (9) If FIXED ID BIND is used, transmitter can be turn on and off to bind and
         re-bind, which will make fail safe testing easier (see Section Fixed ID Bind).
         To test Fail-Safe, press ENT on your transmitterFunction Menu Fail
         SafeGear. Use the UP/DN to adjust the Fail-Safe setting for Gear to around
         -44% and turn off transmitter to check/test if fail safe turn blue on screen (if
         fail safe does not turn blue, re-bind the transmitter and adjust Fail-Safe setting
         for Gear until fail safe turn blue while transmitter is off.) This procedure will
         make sure fail-safe is active while transmitter is off or circumstances signal
         lost during flight.

AUTO PILOT

    (1) BASIC PARAMETERS: Recommend setting for Pitch set to 130%, Roll set
         to 120%, Yaw set to 90% and Vertical set to 120% and ATTITUDE GAIN is
         Pitch set to 100% and Roll set to 100%. REMOTE ADJUST is set to INH.
         Basic Gain and Attitude Gain should never set to lower than 90%, otherwise
         crash might result.

    (2) ENHANCED FAILED-SAFE METHODS (GPS module is required). The
         recommended settings for enhanced failed-safe methods are GO-HOME and
         LANDING. (Please refer to DJI NAZA User Manual's page 21 for enhanced
         failed-safe methods).

    (3) INTELLIGENT ORIENTATION CONTROL (IOC): (GPS module is
         required). Check the box next to "3. Intelligent Orientation Control". If GPS is
         installed, the settings for Devention 10 and RX 1002 are as follows. Assign

   24
Turbo Ace MATRIX

         the intelligent orientation control to the Flight Mode Switch on the transmitter,
         by pressing ENT on the Devention10Model MenuDevice OutputFlap
         (AUX 1) and selecting FMOD SW by pressing L or R (Make sure Type Select
         is Airplane mode, pressing ENT on the Devention10model menutype
         selectairplane) and making sure that Function shows as ACTIVE.

    (1) The NAZA Assistant screen should show INTELLIGENT ORIENTATION
         CONTROL with Home Lock | Course Lock | Off. You need a 3 position
         switch for the Intelligent Orientation Control Switch. For example: When
         using Devention 10 and RX 1002, the Intelligent Orientation Control Switch is
         assigned to the Flight Mode Switch on the transmitter. This is done by
         connecting the Receiver's Flap (AUX 1) channel to the Flight Controller's
         "X2" channel. Then press ENT on the Devo 10Model MenuDevice
         OutputFlap (AUX 1) and select FMOD SW by pressing L or R and making
         sure the Function shows as ACTIVE.

    (2) Now you need to make sure when the FMOD SW is flipped forward (toward
         the ground) the switch will change the Intelligent Orientation Control to "Off".
         If the slider is closer to "Course Lock" or "Home Lock", then the Intelligent
         Orientation Control Switch slider is in the wrong position. To bring the slider
         closer to "Off", press ENT button on your transmitterFunction
         MenuReverse SwitchFlap (AUX 1) and reverse your Flap (AUX 1)
         SWITCH setting (which is now set to your FMOD SW setting) by pressing L
         or R. This change will bring the Intelligent Orientation Control Switch slider
         closer to "Off".

    (3) Move your FMOD SWITCH to the middle position to set the midpoints for
         the middle position first. If the "Course Lock" segment turns blue, please skip
         to Step #5.

    (4) If the "Course Lock" segment does not turn blue, press ENT on your
         transmitterFunction MenuSub TrimFlap (AUX 1) and adjust your
         Flap's (AUX 1) midpoint by pressing the L or R button until "Course Lock"
         segment turns blue.

    (5) Flip the FMOD SWITCH forward (toward the ground). If the "Off" segment
         turns blue then skip to Step #7.

    (6) If the "Off" segment does not turn blue, press ENT on your
         transmitterFunction Menu Travel AdjustFlap (AUX 1). Use the UP/DN
         button to select +100.0% and adjust your Flap (AUX 1)'s endpoint by pressing
         the L or R button until "Off" segment turns blue.

   25

(7) Flip the FMOD SWITCH backward (towards the sky). If the "Home Lock"

    segment turns blue, then skip Step #8.
(8) If the "Home Lock" segment does not turn blue, press ENT on your

    transmitterFunction Menu Travel AdjustFlap (AUX 1). Use the UP/DN
    button to select -100.0% and adjust your GEAR SWITCH's endpoint by
    pressing the L or R button until "Home Lock" segment turns blue.

Home Lock only activates while MATRIX is about 30 feet (10 meters) away from the

Setting up MATRIX to ensure a smooth flight with GPS or Attitude mode
To ensure the smooth flight of your Turbo Ace MATRIX, please make sure that you
setup and fly the MATRIX in GPS or Attitude mode. In order for GPS or Attitude
mode to function, first it is important to make sure the mix switch on your radio is all
the way forward. Please refer to Section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration. If you own a
Walkera radio such as the Devo 10, you will need to reverse the gear channel in your
radio so that when you flip the gear switch forward, it enables GPS or Attitude Mode.

   27
Turbo Ace MATRIX

If you are experiencing difficulties in handling the aircraft, it may be because it is not
in GPS or Attitude Mode.

You may skip the following setup instructions if you have purchased the Turbo Ace
MATRIX with a transmitter radio, as we have already completed all the setup for you.
If you have purchased a MATRIX without a radio, please see the following to make
sure your radio is setup correctly.

Setting up and checking Turbo Ace MATRIX flight mode for GPS or Attitude
Mode.
Plug in a 3 pin cable connector to the "INPUT" channel U of the NAZA flight
controller. Connect the other end of the cable to the GEAR output on your receiver
with the brown wire closest to the edge of the receiver casing (If you have a receiver
other than a Walkera WK2801-PRO, Devention or Spektrum, please check your
receiver manual for polarity).

MATRIX with GPS module (Assign GEAR to 3 position toggle switch, WOW
default MIX switch for Devention 10):
Go to your radio setup, press ENTModel MenuDevice Outputassign GEAR to
MIX SW (MATRIX without GPS). This means that every time the MIX switch is
flipped forward on your radio, it will toggle the GEAR output of the receiver and tell
the controller to perform GPS Mode. If you own a Walkera radio, the gear channel in
the radio should be changed from normal to REVERSE (Please refer to section 4.2
Transmitter Calibration, for detail adjustment for GPS/Attitude/Manual mode) You
can use the NAZA Assistant Software to double check the MIX switch operation after
you have completed the above setup.

Turn on your transmitter radio (Warning: Always tie down the MATRIX and remove
all propellers when you perform any setting changes to the transmitter or NAZA
Assistant Software. Failure to do so may cause serious issues, as the MATRIX motor
may start up if an incorrect value is entered). Connect the provided Programming
USB-to-Micro USB cable from your PC computer's USB port (XP or WIN7) to
Micro USB port on the MATRIX communication port (on the LED side panel of the
MATRIX). Please connect this cable after the transmitter is bound to the receiver.

Double click on the NaZaInstaller.exe located in the provided 8GB USB flash drive to
install the NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE

   28
Turbo Ace MATRIX

After completion of the installation of the NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE, double
click on the application file named NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE. Wait for the
program to start up.

Select the TX Calibration tab at the left column of the screen.

MATRIX with GPS
You will see the 5 mode tabs: GPS, Fail Safe, A, Fail Safe, M. When you flip the
MIX switch on your radio, you will see the selection flipping between GPS and A and
M. When the MIX switch is flipped forward, you will see GPS is selected which
enables GPS Mode. The GPS Mode is the mode you should be using to fly your
MATRIX. M mode has no stabilization and will make it very difficult to operate the
aircraft.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that the MIX switch on your radio is in the
forward/middle position before taking off and during the entire flight. (Please refer to
section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration if GPS and A and M mode do not turn blue on the
screen when you flip the MIX switch).

4.5 Transmitter Settings (For ARF Only)

(1) Aircraft Mode: Fixed-wing airplane mode. Do not use helicopter mode
(2) Rudder: 0% to 100% with No Mixing
(3) Curve: Channel 1, 2, 3 & 4 all set to zero
(4) Gyro: Fine tune to maximize stability
(5) Move both throttle stick and throttle trim by looking at the LCD screen to the

      middle position- Very important, otherwise motors will not start
(6) Use transmitter rudder trim to adjust heading (yaw) (if changes are made to trim

      settings recalibration is required)
(7) For added stability on the MATRIX, you may choose to set the dual rate to 55%

Please double check all settings, tie down the MATRIX to a bench, and test fly it to
check the settings. Some transmitters use random bind, which means you have to plug
in the battery to the MATRIX within 2-3 seconds after the radio is turned on. Please
observe the LED light located at the back of the MATRIX cover (Please refer to
Section 5.3 LED light description). Most receivers flash before binding and remain
solid after binding, so please make sure your receiver has been properly bound to your
transmitter. Do not launch the MATRIX on its maiden flight until all operations are
confirmed as normal, especially after shipping. Tie it down to a bench for a preflight

   29
Turbo Ace MATRIX

check. Failure to do so may cause serious damage to the MATRIX and/or people
around it. Factories and dealers will not be liable for any damages from the operation
of this aircraft.

4.6 Transmitter Flight Control & Gain Adjustments (For ARF
Only)

We do not recommend any inexperienced users to adjust the flight control or Gain
values using the DJI NAZA Assistant software. It is a steep learning curve for these
adjustments, which we have already fine-tuned and completed for you. Improper
settings may cause the MATRIX to lose control and may result in serious damage. If
the original factory settings are altered in any way, with the exception of transmitter
calibration adjustments for ARF packages, it will automatically void the 24-hour "No
Dead on Arrival" guarantee. Dead on arrival returns are strictly checked for setting
changes and tampering. Although it can be mastered over time, the MATRIX flight
controller adjustments are quite sophisticated and complicated. Do not attempt to
change these settings until you are familiar with the setup. Please go to online forums
to learn about the flight control settings, as we do not provide any technical support
for these settings.
When you have purchased the ready to fly unit, there are 3 control modes which we
have setup on your flight controller and transmitter, GPS and ATTITUDE and
MANUAL. GPS Mode has the best auto stabilization and ability to perform GPS
Lock, making the aircraft very easy to fly, which is more appropriate for videographic
and photographic applications. Attitude Mode has some auto stabilization and ability
to perform altitude hold and makes the aircraft easier to fly, which is also suitable for
videography and photography applications. Manual Mode is suited for experienced
pilots to gain more manual control in adverse. Do not switch to the MANUAL mode
if you are a beginner.

MATRIX with GPS: The three modes can be switched during flight by toggling the
MIX switch on top of your radio. In the ready to fly MATRIX, we have set this
switch on your radio to GPS MODE when it is toggle forward and ATTITUDE
MODE when it is toggled middle and MANUAL MODE when it is toggled
backward. Before takeoff, please make sure all the front panel switches on your
transmitter are flipped forward and all switches such as the flight mode/hold switches
on the side panel are pushed down.

   30
Turbo Ace MATRIX

The basic gain and attitude gain values of the MATRIX can be adjusted in the
AUTOPILOT section when you run the DJI NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE. The
default setting for BASIC GAIN is Pitch set to 130%, Roll set to 120%, Yaw set to
90% and Vertical set to 120% and ATTITUDE GAIN is Pitch set to 100% and Roll
set to 100% (Warning: BASIC GAIN should never be set lower than 90%). Again, it
is very important to remember to tie down the aircraft and remove all the propellers
when you are programming the fight controller with the supplied Programming
USB-MicroUSB cable. Failure to do so may cause accidental motor start up with
incorrect values entered and may result in serious injury. Always remember to tie
down the MATRIX to a bench for test flights after you have changed any settings. (If
the motor does not spin after perform the CSC, please re-calibrate/perform the
Command Sticks Calibration).

ELECTRONICS SETUP & ADJUSTMENT for
Spektrum DX 8 Transmitter

If you have purchased an RTF package, please skip Section 4.1 through 4.5
because all settings are already complete and your MATRIX and transmitter have
been paired and test flown as a set. Unless you are familiar with the settings, any
changes might override the factory's setting and disable the aircraft, affecting its
performance and flight reliability.

If you have purchased an ARF package, you must complete Section 4.1 ESC
Programming and Section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration. MATRIX ESCs needs to
reprogram independently. Also, in order for a flight controller to work properly, your
specific transmitter has to be calibrated to work with each new MATRIX. Crashes
will be imminent if you skip these one-time procedures to match a MATRIX with a
transmitter.

Turbo Ace MATRIX

    (1) IMPORTANT: Remove all 4 propellers from the motors for safety.
    (2) Double check to make sure all ESC connectors are marked/labeled (#1

           through #4 matching the connectors on the flight controller #1 through #4)
           so that you will be able to keep track of the corresponding connectors when
           you need to put them back later.
    (3) Disconnect all 4 ESC connectors from the NAZA flight controller so they
           may not interfere with each other's programming.
    (4) Move the throttle stick all the way down. Now turn on the transmitter.
    (5) Disconnect X3 on NAZA flight controller and plug into AUX 1 on the
           receiver.
    (6) Insert one of the labeled ESC connectors into the receiver's throttle channel
           port while watching for the correct polarity. Black/dark brown wires are
           usually on the edge of the receiver. Please verify polarity in your receiver
           manual if you are not using the stock receiver. (Make sure the Receiver and
           Transmitter radio are bound)
    (7) Move the throttle stick all the way up.
    (8) Within 3 seconds, connect the battery to the MATRIX's battery plug (The
           MATRIX battery plug is still connected to all 4 ESCs but only one ESC
           should be connected to the receiver at a time.)
    (9) When the ESC makes 1 beeping sounds, immediately move the throttle stick
           all the way down. The ESC will then make 2 beeping. (If you did not hear
           the 1 beeping sounds when entering programming mode or you did not hear
           2 beeping after the ESC have completed its programming then you need to
           move throttle all the way down and disconnect the battery from the
           MATRIX battery plug and repeat from step #6 to #9 for the ESC.) If you did
           not experience any problems, then you have completed programming on this
           ESC which now retains the high and low end point data in its memory.
           Disconnect the battery from the MATRIX's battery connector then
           disconnect the ESC connector from the receiver.
    (10) Repeat this process for each ESC from Step#6 through Step#9. Please make
           sure you have programmed all 4 ESCs by starting from the #1 labeled ESC
           and finishing with #4 labeled ESC. Your transmitter power should remain in
           the power on position throughout the entire process of programming all 4
           ESCs.
    (11) After you have successfully re-programmed all 4 ESCs, unplug the battery
           from the MATRIX battery plug. Insert the 4 ESC connectors, labeled #1
           through #4 back to corresponding M1 through M4 ports on your NAZA

          on Spektrum DX8 Transmitter

Setting the GPS, Attitude and Manual Mode on the Flap Switch on MATRIX:

    (1) The NAZA Assistant screen should show a Control Mode Switch with GPS |
         Fail Safe | A | Fail Safe | M. (The "GPS" represent the GPS Mode, the "A"
         represent "Attitude Mode" and the "M" represent "Manual Mode".) You need
         a 3 position switch for the Control Mode Switch. For example: When using
         Spektrum DX8 and AR8000, the Control Mode Switch is assigned to the Flap
         switch on the transmitter. This is done by connecting the Receiver's AUX1
         channel to the Flight Controller's "U" channel (See FIGURE 4.2). Hold down
         roller while turning on the Spektrum DX8scroll down to "Switch
         Select"scroll down to "Flap" press rollerchange to "AUX 1" (If you
         cannot find Flap in the list, you will need to change the model type to
         "Airplane", in order for "Flap" to show up in the selection.

    (2) Now you need to make sure when the Flap Switch is flipped forward (away
         from you) the switch will change the flight controller to "GPS Mode". If the
         Control Mode Switch (See FIGURE 4.2 bottom) slider is closer to "M" or "A",

   36

         Basic Gain and Attitude Gain should never set to lower than 100%, otherwise
         crash might result.
    (2) ENHANCED FAILED-SAFE METHODS. (GPS module is required.)
         Recommended setting for enhanced failed-safe methods is to set it to
         GO-HOME and LANDING. (Please refer to DJI NAZA User Manual's page
         21 for enhanced failsafe methods.)
    (3) INTELLIGENT ORIENTATION CONTROL (IOC): (GPS module is
         required.) Check the box next to "3. Intelligent Orientation Control". If GPS is
         installed, the settings for Spektrum DX 8 and AR8000 as follows. Assign the
         intelligent orientation control to the F MODE Switch on the transmitter,
         connecting the Receiver's Gear channel to the Flight Controller's "X2"
         channel (See FIGURE 4.2). Hold the roller while turning on the Spektrum
         DX8scroll down to "Switch Select"scroll to "Gear" change to
         "Inh"scroll to "F MODE" change to "Gear".
    (4) Now you need to make sure when the F MODE Switch is flipped forward
         (toward the ground) the switch will change the Intelligent Orientation Control
         to "Off". If the slider is closer to "Course Lock" or "Home Lock", then the
         Intelligent Orientation Control Switch slider is in the wrong position. To bring
         the slider closer to "Off". Turn on transmitterclick on rollerscroll to
         "Servo Setup"scroll to "Travel", click on roller, which will have a flashing
         box scroll down to "Reverse"scroll down to "Throttle" and change to
         "Gear"scroll down to NOR & REV to reverse your Channel Gear setting to
         "REV" (which is now set to your F MODE Switch setting). This change will
         bring the Intelligent Orientation Control Switch slider closer to "Off".
    (5) Move your F MODE Switch to the middle position to set the midpoints for the
         middle position first. If the "Course Lock" segment turns blue please skip to
         Step #4.
    (6) If the "Course Lock" segment does not turn blue, click on rollerscroll to
         "Servo Setup"scroll to "Travel" and change to "subtrim"scroll down to
         "Throttle" and change it to "Gear"scroll down to "0"adjust the value until
         "Course Lock" segment turns blue.
    (7) Flip the F MODE Switch forward (toward the ground). If the "Off" segment
         turns blue then skip to Step #6.
    (8) If the "Off" segment does not turn blue, click on rollerscroll to "Servo
         Setup"scroll to "Travel"scroll down to "Throttle" and change it to
         "Gear"scroll down and adjust the value until "Off" segment turns blue.

Setting up MATRIX to ensure a smooth flight with GPS or Attitude mode

To ensure the smooth flight of your Turbo Ace MATRIX, please make sure that you
setup and fly the MATRIX in GPS or Attitude mode. In order for GPS or Attitude
mode to function, first it is important to make sure the flap switch on your radio is all
the way forward. Please refer to Section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration. If you own a
Spektrum radio such as the DX8, you will need to reverse the gear channel in your
radio so that when you flip the gear switch forward, it enables GPS or Attitude Mode.
If you are experiencing difficulties in handling the aircraft, it may be because it is not
in GPS or Attitude Mode.

You may skip the following setup instructions if you have purchased the Turbo Ace
MATRIX with a transmitter radio, as we have already completed all the setup for you.
If you have purchased a MATRIX without a radio, please see the following to make
sure your radio is setup correctly.

Setting up and checking Turbo Ace MATRIX flight mode for GPS or Attitude
Mode.

Plug in a 3 pin cable connector to the "INPUT" channel U of the NAZA flight
controller. Connect the other end of the cable to the AUX 1 output on your receiver
with the brown wire closest to the edge of the receiver casing (If you have a receiver
other than a Walkera, Devention or Spektrum, please check your receiver manual for
polarity).

MATRIX with GPS module (Assign AUX 1 to 3 position toggle switch, WOW
default Flap switch for Spektrum DX 8):
Hold down roller while turning on the Spektrum DX8scroll down to "Switch
Select"scroll down to "Flap" press rollerchange to "AUX 1" (If you cannot find
Flap in the list, you will need to change the model type to "Airplane", in order for
"Flap" to show up in the selection. This means that every time the Flap switch is
flipped forward on your radio, it will toggle the AUX 1 output of the receiver and tell
the controller to perform GPS Mode. For Spektrum radio, you will need to change
from normal to reverse on the AUX 1 channel in your radio so that when you flip the
Flap switch forward on the radio, you are activating the GPS mode. The reason to
setup the radio this way is to ensure everything is in the correct default mode when all
the switches on your radio are all the way forward (away from you). You can use the

   41
Turbo Ace MATRIX

NAZA Assistant Software to double check the Flap switch operation after you have
completed the above setup.

Turn on your transmitter radio (Warning: Always tie down the MATRIX and remove
all propellers when you perform any setting changes to the transmitter or NAZA
Assistant Software. Failure to do so may cause serious issues, as the MATRIX motor
may start up if an incorrect value is entered). Connect the provided Programming
USB-to-Micro USB cable from your PC computer's USB port (XP or WIN7) to
Micro USB port on the MATRIX communication port (on the LED side panel of the
MATRIX). Please connect this cable after the transmitter is bound to the receiver.

Double click on the NaZaInstaller.exe located in the provided 8GB USB flash drive to
install the NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE

After completion of the installation of the NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE, double
click on the application file named NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE. Wait for the
program to start up.

Select the TX Calibration tab at the left column of the screen.

MATRIX with GPS
You will see the 5 mode tabs: GPS, Fail Safe, A, Fail Safe, M. When you flip the Flap
switch on your radio, you will see the selection flipping between GPS and A and M.
When the Flap switch is flipped forward, you will see GPS is selected which enables
GPS Mode. The GPS Mode is the mode you should be using to fly your MATRIX. M
mode has no stabilization and will make it very difficult to operate the aircraft.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that the Flap switch on your radio is in the
forward/middle position before taking off and during the entire flight. (Please refer to
section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration if GPS and A and M mode do not turn blue on the
screen when you flip the Flap switch).

4.5 Transmitter Settings (For ARF Only)

    (1) Aircraft Mode: Fixed-wing airplane mode. Do not use helicopter mode
    (2) Rudder: 0% to 100% with No Mixing
    (3) Curve: Channel 1, 2, 3 & 4 all set to zero
    (4) Gyro: Fine tune to maximize stability

   42
Turbo Ace MATRIX

    (5) Move both throttle stick and throttle trim by looking at the LCD screen to the
          middle position- Very important, otherwise motors will not start

    (6) Use transmitter rudder trim to adjust heading (yaw) (will require recalibration
          if rudder is adjusted via trim and or subtrim is used)

    (7) For added stability on the MATRIX, you may choose to set the dual rate to
          55%

Please double check all settings, tie down the MATRIX to a bench, and test fly it to
check the settings. Some transmitters use random bind, which means you have to plug
in the battery to the MATRIX within 2-3 seconds after the radio is turned on. Please
observe the LED light located at the back of the MATRIX cover (Please refer to
Section 5.3 LED light description). Most receivers flash before binding and remain
solid after binding, so please make sure your receiver has been properly bound to your
transmitter. Do not launch the MATRIX on its maiden flight until all operations are
confirmed as normal, especially after shipping. Tie it down to a bench for a preflight
check. Failure to do so may cause serious damage to the MATRIX and/or people
around it. Factories and dealers will not be liable for any damages from the operation
of this aircraft.

4.6 Transmitter Flight Control & Gain Adjustments (For ARF
Only)

We do not recommend any inexperienced users to adjust the flight control or Gain
values using the DJI NAZA Assistant software. It is a steep learning curve for these
adjustments, which we have already fine-tuned and completed for you. Improper
settings may cause the MATRIX to lose control and may result in serious damage. If
the original factory settings are altered in any way, with the exception of transmitter
calibration adjustments for ARF packages, it will automatically void the 24-hour "No
Dead on Arrival" guarantee. Dead on arrival returns are strictly checked for setting
changes and tampering. Although it can be mastered over time, the MATRIX flight
controller adjustments are quite sophisticated and complicated. Do not attempt to
change these settings until you are familiar with the setup. Please go to online forums
to learn about the flight control settings, as we do not provide any technical support
for these settings.
When you have purchased the ready to fly unit, there are 3 control modes which we
have setup on your flight controller and transmitter, GPS and ATTITUDE and
MANUAL. GPS Mode has the best auto stabilization and ability to perform GPS
Lock, making the aircraft very easy to fly, which is more appropriate for videographic

   43
Turbo Ace MATRIX

and photographic applications. Attitude Mode has some auto stabilization and ability
to perform attitude hold and makes the aircraft easier to fly, which is also suitable for
videographic and photographic applications. Manual Mode is suited for experienced
pilots to gain more manual control in adverse. Do not switch to the MANUAL mode
if you are a beginner.

MATRIX with GPS: The three modes can be switched during flight by toggling the
Flap switch on top of your radio. In the ready to fly MATRIX, we have set this switch
on your radio to GPS MODE when it is toggle forward and ATTITUDE MODE when
it is toggled middle and MANUAL MODE when it is toggled backward. Before
takeoff, please make sure all the front panel switches on your transmitter are flipped
forward and all switches such as the flight mode/hold switches on the side panel are
pushed down.

The basic gain and attitude gain values of the MATRIX can be adjusted in the
AUTOPILOT section when you run the DJI NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE. The
default setting for BASIC GAIN is Pitch set to 130%, Roll set to 120%, Yaw set to
90% and Vertical set to 120% and ATTITUDE GAIN is Pitch set to 100% and Roll
set to 100% (Warning: BASIC GAIN should never be set lower than 90%). Again,
it is very important to remember to tie down the aircraft and remove all the propellers
when you are programming the fight controller with the supplied Programming
USB-MicroUSB cable. Failure to do so may cause accidental motor start up with
incorrect values entered and may result in serious injury. Always remember to tie
down the MATRIX to a bench for test flights after you have changed any settings. (If
the motor does not spin while perform the CSC, please re-calibrate/perform the
Command Sticks Calibration).

ELECTRONICS SETUP & ADJUSTMENT for
Futaba 14SG Transmitter

If you have purchased an RTF package, please skip Section 4.1 through 4.5
because all settings are already complete and your MATRIX and transmitter have
been paired and test flown as a set. Unless you are familiar with the settings, any
changes might override the factory's setting and disable the aircraft, affecting its
performance and flight reliability.

If you have purchased an ARF package, you must complete Section 4.1 ESC
Programming and Section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration. MATRIX ESCs needs to
reprogram independently. Also, in order for a flight controller to work properly, your
specific transmitter has to be calibrated to work with each new MATRIX. Crashes
will be imminent if you skip these one-time procedures to match a MATRIX with a
transmitter.

ESCs have been re-programmed. Please follow the steps below very carefully, as they
will only take a few minutes.

Turbo Ace MATRIX

    (1) Very important: Remove all 4 propellers from the motors for safety.
    (2) Double check to make sure all ESC connectors are marked/labeled (#1

           through #4 matching the connectors on the flight controller #1 through #4)
           so that you will be able to keep track of the corresponding connectors when
           you need to put them back later.
    (3) Disconnect all 4 ESC connectors from the NAZA flight controller so they
           may not interfere with each other's programming.
    (4) Move the throttle stick all the way down. Now turn on the transmitter.
    (5) Disconnect X3 on NAZA flight controller and plug into port 8 on the
           receiver.
    (6) Turn on Futaba radiodouble tap "LNK"go to "Reverse"go to THR
           and set it to "REV"
    (7) Insert one of the labeled ESC connectors into the receiver's throttle channel
           (wow default port 3) port while watching for the correct polarity. Black/dark
           brown wires are usually on the edge of the receiver. Please verify polarity in
           your receiver manual if you are not using the stock receiver.
    (8) Move the throttle stick all the way up.
    (9) Within 3 seconds, connect the battery to the MATRIX's battery plug (The
           MATRIX battery plug is still connected to all 4 ESCs but only one ESC
           should be connected to the receiver at a time.)
    (10) When the ESC makes 1 beeping sounds, immediately move the throttle stick
           all the way down. The ESC will then make 2 beeping. (If you did not hear
           the 1 beeping sounds when entering programming mode or you did not hear
           2 beeping after the ESC have completed its programming then you need to
           move throttle all the way down and disconnect the battery from the
           MATRIX battery plug and repeat from step #7 to #10 for the ESC.) If you
           did not experience any problems, then you have completed programming on
           this ESC which now retains the high and low end point data in its memory.
           Disconnect the battery from the MATRIX's battery connector then
           disconnect the ESC connector from the receiver.
    (11) Repeat this process for each ESC from Step#7 through Step#10. Please
           make sure you have programmed all 4 ESCs by starting from the #1 labeled
           ESC and finishing with #4 labeled ESC. Your transmitter power should
           remain in the power on position throughout the entire process of
           programming all 4 ESCs.
    (12) After you have successfully re-programmed all 4 ESCs, unplug the battery
           from the MATRIX battery plug

   47

         (13) Now reverse the throttle back to normal on Futaba radiodouble tap
               "LNK"go to "Reverse"go to THR and set it to "NORM"

         (14) Insert the 4 ESC connectors, labeled #1 through #4 back to corresponding
               M1 through M4 ports on your NAZA flight controller. The black/dark
               brown wire (-) for each of the ESC connectors are closest to the red NAZA
               label of the flight controller.

    (15) CONTROL MODE SWITCH: (Please see Section 4.7 MATRIX Wiring

         Connection Chart)
          Setting the GPS Attitude and Attitude and Manual Mode on the SB Switch
          on Futaba 14SG Transmitter:

Setting the GPS, Attitude and Manual Mode on the Mix Switch on MATRIX:
    (1) The NAZA Assistant screen should show a Control Mode Switch with GPS |
         Fail Safe | A | Fail Safe | M. (The "GPS" represent the GPS Mode, the "A"
         represent "Attitude Mode" and the "M" represent "Manual Mode".) You need
         a 3 position switch for the Control Mode Switch. For example: When using
         Futaba 14SG and R7008SB, the Control Mode Switch is assigned to the SB
         switch on the transmitter. This is done by connecting the Receiver's 5 channel
         to the Flight Controller's "U" channel (See FIGURE 4.2). Turn on the Futaba

         14SG, double tap "LNK"scroll down to "Function" press "RTN"scroll
         down to channel 5Change CTRL to "SB".
    (2) Now you need to make sure when the SB Switch is flipped forward (away
         from you) the switch will change the flight controller to "GPS Mode". If the
         Control Mode Switch (See FIGURE 4.2 bottom) slider is closer to "M" or "A",
         then the Control Mode Switch slider is in the wrong position. To bring the
         slider closer to "GPS", double tap "LNK"scroll down to "REVERSE"
         scroll down to Channel 5tap "RTN" and reverse your Channel 5 setting to
         "REV" (which is now set to your SB Switch setting). This change will bring
         the Control Mode Switch slider closer to "GPS".
    (3) Transmitter can be turn on and off to bind and re-bind, which will make fail
         safe testing easier. To setup Fail-Safe, double tap "LNK"scroll down to
         "END POINT"scroll down to Channel 5adjust travel value until the
         failsafe turn bluedouble tap "LNK"scroll down to "FAIL SAFE"scroll
         down to Channel 5scroll to F/S and change to "F/S"scroll to "POS" and
         hold "RTN" for 1 sec, it will set the value for failsafe itself.
    (4) Move your SB Switch to the middle position to set the sub trim for the middle
         position first. If the "A" segment turns blue please skip to Step #6.
    (5) If the "A" segment does not turn blue, double tap "LNK"scroll down to
         "SUB-TRIM"scroll down to Channel 5change the value until "A"
         segment turns blue.
    (6) Flip the SB Switch forward (away from you). If the "GPS" segment turns blue
         then skip to Step #8.
    (7) If the "GPS" segment does not turn blue, double tap "LNK"scroll down to
         "ENDPOINT"scroll down to Channel 5find the travel value and tap
         "RTN"value will flash and you can change the value until "GPS" segment
         turns blue.
    (8) Flip the SB Switch backward (towards you). If the "M" segment turns blue
         then skip to Section 4.2.11.
    (9) If the "M" segment does not turn blue, double tap "LNK"scroll down to
         "ENDPOINT"scroll down to Channel 5 find the travel value and tap
         "RTN"value will flash and you can change the value until "M" segment
         turns blue. Make sure to test the failsafe by turn off your transmitter and the
         slider should move to failsafe and turn blue.

    (1) BASIC PARAMETERS: Recommend setting for Pitch set to 130%, Roll set
         to 120%, Yaw set to 90% and Vertical set to 120% and ATTITUDE GAIN is
         Pitch set to 100% and Roll set to 100%. REMOTE ADJUST is set to INH.
         Basic Gain and Attitude Gain should never set to lower than 100%, otherwise
         crash might result.

    (2) ENHANCED FAILED-SAFE METHODS. (GPS module is required.)
         Recommended setting for enhanced failed-safe methods is to set it to
         GO-HOME and LANDING. (Please refer to DJI NAZA User Manual's page
         21 for enhanced failed-safe methods.)

    (3) INTELLIGENT ORIENTATION CONTROL (IOC): (GPS module is
         required.) Check the box next to "3. Intelligent Orientation Control". If GPS is
         installed, the settings for Futaba 14SG and R7008SB are as follows. Assign
         the intelligent orientation control to the SE Switch on the transmitter,
         connecting the Receiver's 6 channel to the Flight Controller's "X2" channel
         (See FIGURE 4.2). Turn on the Futaba 14SG, double tap "LNK"scroll
         down to "Function" press "RTN"scroll down to channel 6Change CTRL
         to "SE".

    (4) Now you need to make sure when the SE Switch is flipped forward (toward
         the ground) the switch will change the Intelligent Orientation Control to "Off".
         If the slider is closer to "Course Lock" or "Home Lock", then the Intelligent
         Orientation Control Switch slider is in the wrong position. To bring the slider
         closer to "Off",
         double tap "LNK"scroll down to "REVERSE" scroll down to Channel
         6tap "RTN" and reverse your Channel 6 setting to "REV" (which is now set
         to your SE Switch setting). This change will bring the Intelligent Orientation
         Control Switch slider closer to "Off".

    (5) Move your SE Switch to the middle position to set the midpoints for the
         middle position first. If the "Course Lock" segment turns blue please skip to
         Step #4.

    (6) If the "Course Lock" segment does not turn blue, double tap "LNK"scroll
         down to "SUB TRIM"scroll down to Channel 6adjust the value until
         "Course Lock" segment turns blue.

    (7) Flip the SE Switch forward (toward the ground). If the "Off" segment turns
         blue then skip to Step #6.

Setting up MATRIX to ensure a smooth flight with GPS or Attitude mode

To ensure the smooth flight of your Turbo Ace MATRIX, please make sure that you
setup and fly the MATRIX in GPS or Attitude mode. In order for GPS or Attitude
mode to function, first it is important to make sure the mix switch on your radio is all
the way forward. Please refer to Section 4.2 Transmitter Calibration. If you are

   54
Turbo Ace MATRIX

experiencing difficulties in handling the aircraft, it may be because it is not in GPS or
Attitude Mode.

You may skip the following setup instructions if you have purchased the Turbo Ace
MATRIX with a transmitter radio, as we have already completed all the setup for you.
If you have purchased a MATRIX without a radio, please see the following to make
sure your radio is setup correctly.

Setting up and checking Turbo Ace MATRIX flight mode for GPS or Attitude
Mode.

Plug in a 3 pin cable connector to the "INPUT" channel U of the NAZA flight
controller. Connect the other end of the cable to the Channel 5 output on your receiver
with the brown wire closest to the edge of the receiver casing (If you have a receiver
other than a Walkera, Devention or Spektrum, please check your receiver manual for
polarity).

MATRIX with GPS module (Assign Channel 5 to 3 position toggle switch, WOW
default SB switch for Futaba 14SG):
Turn on the Futaba 14SG, double tap "LNK"scroll down to "Function" press
"RTN"scroll down to channel 5Change CTRL to "SB". This means that every
time the SB switch is flipped forward on your radio, it will toggle the Channel 5
output of the receiver and tell the controller to perform GPS Mode. For Futaba radio,
you might need to change from normal to reverse on the AUX 1 channel in your radio
so that when you flip the SB switch forward on the radio, you are activating the GPS
mode. The reason to setup the radio this way is to ensure everything is in the correct
default mode when all the switches on your radio are all the way forward (away from
you). You can use the NAZA Assistant Software to double check the SB switch
operation after you have completed the above setup.

Turn on your transmitter radio (Warning: Always tie down the MATRIX and remove
all propellers when you perform any setting changes to the transmitter or NAZA
Assistant Software. Failure to do so may cause serious issues, as the MATRIX motor
may start up if an incorrect value is entered). Connect the provided Programming
USB-to-Micro USB cable from your PC computer's USB port (XP or WIN7) to
Micro USB port on the MATRIX communication port (on the LED side panel of the
MATRIX). Please connect this cable after the transmitter is bound to the receiver.

   55
Turbo Ace MATRIX

Double click on the NaZaInstaller.exe located in the provided 8GB USB flash drive to
install the NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE

After completion of the installation of the NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE, double
click on the application file named NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE. Wait for the
program to start up.

Select the TX Calibration tab at the left column of the screen.

MATRIX with GPS
You will see the 5 mode tabs: GPS, Fail Safe, A, Fail Safe, M. When you flip the SB
switch on your radio, you will see the selection flipping between GPS and A and M.
When the SB switch is flipped forward, you will see GPS is selected which enables
GPS Mode. The GPS Mode is the mode you should be using to fly your MATRIX. M
mode has no stabilization and will make it very difficult to operate the aircraft.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that the SB switch on your radio is in the forward/middle
position before taking off and during the entire flight. (Please refer to section 4.2
Transmitter Calibration if GPS and A and M mode do not turn blue on the screen
when you flip the Flap switch).

4.5 Transmitter Settings (For ARF Only)

    (1) Aircraft Mode: Fixed-wing airplane mode. Do not use helicopter mode
    (2) Rudder: 0% to 100% with No Mixing
    (3) Curve: Channel 1, 2, 3 & 4 all set to zero
    (4) Gyro: Fine tune to maximize stability
    (5) Move both throttle stick and throttle trim by looking at the LCD screen to the

          middle position- Very important, otherwise motors will not start
    (6) Use transmitter rudder trim to adjust heading (yaw)
    (7) For added stability on the MATRIX, you may choose to set the dual rate to

          55%

Please double check all settings, tie down the MATRIX to a bench, and test fly it to
check the settings. Some transmitters use random bind, which means you have to plug
in the battery to the MATRIX within 2-3 seconds after the radio is turned on. Please
observe the LED light located at the back of the MATRIX cover (Please refer to
Section 5.3 LED light description). Most receivers flash before binding and remain
solid after binding, so please make sure your receiver has been properly bound to your

   56
Turbo Ace MATRIX

transmitter. Do not launch the MATRIX on its maiden flight until all operations are
confirmed as normal, especially after shipping. Tie it down to a bench for a preflight
check. Failure to do so may cause serious damage to the MATRIX and/or people
around it. Factories and dealers will not be liable for any damages from the operation
of this aircraft.

4.6 Transmitter Flight Control & Gain Adjustments (For ARF
Only)

We do not recommend any inexperienced users to adjust the flight control or Gain
values using the DJI NAZA Assistant software. It is a steep learning curve for these
adjustments, which we have already fine-tuned and completed for you. Improper
settings may cause the MATRIX to lose control and may result in serious damage. If
the original factory settings are altered in any way, with the exception of transmitter
calibration adjustments for ARF packages, it will automatically void the 24-hour "No
Dead on Arrival" guarantee. Dead on arrival returns are strictly checked for setting
changes and tampering. Although it can be mastered over time, the MATRIX flight
controller adjustments are quite sophisticated and complicated. Do not attempt to
change these settings until you are familiar with the setup. Please go to online forums
to learn about the flight control settings, as we do not provide any technical support
for these settings.

When you have purchased the ready to fly unit, there are 3 control modes which we
have setup on your flight controller and transmitter, GPS and ATTITUDE and
MANUAL. GPS Mode has the best auto stabilization and ability to perform GPS
Lock, making the aircraft very easy to fly, which is more appropriate for videographic
and photographic applications. Attitude Mode has some auto stabilization and ability
to perform attitude hold and makes the aircraft easier to fly, which is also suitable for
videographic and photographic applications. Manual Mode is suited for experienced
pilots to gain more manual control in adverse. Do not switch to the MANUAL mode
if you are a beginner.
MATRIX with GPS: The three modes can be switched during flight by toggling the
SB switch on top of your radio. In the ready to fly MATRIX, we have set this switch
on your radio to GPS MODE when it is toggle forward and ATTITUDE MODE when
it is toggled middle and MANUAL MODE when it is toggled backward. Before
takeoff, please make sure all the front panel switches on your transmitter are flipped
forward and all switches such as the flight mode/hold switches on the side panel are
pushed down.

   57
Turbo Ace MATRIX

The basic gain and attitude gain values of the MATRIX can be adjusted in the
AUTOPILOT section when you run the DJI NAZA ASSISTANT SOFTWARE. The
default setting for BASIC GAIN is Pitch set to 130%, Roll set to 120%, Yaw set to
90% and Vertical set to 120% and ATTITUDE GAIN is Pitch set to 100% and Roll
set to 100% (Warning: BASIC GAIN should never be set lower than 90%). Again,
it is very important to remember to tie down the aircraft and remove all the propellers
when you are programming the fight controller with the supplied Programming
USB-MicroUSB cable. Failure to do so may cause accidental motor start up with
incorrect values entered and may result in serious injury. Always remember to tie
down the MATRIX to a bench for test flights after you have changed any settings. (If
the motor does not spin while perform the CSC, please re-calibrate/perform the
Command Sticks Calibration).

(1) Tie down all four arms (not the skids) of the MATRIX to a heavy fixture such
         as a table or a work bench. Make sure there is plenty of space around the
         aircraft. If you have the random binding transmitter such as the Devention 10,
         please make sure there are no other similar radios in the vicinity during the
         binding process.

(2) Prior to initiating your MATRIX, make sure it is on a water level surface and
         do not move the MATRIX before takeoff or during the binding process.
         Failure to do so will result in miscalculating of the 3-Axis gyro compensation
         and the MATRIX will not be able to operate properly.

(3) Make sure your battery is fully charged using a battery meter (about 4.1V to
         4.2V per cell on all 6 cells) Plug in the battery connector to the power input
         connector from the chassis. Do not run any LiPo battery to below 3.5V per cell
         or a total of 21.0V for the MATRIX 6 cells battery, otherwise the battery will
         be permanently damaged.

(4) After 2 seconds of initialization, the MATRIX will issue 5 consecutive "beep"
         tones.

(5) Place your transmitter flat on a table in front of you with the joystick facing
         up. Make sure all switches above the two control sticks on the transmitter are
         pushed forward and away from you and the two switches at the very top of the
         transmitter side panel is pushed down towards the table. Move the throttle
         stick (left stick) to the lowest position towards you. At this time, you do not
         need to move the directional stick (right stick), which is spring loaded and will
         always return to the middle position when released). Now you can turn your
         transmitter "ON".

(6) Wait another six seconds for 5 consecutive "beep" tones from the MATRIX,
         which indicate that binding between the receiver and the transmitter is
         complete. Before moving any controls on the transmitter, it's always good
         practice to find the solid LED light on the receiver & telemetry module to
         confirm that binding has been completed.

(7) Stay at a safe distance and execute the combination stick command (CSC) to
         start motors.

(8) Make sure Motor #1 and Motor #3 propellers are rotating in a CCW (counter
         clock wise) direction and Motor #2 and Motor #4 propellers are rotating in a
         CW (clockwise direction). As you increase the throttle, the propellers should
         speed up and vice versa.

(9) Moving the rudder stick (which also controls the throttle) to the right should
         decelerate CCW propellers (Motor #1 & Motor #3), thereby decreasing CW
         torque so the aircraft turns CCW. Moving the rudder to the left should
         decelerate CW propellers (Motor #2 & Motor #4), thereby decreasing CCW
         torque so the aircraft turns CW.

(10) Moving the directional stick to the top should decelerate the two front
         propellers (Motor #1 & Motor #2) and moving the directional stick to the
         bottom should decelerate the back propellers (Motor #3 & Motor #4). Moving
         the directional stick to the left should decelerate the left propellers (Motor #2
         & Motor #3), and moving the directional stick to the right should decelerate
         the right propellers (Motor #1 & Motor #4).

(11) Move the throttle stick to lowest position and the propeller should come to a
         stop. Unplug the battery from the copter then turn the transmitter off.

(12) Repeat above Steps #2-11 twice more so that you complete 3 rounds of 8 to 10
         minutes of tie-down flight.

5.2 Actual Flight Test & Training

(1) Pick a calm day or find a large empty indoor space. Keep all people and pets
      away from the flight test area and place the MATRIX on a level surface.

(2) Repeat Steps #2-11 under 5.1
(3) If you fly the MATRIX too close to the ground, the wash (deflected air) coming

      back up from the ground may cause significant flight instability. As with all
      propeller driven systems, you should try to keep larger aircraft at least 3 to 4 feet
      from the ground and avoid flying in a small room, which deflects air current.
      Before takeoff, you may also notice some vibration of the aircraft caused by auto
      stabilization from the deflected air. Once the aircraft lifts away from the ground,
      it will stabilize.

   60
Turbo Ace MATRIX

(4) If you are a beginner pilot, we highly recommend that you purchase a simulator
      training package or a trainer unit to practice. Though the MATRIX is equipped
      with easy to fly auto stabilization for safety, do not attempt to operate the aircraft
      without any flight experience. Always try to maintain the tail-in position (tail
      towards you) because that is the easiest orientation to keep your aircraft in
      control.

(5) As your skills improve, additional training includes flying in circles, figure 8s,
      backwards, sideways and other exercises to improve coordination.

5.5 Battery Tips

(1) Set the alarm on your transmitter radio to a safe range. Trying to extend the flight
      time when the battery is low will only put your aircraft at risk. Always check
      your battery before each flight.

(2) Unlike other rechargeable batteries, LiPo batteries can easily be damaged if you
      drain them below 3.5V per cell (6 Cells x 3.5V = 21.0V). Do not force your
      battery to continue running when it's low. Doing so will only permanently
      damage your battery.

   63
Turbo Ace MATRIX

(3) Disconnect the battery plug from the MATRIX when you are done flying. Do not
      leave your battery plugged into the MATRIX after a flight.

(4) An inexpensive battery meter with an alarm would be a smart tool to have.
      Always check each battery's charge before each flight. A fully charged battery
      should be around 4.1V to 4.2V per cell (Multiply that by 6 for a 6 cells battery).

(5) A transmitter battery is a lot more reliable and convenient than 8 "AA" batteries

      for your transmitter. With a larger capacity, longer lifespan and the desired
      voltage, the transmitter battery is also rechargeable using the same battery
      charger as the helicopter battery.

5.6 Flight Time

      Voltage warning settings for your MATRIX have been programmed
      conservatively to protect your batteries. To obtain longer flight times, on-board
      voltage must be observed during flight by using the telemetry function in your
      radio. Monitoring your batteries for maximum drain will greatly improve flight
      time but it requires knowledge of Li-Po battery power management. The rule of
      thumb is that the total operating voltage on the MATRIX cannot be drained to less
      than 21.0v total (3.5V per cell) during flight. After you have landed the MATRIX,
      the voltage reading will increase since no load is applied. The total no load voltage
      shall not be drained to less than 22.02v total (3.67V per cell) otherwise the battery
      may get damaged. Over drained batteries are not returnable, so caution must be
      used while operating Li-Po powered aircraft. Default setting for the NAZA
      Voltage Monitor:
      1. Protection SwitchON
      2. Battery Battery Type: 6S LiPo
      3. First Level Protection No Load is set to 22.8V, Loss is set to 0.6V and Loaded
      is set to 22.2V
      4. Second Level Protection No Load is set to 19.2V, Loss is set to 0.6V and
      Loaded is set to 18.6V

CAMERA MOUNT SETUP

6.1 Gyrox Brushless Gimbal Setup

First, balance the gimbal and battery on the quad by adjusting the battery position.
Battery should rest on the same plate as the gimbal mount (shock plate/battery
mounting plate). Equilibrium can be tested by holding the quad on both sides with
two fingers underneath the chassis hub cover.

Unlike servo driven gimbals, brushless gimbals require precision in order to properly
balance your camera on the mounting plate. It is important to read and follow these
installation instructions:
(1) Cameras heavier than a GoPro (0.5lb) will overload the brushless motors and

      caused them to fail. Use a camera that is equal to or lighter than a GoPro.
(2) (Skip this step if your brushless gimbal already has the GoPro fixed mount) Strap

      the camera down to the base plate of the mount. Allow the camera to move side
      to side for center of gravity adjustment. Shift the camera left or right until the
      center of gravity is obtained, then tighten the strap if needed. Do not power up
      the gimbal in the process. When the center of gravity is correct, the camera will
      stay level and will not tip easily to either side on the rolling axis of the mount.
(3) During initialization, remember that the camera must be leveled and the gimbal
      and multi-rotor cannot be handheld. Keep both perfectly still on a flat, stable
      surface. Apply power to the gimbal with a 3-cell Lipo 11.1v-12.6v(3S MAX,
      The gimbal board will short out if connected to the main power distribution
      cable.) and wait 5-10 seconds. You will notice the gimbal motors initialize and
      start leveling. The gimbal will then be ready for operation.
(4) If the center of gravity is off, the gimbal will buzz or shake. Shift the camera
      until the shaking stops.
(5) Brushless gimbals have a much quicker compensation than traditional
      servo-driven gimbal. Rough handling will cause your gimbal to malfunction. If
      this occurs, unplug the power and go through the initialization by setting it on the
      ground.

6.2 MATRIX CAMERA MOUNT SERVO CONTROL SETUP

                               Figure 6.1-1 MATRIX Camera Mount Plate and Shock Plate

IMPORTANT: Only digital servos are compatible with the Naza flight controller.
Using an analog servo will cause malfunctioning, produce loud buzzing noises and
burn up the servo. A light buzzing sound from a digital servo is, however, normal.
The MATRIX features built-in gyros for camera mount auto compensation so there is
no need to purchase separate gyros for your camera mount.
6.2.1 How to set your camera TILT (PITCH) auto compensation control for the
MATRIX-S flight controller, receiver and transmitter
Connect flight controller F2 to tilt (pitch) servo.
Connect receiver's (For Walkera Devo 10 is Aux 4, For Spektrum DX8 is Aux 3, or
Futaba 14SG is channel 7) Channel (assuming the AUX4 channel has not been
already used for flight mode control or other functions) to flight controller's X1 using
a 3 wire cable with the black ground wire closest to the edge of the flight controller
(some receivers' polarity for ground may be different, so see your receiver manual for
more details). Go to AUTOPILOT tab in DJI NAZA Assistant Software to set all
remote adjustments to INH, and go to the GIMBAL tab to click ON to enable the
gimbal manual control. Additionally, when you tilt the MATRIX forwards or
backwards, the MATRIX gyro will sense the tilt so the camera mount servo will also
automatically compensate for that by pitching the camera in the opposite direction to

   66
Turbo Ace MATRIX

compensate. Go to the GIMBAL tab in DJI NAZA Assistant Software, and go to the 3.
With Automatic Control Gain, you can increase the gain to make camera mount auto
compensation movement faster or decrease the gain to make auto compensation
movement slower. Moreover, if the camera mount is moving in the wrong direction,
you can click the button under DIRECTION, to change between "NORM" and
"REV".
For Walkera Devention 10, the AUX 4 knob can be turned to adjust the camera
mount's tilt action.

6.2.2 How to set your camera auto compensation ROLL control for the MATRIX
flight controller, receiver and transmitter

Connect flight controller F1 to roll servo. Now the servo will automatically
compensate when the MATRIX rolls. First, tie down your MATRIX before you turn
on your transmitter radio, then connect the battery to the MATRIX. Connect the
provided Programming USB cable from your PC computer's USB port (XP or WIN7)
to Micro USB port on the MATRIX communication port (on the LED side panel of
the MATRIX). Please connect this cable after the transmitter has been bound to the
receiver. Go to the GIMBAL tab to click ON to enable the gimbal manual control.
Additionally, when you roll the MATRIX left or right, the MATRIX gyro will sense
the roll so the camera mount servo will also automatically compensate for that by
rolling the camera mount in the opposite direction to compensate. Go to the GIMBAL
tab in DJI NAZA Assistant Software, and go to the 3. With Automatic Control Gain,
you can increase the gain to make camera mount auto compensation movement faster
or decrease the gain to make auto compensation movement slower. Moreover, if the
camera mount is moving in the wrong direction, you can click the button under
DIRECTION, to change between "NORM" and "REV".

6.2.3 How to adjust the compensation gain and servo direction reversal in the DJI
NAZA Assistant Software

Remove all 4 propellers for safety- please do not skip this or serious accidents may
occur. Turn on your radio and connect the battery (plugging in the main battery to the
MATRIX is required to provide power to the gimbal servos) to the MATRIX. Make
sure your transmitter throttle stick is all the way down before binding. For safety,
please be very cautious to avoid moving the throttle stick of your transmitter during
the entire process. Connect the USB cable from your PC to the micro USB port of the
MATRIX communication port (on the LED side panel of the MATRIX). Double click

   67
Turbo Ace MATRIX

on the application DJI NAZA Assistant Software. At first launch of the application,
the language may appear in Chinese- click on this Chinese tab anyway and change the
language to English by clicking on the tab on the top of the screen. Sometimes when
you launch an application and you don't see anything, it may be because the screen is
hidden behind the previous application such as Windows Explorer, which you may
have launched previously. Click on the "Gimbal" tab on the left panel of the screen.
Now test the gimbal on the MATRIX by tilting it firmly on your hands. When the
MATRIX tilts up the gimbal should travel and compensate in the opposite direction
by tilting down. The camera should continue to lock on the subject you are shooting.
If, however, the gimbal compensates in the same direction, go to 3. Automatic
Control Gain under direction and click the box "NORM" or "REV" on the screen to
reverse the servo travel. Test the gimbal compensation for roll action, and if
compensation is in the same direction, simply click the box below direction for roll
"NORM" or "REV". Now test the gimbal for the amount of compensation. Note that
the factory default compensation for tilt is set at 0.00. Each gimbal servo travels
differently so adjustments may be required. If the gimbal compensation is too much or
too little, you may adjust both the gimbal tilt and gimbal roll value by entering the
number on the gain. When you have completed the settings, click on "Write" at the
top of the program. You must click on "Write," otherwise the data might not be
loaded onto the MATRIX controller.

6.3 Flight Control Adjustment for Auto-Stabilization

Over attitude gain control may affect the vibration on the MATRIX. This type of
vibration is particularly noticeable during climb out when there is a violent shake
during acceleration. Also, any drastic weight change, such as loading on a DSLR
camera, may require the attitude control gain adjustment. To access the adjustment,
open the DJI NAZA Assistant Software, which is contained in the included flash
drive. Connect the MATRIX to a Windows based PC with Windows 8 or Windows 7
or XP (For Windows to run this application, a current DirectX driver may be
required). Upon initial application launch, you may see unreadable Chinese language.
Just click on the top tab, and change language to English. Select the "AUTOPILOT"
tab on the left column of the screen. Adjust the Basic Gain and Attitude Control Gain
for Pitch, Roll, Yaw and Vertical by increments of 10. It is important that you click
the "WRITE" tab, otherwise the new settings will not be stored in the flight controller.

   68
Turbo Ace MATRIX

6.4 Basic Gain and Attitude Gain Adjustment for Stabilization

Recommended settings for BASIC GAIN is Pitch set to 130%, Roll set to 120%, Yaw
set to 90% and Vertical set to 120%, and for ATTITUDE GAIN is Pitch set to 100%
and Roll set to 100%. Warning: BASIC GAIN needs to be set at a minimum of 90%.
If your MATRIX is not as stable after a heavy camera or camera mount is installed,
you should increase the BASIC GAIN and ATTITUDE GAIN by 15%-25% each time
and re-test the performance of your MATRIX. Please refer to 4.6.3 to adjust your
BASIC GAIN and ATTITUDE GAIN.

Assumptions on DJI NAZA FC design:
Assume aircraft flies stable as a general rule, which means FC outputs control signal
to motor when it finds frame tilts for a stabilization recovery. We consider this
non-RC tilt as an error.
According to the previous flight states, on the condition that vibration occurs during
tilt, this can still be regarded as the stable state.
When the aircraft tilts to a certain direction, it will engender a tendency which could
be reinforced.
Notice: Assumption 2 is not contradictory to Assumption 3.
We haven't built MATRIX mathematical modeling, which needs adjustments in Gain
Tuning through personal sense. It is suggested that users grab the aircraft on the
ground when tuning, which takes patience and skill. You will only get a
comparatively ideal value after hours of tuning. When setting Basic Gain and
Attitude Gain Parameters, please exercise caution and always have the MATRIX
tied down to a bench.

MAINTENANCE & REPAIR

7.1 Replacing Motors (For Repairs Only)

To simplify motor replacement, the MATRIX motors can be disconnected once you

remove the bottom frame, and motor wire is connected to ESC. Please remember
to reapply Loctite when putting bolts and screws back.

(1) Make sure your battery is disconnected from the MATRIX.
(2) Identify the motor that needs to be replaced and put a marking sticker on the

      corresponding extension arm so you can identify which motor you are working
      on.
(3) Remove the bolts that secure the motor mount.
(4) Unscrew all the bottom bolts to dismount the bottom.
(5) Disconnect the three connectors for the old motor from the ESC and remove the
      old motor from the extension arm. All brushless motor wires have 3 wires. Prior
      to disconnection, please mark down the color of motor wire and the motor you're
      replacing.
(6) Feed the three motor connectors through the extension arm and connect three
      motor connectors to the ESC.
(7) Remount the new motor on the end of the extension arm using the bolts with
      Loctite.

FIXED ID BIND for Walkera Devo 10 transmitter

Setting up a Fixed ID bind between your MATRIX and Devo 10

IMPORTANT: When adjusting the settings of the MATRIX (while it is turned on),
make sure that the propellers are removed and that the unit is securely tied down
before proceeding in order to avoid any accidental flight.

Please ignore this step if you have a Futaba or Spektrum transmitter/receiver

         Start by plugging in the Walkera bind plug (comes with receiver, if purchased)
to the "batt." port on the receiver, followed by plugging in the battery for the
MATRIX. The red light on the receiver should blink rapidly. Wait for the MATRIX's
connection tune to finish playing, then proceed by unplugging the bind plug (the red
light should now blink at a slower pace); followed by the battery.
NOTE: The transmitter does not need to be on for this step.

Setting up the Fixed ID on your transmitter

      First go through the steps to bind the MATRIX to your transmitter (1. Turn on
the transmitter 2. Plug the battery into the MATRIX 3. The MATRIX is bound when
the red light on the receiver turns solid). From the home screen of the transmitter, go
into the Main Menu screen and select: Model Menu  Fixed ID  turn Status to
"On" set the ID code to your desired value and hit enter. You will see a little menu
saying "ID Match." After the menu disappears, unplug the MATRIX battery,
followed by the transmitter and you're done!
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS turn off the transmitter AFTER unplugging the
MATRIX). Now your MATRIX will only bind with only the transmitter that you have
set up the fixed ID bind with.
