                                                           Exemption No. 11396
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0163

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Counsel for Owlcam, LLC
Antonelli Law
100 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letters dated January 22 and April 2, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Owlcam, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct aerial photography and videography for real estate in rural areas in the state
of Hawai'i.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Owlcam, LLC. is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
                                                                                                                 3

extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Owlcam, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
         permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
                                                                                                            4

    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

C.F.R. 91.407; 14 C.F.R. 409; and 14 C.F.R. 91.417.

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act) and
14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law's Drone/UAS Practice Group, on behalf of Owlcam, LLC
("Owlcam"), an operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUAS") equipped to film and
photograph real estate in rural areas in the state of Hawai'i, applies for an exemption from the
listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of its sUASs, so long

as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be

established by the FAA as required by Section 333.

Approval of exemptions for Owlcam will allow commercial operations of sUASs in rural, remote,
low density areas on the Hawai'ian Islands, for the purpose of real estate photography and
videography. The pilot in command (PIC) is a certified commercial and instrument-rated
helicopter pilot with more than 6,100 hours of flight time, and has a second class medical
certificate. The requested exemption should be granted because the proposed operations of the DJI
Phantom 2, a small UASs that weighs 2.9 lbs., inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the
strict conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended,
while still allowing commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the exemption are
far safer than conventional operations conducted with manned helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft
weighing thousands of pounds, containing highly flammable fuel, and operating in close proximity
to the ground and people, as a similar UAS has been previously approved in Exemption No. 11138,
Douglas Trudeau, Realtor®. The seven factors Congress directed the FAA to consider when
approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity
to airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight ­ each support

                                                          1
the request. In particular, the aircraft are small, and will operate at slow speeds, close to the ground,
far from airports and in a low risk, low population environment. In addition, the substantial
experience of the PIC weighs heavily in favor of granting the exemption.

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. 11.35, Owlcam requests confidential treatment for certain information
provided with this request for exemption. Specifically, Owlcam requests that information
contained in its user manual, Owlcam' s operating procedures, not be made public due to the
proprietary information that the application has not and will not share with others. Additionally,
Owlcam requests that personal information related to the PIC, including a copy of his pilot license,
not be made public in order to protect his identity. These documents are not available to the public
and are protected from release under the Freedom oflnformation Act 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq.

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.27;

91.417.

         Approval of exemptions for Owlcam LLC will allow commercial operations of
         sUASs in rural, remote, low density areas on the Hawai'ian Islands, for the purpose
         of real estate photography and videotaping. The pilot in command (PIC) is a
         certified commercial and instrument-rated helicopter pilot with more than 6,100
         hours of flight time, and has a second class medical certificate. The requested
         exemption should be granted because proposed operation of the DJI Phantom 2, a
         small UASs weighing 2.9 lbs., inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the
         strict conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety, as
         Congress intended, while still allowing commercial operations. The lightweight
         aircraft covered by the exemption are far safer than conventional operations
         conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft operating in close proximity to
         the ground and people. The seven factors Congress directed the FAA to consider
         when approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational
         capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within
         visual line of sight ­ each support the request. In particular, the aircraft are small,
         and will operate at slow speeds, close to the ground, far from airports and in a low
         risk, low population environment. In addition, the substantial experience of the PIC
         weighs heavily in favor of granting the exemption.

III. Owlcam LLC's Operations

A. The sUAS

         The requested exemption will permit the operation of the DJI Phantom 2. The Phantom 2
is a small, unmanned multirotor aircraft, weighing 2.9 lbs. inclusive of batteries, the propeller
guard, and technical payload. This rotorcraft can operate at a speed up to 29 knots, but Owlcam
LLC ("Owlcam) will limit the speed to no more than 20 knots. The FAA has previously granted
Exemption No. 11138, allowing commercial flight of a member of the DJI Phantom 2 family, the
Phantom 2 Vision+. Exemption No. 11138 is attached to this petition as Exhibit 10.

         The sUAS will have the following specifications:

Airframe: DJI Phantom 2
Flight Control System: Naza ­ M V2, which includes the main controller (MC), internal
measurement unit (IMU) with built-in internal sensor, barometric altimeter, which measures
attitude and altitude, compass, GPS, and radio receiver (Rx).
Transmitter (Tx): Futaba T14SG
Receiver (Rx): Internal to DJI Phantom 2
Data Link: 2.4G Data Link
Video Link: DJI AVL 58
Gimbal: H3-3D Zenmuse Gimbal for GoPro Hero
Camera: Go Pro Hero 4 Black
Batteries: 3S LiPo, 5200-mAh, 11.1V
iOSD: DJI iOSD mini, which allows live telemetry to be displayed on the video monitor, including
the battery level, and altitude.

         Please refer to Exhibits 1-8 for further information about the sUAS and transmitter.

B. Flight Conditions

         The sUAS will be flown in airspace under 400 feet above ground level ("AGL") and under
controlled conditions in rural areas. The majority of flights will take place under 100 feet AGL.
Owlcam's operations will occur in rural, remote areas on the Hawai'ian Islands. Owlcam will
avoid congested and densely populated areas and will work with local Flight Standard District
Offices to determine safe areas to fly in. Owlcam will only operate its sUAS in VMC, visual
meteorological conditions: no less than 500 feet below and no less than 2,000 feet horizontally
from a cloud or when visibility at least 3 statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always
make a safety assessment of the risk of every operation, and will only operate when it is determined
that no undue hazards are present.

C. Flight Operations

         Owlcam's flight operations require that the sUAS will always be in the line of sight of both
a PIC and a monitor specialist, who will also act as the visual observer (VO). Flights will be at
altitudes of no more than 400 feet AGL, and at speeds less than 20 knots. Despite the 400 ft. AGL
limit, most flights will take place at an altitude of no more than 100 ft. AGL.

                                                          6
         The PIC has a commercial rotorcraft license with an IFR rating, with 6,100 hours of flight
time, and a second class medical certificate. The VO has over four years of experience with RC
aircraft, and has over 100 hours flying sUAS as a hobbyist.

         The week of an operation, the flight crew will file a flight plan with the local FSDO and
contact ATC. The day before an operation, the flight crew will visit and inspect for safety the area
in which operations will take place. The flight crew will also contact any neighbors to notify them
of the filming. The sUAS will only fly over land which it has permission from the landowner or
landowner's agent to fly above. The notification will consist of, at minimum, the time, place, and
type of UAS operation being conducted. The flight crew will also have letters to leave in mailboxes
and front doors, informing neighbors of the planned sUAS operations. The flight crew will also
conduct a safety briefing with the property owners.

         Flights will take place on parcels of land that are at least approximately an area of half an
acre to a full acre. Operations will not take place in congested or densely populated areas, and the
PIC will work with the local FSDO when planning operations. The flight crew will obtain all
aeronautical and weather data information, as laid out in Section 6 of the Operations Manual.
Exhibit 1.

         On the day of filming, the flight crew will wear florescent shirts or vests to increase
visibility. Prior to departing for an operation, the flight crew will briefly turn on the sUAS to ensure
that everything is connected and that the sUAS is in operational condition.

         Upon arrival at a location for filming or photography, the flight crew will conduct an aerial
and ground preflight inspection. This inspection is listed in Appendix D to the Owlcam Operations
Manual.

         The flight crew will then set out traffic cones to designate the aircraft's "home area," which
will be a circle of approximately 20 feet in diameter to mark the sUAS take-off and landing zone.

         Note: If the radio control link is broken during flight, the autopilot system will recognize
this broken control link and cause the sUAS to automatically return to the home area as recorded
by the GPS instrumentation.

         The flight crew will conduct a physical inspection of the aircraft as set out in Appendix D
of the Operations Manual.

         The flight crew will then power on the sUAS and set up a laptop connected to the sUAS
with the DJI AVL 58 video link. This laptop will display the telemetry information during the
flight, and be monitored by the VO. The VO will be able to see the images taken by the GoPro
camera in real time.

         The PIC will then conduct a pre-flight inspection as outlined in Appendix D of the
Operations Manual.

         At any time during the flight, should the aircraft lose connection with the remote control,
the flight control system failsafe will be activated automatically, and the aircraft will to return to
the previously-set home area and land, in order to reduce injuries or damage. If any of the following

                                                          7
situations occur, the aircraft will not receive a signal, and enter into this failsafe mode:

              The remote control is powered off;
              The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote

                  control, which is no greater than 1,000 meters (3,280 feet);
              There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the

                  aircraft, essentially reducing the distance the signal can travel; or
              There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

         For further information regarding the DJI Phantom 2's failsafe functions, please refer to
Exhibit 1, the DJI User Manual, Section 6.4, beginning on page 25 of that document, and Exhibit
4, the Naza-M V2 flight control guide, section on Advanced Functions, beginning on page 16 of
that document.

         The DJI Phantom 2 also has "no fly zones" programmed into it, which will prevent flights
in restricted zones. Although Owlcam will take every precaution to avoid flying in airspace other
than class G airspace, the preprogrammed "no fly zones" will add an additional level of safety to
operations. For further information regarding the DJI's "no fly zones," please refer to Exhibit 1,
Section 6.7 of the DJI User Manual, beginning on page 28 of that document, and Exhibit 7.

         Other than this automated feature of the DJI Phantom 2, the PIC will always fly the sUAS
manually. The PIC and VO have tested the sUAS in a variety of weather conditions, including on
overcast days and in winds up to 15 knots. The PIC and VO will not fly the sUAS in heavy
rainstorms, due to decreased visibility and the potential for water damage to the sUAS. The PIC
and VO have also practiced emergency bailout procedures by having the sUAS return to home. In
the event of an emergency, the PIC will release the joysticks. This will make the sUAS
automatically hover in place and maintain its position and altitude, and the PIC and VO can
determine if and when it is safe for the sUAS to return to the home location.

         During flights, the PIC and the VO will be standing next to each other, in oral
communication at all times at the ground station. The VO will observe the telemetry data on the
laptop and will monitor the images from the camera from the laptop. The VO will direct the PIC
if she wishes to capture a different angle on the camera. The Go Pro Hero 4 Black camera will be
filming or taking still images at intervals during the entirety of the flight and is not controlled
independently from the ground station, other than by the movement of the sUAS.

         Flights will be limited to 18 minutes, which is 75% of the total battery life of the DJI
Phantom 2. Once the sUAS has landed, the PIC will conduct a post-flight checklist as set out in
Appendix D of the Operations Manual.

IV. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur over rural property with the property owner's prior knowledge and consent. The
only people and/or property to be filmed will have requested and hired Owlcam for the express
purpose of filming and photographing the people and/or property with the sUAS.

         No attempt will be made to identify any individuals filmed or photographed during the
                                                          8
flights who have not consented to be filmed or photographed, except in cases where they are
trespassing upon or damaging customer property, or interfering with the applicant's or its
customers' operations

V. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Owlcam proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at
least an equivalent or higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory structure.

         These limitations and conditions to which Owlcam agrees to be bound when conducting
commercial operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

  1. The sUAS will weigh significantly less than fifty (50) lbs. The DJI Phantom 2 weighs 2.9
      lbs., inclusive of battery and payload.

  2. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and VO.

  3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 75% of battery life. Flights will
      be terminated once the battery reaches a 25% level. This data will be available through
      telemetry data submitted to the transmitter and monitor.

  4. The sUAS will remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned operations and
      activities at all times.

  5. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL. Despite this limitation,
      the majority of flights are anticipated to operate at no more than 100 feet AGL.

  6. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS PIC and VO.

  7. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to each day's
      activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
      with the operations be present for this briefing.

  8. The operator will obtain a FAA UAS Civil COA prior to conducting any operations under
      this grant of exemption.

  9. The operator will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance,
      but not less than 48 hours prior to the operation.

  10. At least three days before scheduled filming, the operator of the sUAS will submit a written
      Plan of Activities to the local FSDO with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming.

  11. The PIC is a certified commercial and instrument-rated helicopter pilot with more than 5,500
      hours of flight time, and has a second class medical certificate. Copies of the certification
      and license are submitted under seal as Appendix A to Exhibit 1.

  12. The PIC and VO have practiced the DJI Phantom 2 for approximately 60 minutes a day,
                                                          9
      every day, for 90 days, translating to 90 hours of flight on this model. Practice flights have
      been in a variety of weather conditions, including in winds up to 15 knots and on overcast
      days. Practice flights have also included using the DJI Phantom 2's emergency return-to-
      home features.

  13. The PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate by voice and be stationed next to
      each other at the ground station.

  14. Written and/or oral permission from the landowner or authorized agent, of the land over
      which the sUAS will be flying.

  15. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or city
      jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
      agencies.

  16. The sUAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
      emergencies. The PIC and VO have practiced the emergency failsafe procedures, as
      described above on pages 6-7.

  17. If the multirotor and its controller disconnects during flight, the system's failsafe protection
      will come to the rescue and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather
      than flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location. For more information on
      the failsafe procedures, please refer to Exhibits 1-5. This condition is similar to one granted
      in Exemption No. 11138, attached to this petition as Exhibit 8.

  18. Because the PIC is a licensed commercial helicopter pilot, he has been subject to the security
      screening by the Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, the sUAS that will be
      used, a DJI Phantom 2, weighs no more than 2.9 lbs., inclusive of battery and payload.
      Approval of commercial flights as outlined in this petition present no national security issue.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012--size, weight,
speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation within visual
line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the grant of the
requested exemptions allowing commercial operation of applicant's sUAS pursuant to Owlcam's
rules of operation appended hereto.

VI. Public Interest and Safety

         Use of the sUAS will increase ground safety by eliminating the need to have a manned,
aircraft take the videos or photographs. As the FAA recognized in the Douglas Trudeau, Realtor®
Exemption, No. 11138:

         "Manned aircraft conducting aerial filming and photography can weigh 5,000 lbs. or more,
         are operated by an onboard pilot and may carry other onboard crewmembers, as well as
         100 gallons or more of fuel. The petitioner's [sUAS] weighs less than 3 lbs. The pilot and
         crew will be remotely located from the aircraft. The limited weight reduces the potential
         for harm to persons or damage to property in the event of an incident or accident. The risk
         of an onboard pilot and crew during an incident or accident is eliminated with the use of a

                                                         10
         [sUAS] for the proposed operation." Exhibit 10 at 11-12.

         As in the cited exemption, Owlcam will use a member of the DJI Phantom family, the DJI
Phantom 2. This sUAS also weighs 2.9 lbs., inclusive of battery and payload.

         During Owlcam's operations, the PIC and VO will similarly be safely on the ground,
directing the DJI Phantom 2 at altitudes no higher than 400 feet AGL. Owlcam will not fly over
congested or densely populated locations, and will work with local FSDO when planning
operations. Owlcam's flight crew will make a safety assessment prior to each operation, and will
only operate when there are no undue risks.

         The small weight, 2.9 lbs., is less than the size envisioned in Section 334(c)(2)(C) of the
FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which allows government agencies "to operate
unmanned aircraft weighing 4.4 pounds or less, if operated ­

    (i) within the line of sight of the operator;
    (ii) less than 400 feet above the ground;
    (iii) during daylight conditions;
    (iv) within Class G airspace; and
    (v) outside of 5 statute miles from any airport, heliport, seaplane base, spaceport, or other

             location with aviation activities."

         Congress's determination that government agencies should be allowed to operate such
aircraft in these situations, with no further restrictions on location, population density, or pilot
experience and training, indicates that Congress did not believe that aircraft of this size and weight
warranted additional attention.

         The PIC for Owlcam is a professional commercial helicopter pilot, who flies both an A-
Star helicopter and an EC-130 helicopter. The A-Star's maximum gross weight is 4,960 pounds,
and the EC-130's maximum gross weight is 5,350 pounds. As the FAA recognized in Exemption
No. 1162, manned aircraft of this size can pose a much greater threat to its occupants as well as to
individuals on the ground. Additionally, a much greater space will be necessary for takeoff,
landing, and operations than would be necessary for the 2.9 lbs. sUAS that Owlcam requests an
exemption to use and may render filming an area impossible, due to the rural areas Owlcam wishes
to operate in, and the low height footage Owlcam wishes to shoot.

VII. Regulations from Which Exemption is Requested

A. 14 C.F.R. 21(h): Airworthiness Certificates

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 21(h). This exemption meets the
requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 based on the small size, light
weight, relatively slow speed, and use in controlled environments on private land, as described
previously in this petition. In Exemption No. 11138, the FAA stated that the Secretary of
Transportation has determined that a member of the DJI Phantom 2 family, the Phantom 2 Vision+
meets the statutory conditions of Section 333, considering the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation. See Exhibit 10 at 11.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam's proposed exemption meets the requirements for an

                                                         11
equivalent level of safety of this section, pursuant to Section 333, based on the following factors:
              Small size: the DJI Phantom 2 has a diagonal length of 350 millimeters, 13.77
                  inches.
              Light weight: 2.9 lbs.
              Relatively slow speed: the PIC will limit the sUAS's speed to 20 knots (23 miles
                  per hour).
              Operational capacity: currently, the DJI Phantom 2 can operate for 25 minutes.
                  Flights will be terminated when 25% of the battery life remains. The DJI Phantom
                  2 can travel no more than 1,000 meters, 3280.84 feet, from the receiver.
              Proximity to airports: Owlcam will only operate in Class G airspace, and will notify
                  ATC and the local FSDO prior to operations, as described previously.
              Proximity to populated areas Owlcam will avoid the yellow congested areas in the
                  Hawai'i Sectional Aeronautical Charts, and work with the local Flight Standards
                  District Offices to determine which areas to avoid during flights. Local FSDO may
                  carve out areas indicated as yellow in the sectional chart and allow Owlcam to fly
                  in these specifically designated carve-out areas.
              Operation within visual line of sight: The PIC will always fly the sUAS within its
                  line of sight.
              Location: Owlcam will operate in rural, remote areas, with low population density,
                  on the Hawai'ian Islands to take photographs and video.
              Altitude: no more than 400 feet AGL, but the majority of flights are anticipated at
                  no more than 100 feet AGL.
              Restricted area in which the sUAS will be operated: as described above, prior to
                  the day of filming, the flight crew will visit with neighbors to inform them of the
                  filming over the consenting landowner's property. During filming, which will occur
                  in rural areas, the flight crew will set out cones to mark the "home area" for the
                  sUAS, and will monitor the area to make sure no one comes into the flight area.
                  Should any nonparticipating individual enter the flight area, operations will
                  immediately cease. See Exhibit 10 at 19.
              Substantial experience of the PIC: the PIC has a commercial rotorcraft license with
                  an IFR rating, with 6,100 hours of flight time in manned aircraft.

B. 14 C.F.R. 43.7: Persons authorized to approve aircraft, airframes, aircraft engines,
         propellers, appliances, or component parts for return to service after maintenance,
         preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 43.7. This part provides, inter alia, that the
holder of a mechanic certificate or a repair station certificate may approve an aircraft, airframe,
aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or component part for return to service. As described
previously, Owlcam's flight crew will be capable to repair and maintain the DJI Phantom 2 to meet
an equivalent level of safety of this section.

         Equivalent level of safety: The nature of the sUAS is that of a model aircraft, and the
operators of Owlcam who will maintain and when necessary repair the sUAS will conduct
inspections and maintenance based on maintenance guidelines provided by the manufacturer of
the sUAS, DJI. See Exhibits 1-5. The capabilities of these operators to maintain and repair the
sUAS will be listed in the operator's manual and meet the requirements for an equivalent level of

                                                         12
safety pursuant to Section 333 for the type of sUAS, its intended use, and the rural operating
environment.

C. 14 C.F.R. 43.11: Content, form, and disposition of records for inspections conducted
         under parts 91 and 125 and §§135.411(a)(1) and 135.419 of this chapter.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 43.11. This part provides, inter alia, that
maintenance record entries be maintained and for the listing of discrepancies and placards by
inspectors. The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room for placards to be placed in or on
it and no inspections for sUAS have been certified by FAA at the present time.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will keep log books of all maintenance and repairs at
the ground station, as envisioned in the FAA Memorandum subject, "Interpretation regarding
whether certain required documents may be kept at an unmanned aircraft's control station," dated
August 8, 2014. See Exhibit 8. This request provides an equivalent level of safety as 14 C.F.R.
43.11 because the documentation will be at the ground station with the PIC, where it will be
useable in case of an emergency, rather than with the sUAS which could be up to 1,000 meters
from the operator.

D. 14 C.F.R. 45.11: Marking of products.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.11. This part provides, inter alia, that
the manufacturers of aircraft, engines, propellers, mark such aircraft, engines, or propellers with
an approved fireproof identification plate. The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room for
fireproof placards to be placed in it. Any required placards could become hazardous, due to the
additional weight and strain placed on the sUAS. Any additional weight or placards on the 2.9 lbs.
sUAS could create a risk, due to the very small size and nature of the DJI Phantom 2.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam's PIC and VO will keep information related to the
DJI Phantom 2, including the user manual, at the ground control station and affix its N-Number,
once obtained from the FAA Registration Office, on the "arms" of the sUAS as large as practicably
possible. This exemption provides an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 45.11 because the
relevant documentation containing the serial number will be at the ground station with the PIC,
where it will be useable in case of an emergency, rather than with the sUAS. In addition, the
fuselage is marked with "DJI," the manufacturer of the sUAS.

E. 14 C.F.R. 45.27: Location of marks; nonfixed-wing aircraft

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.27. This part provides, inter alia, that
each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that rotorcraft horizontally on both surfaces of the
cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail the marks required by §45.23. The sUAS, due to its small size, does
not have a cabin, fuselage, boom or tail to display the marks required by §45.23.

         Equivalent level of safety: Once Owlcam receives its N-Number, it will display these
marks on the "arms" of the aircraft as large as practicably possible. This exemption provides an
equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 45.27 because the sUAS will be registered with the FAA
Aircraft Registration Branch. In the event of incident, the sUAS will be traceable to Owlcam.

                                                         13
F. 14 C.F.R. 45.29: Size of marks

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.27. This part provides, inter alia, at
subpart (3) that the registration marks for rotorcraft must be at least 12 inches high. The sUAS,
due to its small size, does not have any surface area large enough to display marks anywhere near
12 inches high.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will affix its registration number as large as
practicably possible on its "arms" once it obtains the N-Number. This exemption provides an
equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 45.29 because the sUAS will be registered with the FAA
Aircraft Registration Branch. In the event of incident, the sUAS will be traceable to Owlcam.

G. 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

         The FAA has previously stated that no exemption is required for a member of the DJI
Phantom 2 family. Exhibit 8 at 17. Owlcam requests the same determination to be made for its DJI
Phantom 2.

         Alternatively, Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a). The regulation
requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition. As there will
be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft should this exemption be granted, no standard
will exist for determining airworthiness.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will keep the DJI Phantom 2's maintenance and safety
information at the ground station, where it will be readily accessible to the PIC and VO before,
during, and after operations. This exemption provides an equivalent level of safety as 14 C.F.R.
91.7(a) because the PIC will be able to make the determination of whether the sUAS is in an
airworthy mechanical and electrical condition, in accordance with 14 C.F.R. 91.7(b).

H. 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard
         requirements.

         The FAA has previously stated that no exemption is required for a member of the DJI
Phantom 2 family. Exhibit 10 at 17. Owlcam requests the same determination to be made for its
DJI Phantom 2.

         Alternatively, Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2). This part
provides:

         "(b) No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft...

         (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
         this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved Airplane or
         Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
         any combination thereof."

         First, there does not currently exist a method of approving manuals for sUAS. Second,
given the size and configuration of the sUAS, there is no space to carry such a flight manual on

                                                         14
the aircraft. In addition, carrying the manual on the aircraft would be pointless, since there is no
pilot or other person on board who could read or use it. On August 8, 2014, the FAA issued a
memorandum entitled "Interpretation regarding whether certain required documents may be kept
at an unmanned aircraft's control station." This document stated, in part "maintaining these
documents at the pilot's control station would meet the intent of the rule as the pilot would be able
to produce the documents for his or her own information or to an FAA inspector." See Exhibit 9.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will keep its flight manual at the ground station, where
both the PIC and VO can access it. An equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2) is provided
because the intent of this rule ­ the pilot having access to this material during flight ­ is met.

I. 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c). This part provides: "(c) No person
may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft unless that aircraft is identified in accordance with part
45 of this chapter."

         As stated above, Owlcam will obtain an N-Number from the FAA Registration Office and
the sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room to contain fireproof placard or to display
aircraft marks in a conventional size. However, once Owlcam obtains an N-Number, it will place
the number on the "arms" of the aircraft as large as practicably possible.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will obtain its N-Number from the FAA Registration
Office and affix it to the "arms" of the aircraft as large as practicably possible. An equivalent level
of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c) is met because the sUAS will be registered with the FAA and
identifiable in the event of an incident.

J. 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2): Preflight action.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2) to the extent that is applicable.
This part provides:

         "Each pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all
         available information concerning that flight. This information must include--... (b)
         For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following takeoff
         and landing distance information: ... (2) For civil aircraft other than those specified
         in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, other reliable information appropriate to the
         aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under expected values of airport elevation
         and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and temperature."

         Owlcam's PIC in fact will, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all available
information concerning that flight, including the aircraft performance under expected elevations,
the gross weight of the aircraft (which will be no more than 2.9 lbs.), and the wind and temperature.
As the flights of the sUAS will not be at airports the information required of Part 91.103(b)(2)
does not apply.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam shall perform preflight operations as outlined
previously in this petition, and flights will not be at airports. An equivalent level of safety to 14

                                                         15
C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2) will be met because the PIC will become familiar with the conditions prior to
the flight, including the aircraft performance under expected elevations, the gross weight of the
aircraft (which will be no more than 2.9 lbs), and the wind and temperature.

K. 14 C.F.R. 91.105: Flight crewmembers at stations.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.105 since this part is not applicable due
to the sUAS carrying no flight crewmembers.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will not operate the aircraft unless someone is at the
controls at all times, and each flight will be manually flown, with the exception of the DJI Phantom
2's automated safety features. This will provide an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.105
because the flight crew will be at their stations at all times during the flight. The stations will not
be on the aircraft but on the ground.

L. 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b): Right-of-way rules: Except water operations.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 113(b) to the extent that it applies to
overhead aircraft operating at or above 500 feet AGL as the sUAS will be operating no higher than
400 feet AGL. This part provides:

         "(b): General. When weather conditions permit, regardless of whether an operation
         is conducted under instrument flight rules or visual flight rules, vigilance shall be
         maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft.
         When a rule of this section gives another aircraft the right-of-way, the pilot shall
         give way to that aircraft and may not pass over, under, or ahead of it unless well
         clear."

         For example, if another aircraft is operating overhead at 10,000 feet AGL there is no danger
posed to that other aircraft if the sUAS is operating under it or ahead of it at or beneath 400 feet
AGL. Despite this, should another aircraft enter the area in which Owlcam is operation, because
the flight will be within his line of sight, the PIC will be able to give right of way to that aircraft.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will operate its sUAS to see and avoid and give way
to other aircraft that should enter airspace at or below 400 feet AGL, and will give right-of-way to
manned aircraft. All flights will be in class G airspace and the majority of flights will be at no
more than 100 feet AGL, which will create a very slim chance that Owlcam's operations will
interfere with a manned aircraft's flight. This will provide an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R.
91.113(b) because the sUAS has significantly greater mobility than a much larger, manned aircraft.
As a result, the PIC will be able to react and respond much more quickly than the other pilot.

M. 14 C.F.R. 91.119(c): Minimum safe altitudes: General.

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.119 subpart (c). This regulation
provides:

         "Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft
         below the following altitudes...

                                                         16
         (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface,
         except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may
         not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure."

         Owlcam will not operate the sUAS any higher than 400 feet AGL.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will operate the sUAS no higher than 400 feet AGL,
and it is anticipated that the majority of operations will be no higher than 100 feet AGL. Owlcam
will not operate in congested areas, and will work with the local FSDO when planning operations.
Owlcam's flight crew will make a safety assessment prior to each operation, and only operate after
it determines that there is no undue hazard present. Exhibit 8 at 19.

         The 400 feet AGL maximum will provide an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R.
91.119(c) because, since 1981 with AC 91-57, this height has been an operating standard for model
aircraft. Additionally, in Section 334(c)(2)(C), Congress determined that sUAS operated by public
agencies flying sUAS the size of and larger than Owlcam's DJI Phantom 2 could fly up to 400 feet
AGL.

N. 14 C.F.R. 91.121: Altimeter Settings

         Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.121. This Part provides guidelines for
altimeter use in maintaining the cruising altitude or flight level of the aircraft. Owlcam is not
requesting a general exemption from the requirement that its sUAS have an Altimeter. The DJI
Phantom 2's flight controller will have an internal measurement unit ("IMU"). The IMU has a
built-in internal sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both attitude and altitude. See
Exhibit 1, Appendix B, page 5. Rather, Owlcam requests an exemption from the requirement to
set its altimeter to a station along the route, of out of an airport, because the DJI Phantom 2 is not
traveling point-to-point and is limited in the distance it can travel from the PIC. Additionally,
Owlcam will not be flying into or out of an airport.

         Equivalent level of safety: The requested exemption provides an equivalent level of safety
to 14 C.F.R 91.121 because Owlcam will not operate the sUAS above 400 feet AGL in a sustained
cruising flight mode such as a manned aircraft will typically fly. The PIC will at all times be
controlling the maximum height of the sUAS through the telemetry features of the DJI controller.
Additionally, the sUAS will be operated within the line of sight of the PIC. The FAA has
previously granted this exemption for similar proposed operations. See Exhibit 10.

O. 14 C.F.R. 91.151: Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.

         The sUAS Owlcam will fly is powered by electricity, using lithium polymer batteries that
currently have a flight limit of approximately no more than 25 minutes. (See Exhibits 1 and 10).
Therefore, due to the limitations of the batteries, it is currently impossible to comply with Part
91.151. However, the sUAS will be operated in a manner with at least the equivalent level of safety
as that of a manned aircraft complying with Part 91.151.

         Operation of an sUAS with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel does not engender the type
of risks that Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate. During the entire flight, the PIC will
always have a visual line of sight of the sUAS and the VO will be monitoring the battery life via

                                                         17
the telemetry display on the laptop at the ground station. The sUAS will always have enough power
to land safely, given the minimum level of reserve capacity of the batteries.

         Owlcam will limit flights to 75% of battery capacity. With the battery Owlcam currently
uses, the 75% point occurs at 18 minutes, leaving 7 minutes for the sUAS to reach the planned
landing zone. This amount of time will be more than sufficient for the PIC to safely return to and
land in the "home area." As battery power increases, the number of minutes the sUAS can operate
before reaching the 75% mark will also increase. As new batteries are obtained and put into use,
Owlcam will continue to terminate flights after 75% of battery power has been used.

         Applicant believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) is consistent with the scope
of similar exemptions already granted to other operations. Exhibit 10.

         Equivalent level of safety: Owlcam will limit flights 75% of battery power. The proposed
exemption meets an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.151 because, given the limitations
on Owlcam's proposed operations and the location of those operations, a reduced minimum power
reserve for flight in daylight VFR conditions is reasonable.

P. 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b): Civil aircraft: Certifications required.

         The FAA has previously determined that exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b) is
not necessary. See Exhibit 10 at 17.

         Alternatively, Owlcam requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b). This
section provides in part:

         "(a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it
         has within it the following:

         (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

         (2) An effective U.S. registration certificate issued to its owner...

         (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate
         required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued
         under § 91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to
         passengers or crew."

         First, there are currently no procedures in effect for providing airworthiness certificates for
sUAS. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Owlcam will display its N-Number,
once received, on the sUAS, and the operator will have, at the ground station, the user manual for
the DJI Phantom 2.

         Second, the sUAS Owlcam will use the DJI Phantom 2, which has an equivalent level of
safety as a manned aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. Please refer to Exhibit 10, Exemption
No. 11138, as Owlcam's DJI Phantom 2 is in the same sUAS family as the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+,
which was the subject of that exemption. This sUAS provides a number of safety features,
including the automatic return to home failsafe discussed in detail above.

                                                         18
         Because of the use of GPS with the sUAS, the operator will set the initial location of flight
takeoff ("home position") and if the radio control link is broken, the autopilot system will recognize
this broken control link and cause the sUAS to automatically return to the home position as
recorded by the GPS instrumentation. Exhibits 1-7. Additionally, because the sUAS team will
mark off an area with traffic cones that has a 20 ft. radius, approximately 30 ft. from the operators
that will be used as the "home position" for the sUAS to return, no one will be standing in the way
of the path.

         These safety enhancements provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property
owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under
Subpart H. Application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat to
national security posed by the UAS, due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack
of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial payload.

         In the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed, operation of the sUAS
will be at least as safe as a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an
airworthiness certificate but without the restrictions and conditions proposed. Owlcam will not
accept assignments from clients that would take place in Class B, C, D, or E airspace. Owlcam
will avoid flying over congested and populated areas and will work with local FSDO to avoid these
areas when planning operations.

         Equivalent level of safety: The sUAS to be operated hereunder is 2.9 lbs. inclusive of
batteries and technical payload, carries neither a pilot nor passengers, and carries no explosive
materials or flammable liquid fuels. The sUASs operating under this exemption will be tightly
controlled and monitored by the operator and the observer, and in compliance with local public
safety requirements, to provide security for the area of operation. The FAA will have advance
notice of all operations because Owlcam will notify both ATC and the local FSDO prior to
operations, as described previously in this petition. Granting the proposed exemption will achieve
an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b) because of the small size of the sUAS
and the operational limits set out above.

Q. 14 C.F.R. 91.215: ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use

         This section requires that installed Air Traffic Control (ATC) transponder equipment must
meet specific performance and environmental requirements, and aircraft must be equipped with an
operable coded radar beacon transponder.

         There are presently no known commercially available ATC transponders that meet the
payload requirements of a sUAS and are available at reasonable cost. However, because the sUASs
used by Owlcam will not be flying into or near airports, and will fly no higher than 400 feet AGL,
there is very low risk of collision with any manned aircraft. In addition, because there will be no
need to have contemporaneous communication with ATC Control, due to the short distances, short
flight times, and restricted altitude the sUASs will operate within, Owlcam requests an exemption
from this section. Additionally, the sUAS is too small to contain ATC transponder equipment in
any form factor that is known to be available commercially.

         Equivalent level of safety: An equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.215 will be met
because Owlcam will not fly its sUAS into or near airports, and all operations will be below 400

                                                         19
feet AGL, so there is very low risk of collision with any manned aircraft. Owlcam will contact
local ATC before operations to issue a NOTAM, and the local FSDO with its flight plan, as
described previously in this petition. Owlcam also give right of way to any manned aircraft that
do appear.

R. 14 C.F.R. 91.403: General

         This section requires that the owner or operator of an aircraft is primarily responsible for
maintaining that aircraft in an airworthy condition. Owlcam will adhere to this requirement.
However, this Section also limits maintenance to that "prescribed in this subpart and other
applicable regulations, including part 43 of this chapter." Because of this limitation, and because
of the exemptions under Part 43 requested above, Owlcam requests an exemption from this
Section.

         This exemption meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section
333 based on the small size, light weight, relatively slow speed, and use in controlled rural
environments on private, secured land, as described previously in this petition.

         Equivalent level of safety: To achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.403,
Owlcam will maintain its sUAS in an airworthy condition and adhere to all manufacturer
requirements for inspecting and maintaining the DJI Phantom 2. Owlcam will keep records of
maintenance to the sUAS, and these records will be available to the PIC and VO before, during,
and after operations of the sUAS.

S. 14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a) and (d): Maintenance Required

         This section requires that aircraft be inspected as prescribed by Section E, 14 C.F.R.
§§91.401-91.421. As shown below, Owlcam is applying for an exemption for these sections, due
to the fact that its operators will inspect the sUAS prior to each flight and keep maintenance records
of all parts that are replaced, in accordance with DJI's instructions. Because the Sections discussed
below are concerned with manned aircraft, and as such have inspection requirements designed for
the safety of passengers, they are inapplicable to Owlcam.

         Owlcam is also applying for an exemption to subpart (d) of this section, which requires a
placard to be installed and references §43.11. As noted previously, Owlcam requests an exemption
to the placard requirement, because, due to the small size of the sUAS, there is no room to place
the placard.

         Despite the requested exemption from subparts (a) and (d) of this section, Owlcam will
follow subparts (b) and (c) of this subpart.

         Equivalent level of safety: To achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a)
and (b), Owlcam will keep logbooks detailing all maintenance and repairs to the sUAS. The
logbooks will be available to the PIC and VO before, during, and after sUAS operation. Prior to
conducting post-maintenance operations, the flight crew will conduct a test flight to ensure that
the sUAS functions properly. The FAA has previously determined that following the
manufacturer's requirements for maintenance, inspection, and record keeping are sufficient to
ensure that safety is not adversely affected. Exhibit 10 at 13.

                                                         20
T. 14 C.F.R. 91.407: Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,
         or alteration

         This section requires that any aircraft which "has undergone maintenance, preventative
maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration unless . . . [i]t has been approved for return to service by a
person authorized under § 43.7 of this chapter . . .."

         However, Owlcam has requested an exemption from §§ 43.7 and 43.11 as described
previously. The capability of the operators to maintain and repair the sUAS meets the requirements
for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 for both the type of sUAS, its intended
use, and the rural operating environment. Additionally, due to the small size of the sUAS, there is
no room to place inspection placards.

         Therefore, because Owlcam has requested an exemption from 43.7 and 43.11, Owlcam
respectfully requests an exemption from 91.407. The PIC, who holds a commercial pilot's
certificate, will conduct maintenance on the sUAS and keep logs of the battery cycle and repairs
needed on the body or the propellers of the DJI Phantom 2.

         Equivalent level of safety: The proposed exemption will meet an equivalent level of safety
to 14 C.F.R. 91.407 because Owlcam will regularly inspect and maintain its sUASs in accordance
with the DJI operator manual, and keep detailed inspection and maintenance records that will be
available to the PIC and VO before, during, and after operations. Prior to conducting post-
maintenance operations, Owlcam will conduct a test flight to ensure that the sUAS functions
properly.

U. 14 C.F.R. 91.409: Inspections

         This section lays out specific requirements for inspections of aircraft. Owlcam respectfully
requests an exemption from these requirements because they are intended to maintain the safety
of manned aircraft significantly larger and capable of significantly longer flights than is sUAS.
Owlcam's pre-flight and post-flight inspections meet or exceed the level of safety achieved by
adherence to 14 C.F.R. 91.409.

         Equivalent level of safety: As discussed above and in Appendix D, Owlcam has an
inspection procedure that provides an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.409. Before and
after each flight, the flight crew will conduct an inspection of the sUAS as described previously.

V. 14 C.F.R. 91.417: Maintenance records

         Owlcam respectfully requests an exemption from this Section, as it is only applicable for
aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. Because Owlcam will not have an airworthiness
certificate, this Section is inapplicable.

         Equivalent level of safety: The requested exemption will meet an equivalent level of
safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.417 because Owlcam will keep detailed maintenance records on every part
as it is replaced, including but not limited to propellers, batteries, and electrical components. The
detailed maintenance records will be accessible to the PIC and the VO before, during, and after
operations.
