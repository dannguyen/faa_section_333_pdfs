                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015­0347

Dear Mr. O'Neal:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letters dated June 3, 2015, and July 2, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of National UAS Solutions, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or
operator) for an amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and
(c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add the DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire, the DJI
S1000, and the Mozi Robotics Quadthrust 350.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11570
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11570 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    Vision+, DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire the DJI S1000, and the Mozi Robotics
    Quadthrust 350 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

         Re: Request to amend Exemption No. 11570 to allow National UAS Solutions, LLC
         to add the DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire and the DJI S1000 sUAS platforms under
         the same direction and limitations as provided within Exemption No. 11570, docket
         #FAA- 2015-0347, approved on May 13, 2015.

Dear Sir or Madam,

National UAS Solutions, LLC was issued an exemption under Section 333 of the "FAA
Modernization and Reform Act of 2012" numbered 11570 for the purpose of gathering aerial
data using the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ sUAS. Since the exemption was granted, National UAS
Solutions, LLC has determined the need to add the DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire and the DJI
S1000 quadcopter in order to remain competitive and enhance services afforded our customers.

The airworthiness of the DJI S1000 was previously determined by the FAA in Exemption No.
11156 (Total Safety U.S. Inc.), Exemption No 11158 (Team 5, LLC), and Exemption No. 11184
(Low Country RC). The airworthiness of the DJI Inspire was previously determined by the FAA
in exemption #11301 (Gulf Coast Unmanned Aerial Services, LLC). Since the Phantom 3 is
essentially the Phantom 2 Vision+ upgraded with a more professional camera system, it is
National UAS Solutions, LLC's belief that they are materially alike.

The DJI Phantom 3, Inspire and S1000 will all have a gross weight under 55 pounds, forward
speeds of less than 50 knots and an altitude restriction of under 400 feet. These sUAS's will be
operated in accordance with the limitations and restrictions enumerated in Exemption No. 11570
already granted National UAS Solutions, LLC.
Because the requested amendment would not set any precedent or otherwise raise any novel
issue, and because the addition of these sUAS platforms to our fleet will not materially affect our
already granted petition No. 11570 in any way, and because National UAS Solutions, LLC seeks
to begin these operations without delay, National UAS Solutions, LLC respectfully requests the
FAA to determine that good cause exists to dispense with publication of the summary of this
petition in the Federal Register and grant the requested amendment expeditiously by summary
means.

Thank you for your kind consideration in the granting of this amendment.

         Re: Request to amend Exemption No. 11570 to allow National UAS Solutions, LLC
         to add the MOZI ROBOTICS QUADTHRUST 350 sUAS platform under the same
         direction and limitations as provided within Exemption No. 11570, docket #FAA-
         2015-0347, approved on May 13, 2015.

Dear Sir or Madam,

National UAS Solutions, LLC was issued an exemption under Section 333 of the "FAA
Modernization and Reform Act of 2012" numbered 11570 for the purpose of gathering aerial
data using the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ sUAS. Since the exemption was granted, National UAS
Solutions, LLC has determined the need to add the MOZI ROBOTICS QUADTHRUST 350
quadcopter to the exemption in order to remain competitive and enhance services afforded our
customers.

The airworthiness of the MOZI ROBOTICS QUADTHRUST 350 is materially similar and a
direct replacement of the already approved DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

The MOZI ROBOTICS QUADTHRUST 350 has a gross weight under 55 pounds, forward
speeds of less than 50 knots and an altitude restriction of under 400 feet. This sUAS will be
operated in accordance with the limitations and restrictions enumerated in Exemption No. 11570
already granted National UAS Solutions, LLC.
Because the requested amendment would not set any precedent or otherwise raise any novel
issue, and because the addition of this sUAS platform to our fleet will not materially affect our
already granted petition No. 11570 in any way, and because National UAS Solutions, LLC seeks
to begin these operations without delay, National UAS Solutions, LLC respectfully requests the
FAA to determine that good cause exists to dispense with publication of the summary of this
petition in the Federal Register and grant the requested amendment expeditiously by summary
means.

Thank you for your kind consideration in the granting of this amendment.
