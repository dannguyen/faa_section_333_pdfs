Dear Messrs. Owen and Pierce:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 27, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of enrGies, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your current
exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to add the Sensefly eBee, Aeryon Labs Skyranger, Aeryon Labs Scout, AIBOTIX X6,
Tactical Robotics InstantEye, DJI Phantom3, DJI S800, DJI S900, and DJI S1000.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
                                                                                                                  2

unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11147A
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11147A remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Lockheed Martin
         Indago, the Lockheed Martin Desert Hawk III, DJI Phantom Vision +, Precision
         Lancaster MK3, Aeromao Talon, Aeromao Aeromapper 300, Aeromao Aeromapper
         EV-2, DJI Inspire, Sensefly eBee, Aeryon Labs Skyranger, Aeryon Labs Scout,
         AIBOTIX X6, Tactical Robotics InstantEye, DJI Phantom3, DJI S800, DJI S900, and
         DJI S1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.
                                                                                     3

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Dear Sir or Madam;

enrGies Inc. currently holds Exemptions ntunbered 11147 and 11147A (hereinafter the Exemption) issued for the
purpose of performing Aerial Data Collection. enrGies Inc. herby requests an amendment to that Exemption to
include additional small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) that fully complies with the conditions of the
Exemption to support client requests (public interest).

The requested systems (under the same terms and conditions contained in the original Exemption) are cited below.
      1. Parrot, sense Fly -- eBee;
      2. Aeryon Labs -- SkyRanger and Scout;
      3. AIBOTIX -- X6;
      4. Physical Sciences Inc., Tactical Robotics -- InstantEye;
      5. DJI--Phantom3, S800, S900 and S1000

All of the requested sUAS have been previously approved tluough the 333 exemption process for other
organizations and manuals are on file. enrGies Flight Operations and Procedures Manual (FOPM) and other
technical documentation was provided in our initial request. enrGies states that no conditions or limitations from
our original request have changed and all operations of the additional UAS will be in full compliance with the terms
of the Exemption.

As this is an amendment to our existing exemption, enrGies Inc. respectfally submits that good cause exists so that
notice does not need to be published in the Federal Register for the requested amendment.
