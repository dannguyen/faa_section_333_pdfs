                                                           Exemption No. 12659
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1780

Mr. Stephen Burtt
Aerial Technology International, LLC
9053 SE Jannsen Road
Clackamas, OR 97015

Dear Mr. Burtt:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 4, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Aerial Technology International, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial film and videography, photography, agricultural mapping, surveying, and
infrastructure inspections.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the ATI AgBot, Thor X4, and the AgGasser.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Aerial Technology International, LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Aerial Technology International, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the ATI AgBot,
    Thor X4, and AgGasser when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
    Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
    amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
                                                                                                            4

    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

RE: Aerial Technology International LLC sUAS Airworthiness Exemption Petition for
FMRA 2012 Sec 333 Exemption

Gentlemen:
Aerial Technology International, LLC (`ATI') hereby petitions the FAA for regulatory relief pur-
suant to Section 333 of P.L. 112­95 333 and 14 C.F.R. Sec. 11.81 to conduct commercial flights
with ATI sUAS and to pursue research and development of ATI sUAS. Attached, therefore, is a
request for exemption from airworthiness and specific Title 14 C.F.R. provisions for the types of
sUAS and sUAS operations described in this Section 333 exemption petition. Specifically, we re-
quest the airworthiness exemptions for ATI sUAS for the purposes of commercial film and video,
photography, agricultural mapping, and surveying, and infrastructure inspections. The FAA has
issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in
this petition, specifically Exemptions No. 11136, 11193, 11170, 11194, 11192, 11177, and 11166
(precision agriculture); No. 11066, 11150, 11062, 11080, 11160, 11067, 11178 (film&videography);
No. 11171, 11185, 11184, 11156, 11110, 11112 (mapping and inspections). We therefore request
that our petition be granted without delay.

Background
This petition seeks authorization to operate the ATI sUAS described in this petition within restricted-
access areas. These areas of operations include rural, agricultural areas similar to areas described
in Exemption No. 11136, 11193, 11170, 11194, 11192, 11177, and 11166. Restricted access areas
would also include areas restricted for film, photography, infrastructure inspection, and real estate
videography purposes. Our operations will generally fall within conditions of the blanket COA
provided with the 333 grant. For any other operation, a civil COA will be sought.

Generally, ATI sUAS operations will be below an altitude of 200 ft. AGL, within specific access-
restricted areas, either within Class G airspace or with the permission of the ATC, using sUAVs
operated by ATI-qualified sUAS pilots, and within the visual line of sight of the operator and
                                                                                                                                            2

observer. These operational limitations are in accordance with both recently granted petitions as
well as the Small UAS NPRM release February 15th, 2015. The UAVs described in this proposal
are of small size and weight (less than 55 lb.), only capable of relatively slow speeds (top speed of a
UAV to be deployed under this petition is less than 100 mph.) and, as demonstrated in this petition
and accompanying General Operating Manual (provided confidentially under separate cover), do
not pose a threat to the safety of the NAS, persons on the ground, or national security.
This petition seeks authorization to conduct commercial services, commercial training, and R&D
flights according to the terms of this petition and the ATI General Operations Manual (`ATI Man-
ual') which is composed of (1) an operations manual, (2) flight manuals for each of the ATI models;
(3) an Operator Training Manual, and (4) a Maintenance and Inspection Manual. Please note that
the ATI Manual (including all of the above listed components) are clearly marked "Confidential" on
each page and contain confidential commercial and proprietary information that ATI has not and
will not share with others who are not subject to a "Nondisclosure Agreement" (NDA). Therefore,
the ATI Manual (including all components) are not available to the public and contain operating
conditions, procedures and other information that are protected from public release or disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act 5 USC Sec. 552 et seq.

Why we require an exemption
ATI requires exemption from 14 CFR airworthiness and other requirements for both commericial op-
erations and development of new UAS for the several types of operations including; R&D, training,
precision agriculture services, infrastructure inspection, and various filming and surveying services.

Commercial Operations
All commerical SUAS operations require an exemption under current FAA regulations. ATI there-
fore requests an airworthiness exemption for the specific types of sUAS described in this petition in
order to carry sensor packages, e.g. film and video equipment under the conditions and operating
limitations outlined below and described in the ATI Manual. ATI intends to operate these sUAS to
provide services to farms in the United States in order to increase crop yields, and reduce water use,
and enhance agricultural efficiency. It is imperative for the economic well-being of US farmers that
the low-risk application of efficiency-enhancing and cost-reducing UAS technology in US agriculture
be permitted, especially during drought conditions such as are being faced in many areas today.
In addition, ATI intends to provide infrastructure inspection services including; bridge, powerline,
power pole, and wind turbine inspection, as well as commercial film and real estate videography
services.

Precision Agriculture
ATI unmanned systems simplify and increase the accuracy of data collection in precision agriculture,
infrastructure inspection, and aerial filming. ATI Ag Drones provide useful data that enable farmers,
viners and ranchers the ability to make cost-effective, proactive, decisions based on information
provided through video, infrared, multispectral and hypersprectral imaging. The data collected
from our Ag Drones can be used to identify insect problems and water issues, assess crop yields,
determine correct harvest times, track cattle, inspect fence lines, etc. that aid farmers to protect
and manage their investments. ATI also intends to use our Ag Drones to provide turn key services
to improve agriculture nationwide.
                                                                                                                                            3

Training and Education
An integral part of the intended ATI service offering is ensuring that purchasers of UAVs built
by ATI are fully qualified on the aircraft. ATI will provide mandatory operational training on all
professional aircraft sold to customers. This improves safety and security as well as reducing the
likelihood of unsatisfied customers. However, in order to perform this commercial flight training we
require an exemption.

Research and Development
ATI also designs and manufactures UAS and therefore needs to be able to rapidly iterate upon and
test our innovative designs. Unlike manned aircraft testing, which generally only requires airspace
away from air traffic above low-risk areas and which is mainly indifferent to the underlying terrain;
testing our sUAS requires access to real areas of operation, i.e. farms, power lines, etc. in order to
evaluate the low-altitude, context-dependent performance of both our aircraft and our sensors. For
example, multiple, real-world farms growing multiple varieties of crops are a requirement for the
functional testing of our aircraft.
Unfortunately, FAA Order 8130.34C for a Special Airworthiness Certificate: Experimental Category
does not authorize the necessary variations in aircraft characteristics, systems, or test ranges to
meaningfully test these sUAS and to iterate efficiently.
Therefore, to gain the meaningful data about sUAS features necessary for developing a program
for safe and efficient sUAS operations, an exemption is required that authorizes R & D: 1) across
a range of ATI models and prototypes, 2) in a variety of locations (subject to the restrictions
outlined in this petition), and 3) for iterating on the systems, sensors, and airframes on an ongoing
basis. Without this exemption the regulatory requirements for a Special Airworthiness Certificate,
Experimental Category (SAC-EC) are overly burdensome because they forbid the necessary R &
D; i.e. rapid iterations on early prototypes. Finally, as the FAA is well aware, the SAC-EC does
not authorize commercial operations of the type described above such are required for ATI research
and development.

The types of sUAS for which ATI requests exemptions
ATI designs and manufacturers sUAS that are low kinetic energy; these sUAS are approximately
equivalent in size and performance to the US Air Force "Micro UAS" class of UAS. Specifically, these
sUAS are small ( < 2 meter in largest dimension), light-weight ( 55 lb. or less ), slow-moving (less
than 100 mph) and operate close to the ground (< 500 ft. AGL).
We believe that ATI sUAS meet the standard provided by Section 333 of the FMRA for a UAS to
operate safely within the National Airspace prior to the completion of FMRA's required rule-making.
Section 333 describes seven minimum criteria to determine whether an sUAS may operate safely in
the NAS without creating a hazard or posing a threat to national security. These criteria comprise
size, weight, speed, operational capability, operation in close proximity to airports, operation in
close proximity to people, and operation within visual line of sight. ATI's sUAS are of a type and
scale that meet these criteria and are equivalent to those for which FAA has recently granted Sec
333 exemptions (see Ex. No. 11136, 11193, 11170, 11194, 11192, 11177, 11166) and, similarly, are
not anticipated to create a hazard to users of the National Airspace System ("NAS"), persons on the
ground, or pose a threat to national security. Basic characteristics of the ATI UAVs are summarized
in the table ATI SUAS (Table 1).

(c) The extent of relief ATI seeks, and the reason ATI seeks the relief
An exemption is required because current FAA regulations do not allow commercial use of sUAS
in the NAS, or for appropriate research and development of sUAS. ATI requests an airworthiness
exemption for the specific types of sUAS described in this petition to carry sensor packages under the
conditions and operating limitations outlined below and described in the ATI Manual. In addition,
                                                                                                                                            5

ATI is developing sUAS and sUAS software, so that sUAVs may fly safely and predictably in the
NAS. In order to develop and test these sUAS under the variety of operational conditions that a
sUAS will face in the NAS, it is necessary to test variations on aircraft characteristics and operating
systems in different, and real-world test environments. FAA regulations in FAA Order 8130.34C for
a Special Airworthiness Certificate: Experimental Category do not authorize the necessary rapid
modifications of aircraft characteristics and associated systems to sufficiently and efficiently test
these sUAS.
Therefore, to gain meaningful data about the necessary features for safe and efficient sUAS oper-
ations, an exemption is necessary : 1) to operate a range of sUAS models and prototypes, 2) in
a variety of locations (subject to the restrictions outlined in this petition), 3) to be permitted to
adjust the systems and airframes tested on an ongoing basis, and 4) for both research and commer-
cial use. Finally, as the FAA is well aware, the exemption is necessary because the SAC-EC does
not authorize commercial operations of the type sought here, which is required for ATI to develop
accurate data about the types of sUAS that are best suited for safe and effective operations. The
attached document "Information Supporting Petition" details the extent of relief and reason for
each FAR.
(d) The reasons why granting ATI's request would be in the public interest; that is,
how it would benefit the public as a whole
The proposal is designed to establish a reasonable methodology to test specific types and platforms
of sUAS, in a variety of environments, and to enable the safe and efficient deployment of commercial
sUAS for agricultural purposes. The outputs of safe, reliable, and regulatory compliant operations
of sUAS provide economic benefits historically unparalleled since the invention of flight, benefitting
stakeholders at every level, both public and private. Lawful, safe aerial robotics operations will cre-
ate new high-tech employment that will stimulate city and state governments; improve agriculture,
create new small and large businesses; infuse new interest in STEM for children; and increase the
safety of citizens through enhanced first-responder capabilities.
Specifically, sUAS-supported precision agriculture has the promise of dramatically increasing crop
yields by identifying which crops are ready to be harvested, reducing farming uncertainty by pro-
viding better data to inform yield estimates, and reducing inefficiencies in inputs by identifying
precisely where and when crops need to be treated or irrigated. Crops can even be protected from
depredation by birds by harmlessly shepherding the birds away from the fields. This is a much
more sustainable method of mitigating the impact of wildlife to crops than other methods. And
these are only a few of the many benefits that sUAS enabled precision agriculture will create and
are creating now.
In addition, sUAS-enabled infrastructure inspection directly reduces the risks incurred with tradi-
tional means of inspections - such suspending an inspector on a rope or raising them on a crane-
as well as decrease the costs associated with inspections. The decreased cost will not only provide
direct economic benefits to our clients in terms of cost savings, but the reduced cost will encourage
more frequent inspections.
Finally, aerial filming is widely performed by manned helicopters flying in close proximity to build-
ings, vehicles, film crews, and actors. In case of accident, the hazards posed by a helicopter in such
an environment are considerable. The FAA has found that the enhanced safety achieved using an
unmanned aircraft with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
                                                                                                                                            6

crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions and weight, carrying crew
in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.
Grant of this petition would enable the research and operational development of sUAS to enable the
safe and efficient acceleration of these significant public benefits to American farmers, consumers,
and to the United States public as a whole, and therefore is in the public interest.
(e) The reasons why granting the exemption would not adversely affect safety, or how
the exemption would provide a level of safety at least equal to that provided by the
rule from which ATI seeks the exemption
ATI operations will provide a level of safety that is equivalent to current aviation standards. ATI's
safety procedures, risk assessments, and flight operations standards are described in detail in the
accompanying ATI Operations Manual. In brief, the following procedures that apply during oper-
ations conducted under this exemption request, establish an equivalent level of safety (ELOS) as
follows:

   1. The ATI sUAS are less than 55 pounds with maximum speeds well under 100 mph.
   2. All ATI sUAS will be U.S. registered and display marks either in accordance with 14 C.F.R.

      Part 45, Subpart C or approved alternative markings.
   3. ATI sUAS operations under this exemption will be generally conducted within the visual line

      of sight of the pilot operator, at less than 400 feet AGL, and within Class G airspace. In
      addition, operations in controlled B,C, or D airspace will be conducted in coordination with
      ATC with prior permission.
   4. Consistent with the recently issued Section 333 Exemption No. 11062 (Astraeus Aerial) and
      others, ATI operations will be conducted in defined regions and over property authorized for
      this use by the landowner. All operations will remain within the geographic boundaries of
      the operating area. It is anticipated that most ATI operations may be conducted within the
      limitations of the blanket COA authorization provided with 333 grants as of 3­23­2015.
   5. sUAS operations under this exemption will be conducted under the supervision of a designated
      pilot in command (PIC) who has final responsibility for the operation and in accordance with
      14 C.F.R. 91.3. See the Pilot Requirements section below. All sUAS operators and observers
      must have completed training on the normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures in the
      ATI Manual, demonstrated proficiency with the sUAS being operated, and passed the Private
      Pilot FAA Ground School knowledge test. All ATI pilots will be required to pass a background
      check as provided by the TSA PreCheck program.
   6. Operators and engineers will maintain the sUAS system in a condition for safe operation
      according to the ATI Manual and associated manufacturer's maintenance manuals, including
      pre-flight and post-flight inspections.
   7. The PIC and observers will maintain situational awareness and perceive, process, and perform
      risk management prior to and during each operation as described in the ATI Manual. The
      PIC will terminate the operation in accordance with the ATI Manual if hazards that cannot
      be acceptably mitigated are observed.

ATI Petition  2
Section 1

Specific Exemption Requests

ATI's reasons and explanation for requesting each exemption are presented below. In addition, we describe how
we will maintain an equivalent level of safety to existing regulations for manual operation of manned aircraft,
insofar as existing regulations apply to sUAS or sUAS operations.

1.1 PART 61, CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND
       INSTRUCTORS

1.1.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

Part 61, all sections.

1.1.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

Because the UAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent level
of safety of current operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have at least a sport pilot's license
rather than a commercial pilot's license to operate these sUAS.

1.1.3 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the sUAS is remotely controlled with no living
thing on board. The area of operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in
advance as set forth in the GOM. The level of safety provided by the requirements included in the GOM exceeds
that provided by a single individual holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a conventional aircraft. The
risks associated with the operation of the sUAS are so diminished from the level of risk associated with commer-
cial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that allowing operations of the sUAS as requested with
a sport pilot certificate as the PIC exceeds the present level of safety achieved by 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) & (b).

1.2 §61.113 PRIVATE PILOT PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS: PILOT IN
       COMMAND.

1.2.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

Relief from requirement to possess a private or commercial pilot's license for aerial work such as aerial survey
and mapping.

                                                                       3
                                               May 4, 2015

1.2.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

§61.113 (a) stipulates that a holder of a private pilot certificate may not act as a pilot in command of an aircraft for
compensation or hire; (b) states that a private pilot may act as PIC if the flight is incidental to business and does
not carry passengers or property. Furthermore, N­8900.227 "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operational
Approval" paragraph 16(c)(2)(c) "Operations without a pilot certificate" states that a operations which conform
to said paragraph may be performed by a PIC that does not possess a private pilots license but that has completed
FAA private pilot ground instruction and passed the FAA Private Pilot written test. In addition, there is no means
currently of obtaining a commercial rating for UAS. Thus, we require relief in order to perform aerial work.

1.2.3 PUBLIC BENEFIT

As described above, the public benefit includes exponential economic growth, enhanced safety, and improved
precision agriculture capabilities.

1.2.4 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Our operations fullfill all the requirements in N­8900.227 16(c)(2)(c) for operations without a private pilots li-
cense.

1.3 §91.7 CIVIL AIRCRAFT AIRWORTHINESS.

1.3.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

91.7, all provisions.

1.3.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

Should the exemption be granted allowing commercial operation of the sUAS without an airworthiness certifi-
cate, no standard will exist for airworthiness of the sUAS.

1.3.3 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Given the size and weight of these aircraft and the requirements contained in the GOM, an equivalent level of
safety will be achieved by insuring compliance with the sUAS user manuals prior to each flight.

1.4 §91.119, MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDES: GENERAL.

1.4.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. 91.119(c) limits aircraft flying over areas
other than congested areas to an altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely
populated areas, and the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or
structure.

                                       May 4, 2015

1.4.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

To provide for these operations, the sUAS are normally operated at or below 400 feet AGL. In addition, due to
the nature of the proposed operations, the PIC and the observer may at times be less than 500 feet away from
structures during the operation.

1.4.3 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, and speed of the UAS as well as the lo-
cation where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the required permission of the property owner or
local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property owner and participants in the aerial activity, all
affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations. Compared to flight operations with aircraft
or rotorcraft weighing far more than the maximum 55lbs. described above and the lack of flammable fuel, any
risk associated with these operations is far less than those presently conducted with conventional aircraft op-
erating at or below 500 AGL in other industries. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the sUAS will ensure
separation between these sUAS operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with
Section 91.119.

1.5 §91.121 ALTIMETER SETTINGS

1.5.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

§91.121

1.5.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

As the sUAS may not have a barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be
needed.

1.5.3 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the Manual and Safety Check list,
confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

1.6 §91.151, FUEL REQUIREMENTS FOR FLIGHT IN VFR CONDITIONS.

1.6.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

§91.151, all provisions.

1.6.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

The provision requires fuel sufficient for one half hour flight beyond the destination. These sUAS, including to-
day's longest endurance platforms, are unable to meet this requirement because of limited max flight times.

                                  May 4, 2015

1.6.3 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights for the sUAS according to the safety limitations
described in the GOM. This restriction would be more than adequate to return the sUAS to its planned landing
zone from anywhere in its limited operating area.

1.7 §91.405, §91.407 §91.409 §91.417; INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE
       PROGRAMS

1.7.1 EXTENT OF RELIEF

§§ 91.405, Maintenance required; 91.407, Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,
or alteration; 91.409, Inspections; and 91.417, Maintenance records.

1.7.2 REASON FOR RELIEF

The part 91 provisions are not applicable to a sUAS of the described weight class. Furthermore, FAA certified
mechanics for sUAS do not at this present time exist, so full compliance is not possible. The sUAS flown are mod-
ular and as such entire components including engines and propellers are minor replacements rather than major
repairs. Finally, continuous minor alterations and payload reconfigurations of sUAS are designed and required
for the operation of sUAS and do not negatively impact airworthiness.

1.7.3 EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Inspection and maintenance manuals are used to maintain the sUAS in airworthy condition. Each sUAS is main-
tained according to the manufacturer standard or higher by technicians proficient in the building, repair, and
maintenance of the sUAS. Inspection and Maintenance manuals utilized contain all aircraft-relevant items as
described in (43 Appendix D (Scope and Detail of Items). Maintenance records are maintained in SkyWard Op-
erations Database Appendix B (Recording of Major Repairs and Major Alterations) and are therefore immedi-
ately auditable by regulators on demand. Finally, SkyWard manuals will be submitted to the local FSDO ASI or
other appropriate FAA division directly.
