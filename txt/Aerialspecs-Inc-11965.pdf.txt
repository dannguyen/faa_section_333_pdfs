                                                           Exemption No. 11965
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0222

Mr. Douglas Sigler
CEO and Owner
Aerialspecs, Inc.
48675 Jefferson Drive
Macomb, MI 48044

Dear Mr. Sigler:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter posted to the public docket on January 30, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Aerialspecs, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct remote visual line-of-sight videography, data collection, sensing, and visual
inspection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received two comments in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the Lockheed Martin Indago, DJI Phantom 3, DJI
Inspire 1, DJI S900, DJI S1000, and SenseFly eBee Ag.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Aerialspecs, Inc. is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Aerialspecs, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Lockheed Martin
         Indago, DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire 1, DJI S900, DJI S1000, and SenseFly eBee Ag
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
                                                                                                            4

    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;

SUMMARY

Pursuant to 14 CFR Part 11, the following summary is provided by Aerialspecs, Inc. for publication in the Federal
Register:

Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from the following regulations to operate small Unmanned Aerial Systems
for the purposes of remote visual line-of-sight videography, data collection, sensing, and visual inspection:

      14 CFR PART 61: Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors
      14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in Command
      14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 CFR §91.203 (a) (1)
      14 CFR §45.23 (b). Marking of the Aircraft
      14 CFR §91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness
      14 CFR §91.9 (b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft
      14 CFR §91.103 (b)(2): Preflight Action
      14 CFR §91.105: Flight Crewmembers at Stations
      14 CFR §91.109: Flight Instruction
      14 CFR §91.119: Minimum safe altitudes
      14 CFR §91.121: Altimeter Settings
      14 CFR §91.151: Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions
      14 CFR §91.203 (a) & (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration
      14 CFR §91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections

It is the position of Aerialspecs, Inc. that a new license class be created for the commercial visual line-of-sight of
sUAS. Many industries needlessly place the lives of employees in harm's way every day to keep the general public
safe and deliver products to their customers. Requiring reasonable everyday workers in hazardous jobs to obtain a
Pilot's license is too costly and time consuming. The rigor and cost associated to achieving a private pilots
certificate is typically $10,000 USD and 50 - 60 hours of an individual's time. This far exceeds the training necessary
to achieve a CDL with a Hazmat endorsement required to transport dangerous cargo over land.

Aerialspecs, Inc. believes it has created training, certifications, operational standards, and equipment specifications
that represent reasonable guidelines for operation of sUAS comparable to risk sUAS poses and similar to CDL,
forklift, or other hazardous equipment employees are entrusted to operate every day. Aerialspecs, Inc. is willing to
partner with the FAA to create a new license class leveraging this exemption as its springboard. Until then we
believe or training and certification standards, the type of equipment, operating standards, fly-off procedures, and
clear areas of operation defined herein exceed the standards set forth in FAA Advisory Circular AC 91-57 for hobby
operations and provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exceptions requested herein. This
satisfies the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 providing adequate justification for these
exceptions allowing for commercial operations of sUAS within visual line-of-sight by Aerialspecs, Inc.

Aerialspecs, Inc. is committed to the safety of the everyday worker and believes that through our services and this
exemption we can provide safe, quality operations of sUAS to reduce the risk to employees, improve our
customers OSHA ratings, and protect the public.

Petition for Exemption/Rulemaking to the FAA
Commercial visual line-of-sight sUAS operations

   EXEMPTION

       SCOPE

          The scope of this exemption includes Aerialspecs, Inc. employees, affiliates, partners, vendors, or any
          other person or entity operating in a flight capacity on behalf of Aerialspecs, Inc. for the purpose of
          commercial visual line-of-sight sUAS operations leveraging both manual command and control, and auto
          piloted flight.

       SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS

         14 CFR PART 61: CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND INSTRUCTORS

          The regulations set forth in 14 CFR Part 61 require a pilot certificate and medical certificate for anyone
          operating as a required pilot of a civil aircraft.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR Part 61 on the grounds that the FAA does not require a
          pilot certificate for recreational use of aerial vehicles with the same configurations hereunder today as
          defined by FAA Advisory Circular AC 91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards1. Also, the operation of
          sUAS is far simpler than large scale aircraft, especially with modern flight control and stabilization
          systems, requiring less training and experience to be safe and effective. Finally, there is no evidence to
          support the rigor of a pilot certificate, or lack thereof, makes the operations of sUAS more or less safe.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. exceeds the voluntary standards defined in FAA Advisory Circular AC 91-57 as well as
          maintains the equivalent level of safety intended by 14 CFR Part 61 by strictly following the Flight
          Operations Certification and General Operational Guidelines herein. Equipment Operators will have a
          minimum number of total flight hours overall, minimum number of total flight hours per sUAS type,
          minimum number of flight hours per year, knowledge of airspace and restrictions, aviation background
          checks, medical certification, and basic first aid training.

         14 CFR §61.113 (A) & (B): PRIVATE PILOT PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS: PILOT IN COMMAND

          These regulations limit private pilots to non-commercial operations only. Although Aerialspecs, Inc. is
          seeking exemption from certificates, ratings, and authorizations, it may still leverage licensed pilots to
          operate a sUAS. To not violate the regulations set forth in 14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b), an exemption is
          required.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b) on the grounds that the level of risk
          associated with the operation of a sUAS compared to commercial operations of a piloted aircraft when
          Part 61 was conceived is so negligible that having a private pilot as the Pilot In Command exceeds the
          present level of safety achieved by 14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b).

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will maintain an equivalent level of safety by operating a sUAS hereunder in specific
          operational areas away from the general public that will not carry passengers or crew, not exceed an
          operational weight of 24.9476 kg (55 lbs.) including payload, and not exceed ground speeds of 25 m/s (56
          mph).

Commercial visual line-of-sight sUAS operations

         14 CFR PART 21, SUBPART H: AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATES 14 CFR §91.203 (A) (1)

          This regulation requires that aircraft have a current certificate of airworthiness. It also requires that the
          airworthiness certificate be displayed in the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers
          and crew.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 CFR
          §91.203 (a) (1) on the grounds that a sUAS operated hereunder does not carry passengers or crew, will
          not weigh more than 24.9476 kg (55 lbs.) including payload, and will not exceed ground speeds of speeds
          of 25 m/s (56 mph). A sUAS hereunder will fly under strict guidelines in narrow operational areas. This
          combined with the safety measures herein provide a greater degree of safety to the public than
          conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart
          H. See Public Safety and General Operational Guidelines for more information.

          The Federal Aviation Act (49 USC §44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to
          exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size,
          weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular
          sUAS.

         14 CFR §45.23 (B): MARKING OF THE AIRCRAFT

          This regulation requires:

                        "When marks include only the Roman capital letter `N' and the registration number is
                        displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental or
                        provisionally certificated aircraft, the Equipment Operator must also display on that
                        aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2
                        inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words `limited,' `restricted,'' 'light-sport,'
                        `experimental,' or `provisional,' as applicable."

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR § 45.23 (b) on the grounds that sUAS operated
          hereunder do not have a cabin, cockpit or pilot station. Their size makes it impossible to fit the word
          "Experimental" in letting no smaller than 2 inches high. To maintain compliance with §45.29 (f),
          Aerialspecs, Inc. will require the word "Experimental" on sUAS fuselages so that the operator, spotter, or
          supporting personnel working with the vehicle will see the identification.

          Precedence has been set by the following exemptions issued by the FAA2: Exemptions Nos. 10700, 10167,
          and 10167A.

         14 CFR §91.7(A): CIVIL AIRCRAFT AIRWORTHINESS

          This regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.7(a) on the grounds that there will be no
          airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft. Should this exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory
          standard will exist for determining airworthiness for such vehicles.

          Given the size of the aircraft, the requirements contained in the equipment maintenance manuals, and
          use of safety check lists prior to each flight, an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

         14 CFR §91.9 (B) (2): CIVIL AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL IN THE AIRCRAFT

          This regulation requires that an approved Flight Manual, manual materials, markings, and place cards, or
          any combination thereof be placed in the aircraft and available to the pilot.

Petition for Exemption/Rulemaking to the FAA
Commercial visual line-of-sight sUAS operations

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.9 (b) (2) on the grounds that the sUAS operated
          hereunder have no cockpit and are not large enough to carry a Pilot or the Flight Manual.

          The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the ground control point
          where the Equipment Operator controlling the sUAS or the Observer will have immediate access to it.

          Precedence has been set by the following exemptions issued by the FAA3: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737,
          8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, and 10700.

         14 CFR §91.103(B)(2): PREFLIGHT ACTION

          This regulation requires the pilot in command to take certain action before a flight, specifically:

                        "(b) For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following takeoff
                        and landing distance information:

                        (1) For civil aircraft for which an approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual containing
                        takeoff and landing distance data is required, the takeoff and landing distance data
                        contained therein; and

                        (2) For civil aircraft other than those specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, other
                        reliable information appropriate to the aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under
                        expected values of airport elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind
                        and temperature."

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.103 on the grounds that there is no FAA approved
          Rotorcraft Flight Manual for the UAV. The Equipment Operator will follow a preflight checklist provided by
          the UAV manufacturer as well as validating UAV performance, battery requirement for the specific flight,
          landing and takeoff distances, area of operations, and weather conditions appropriate for VFR. See
          General Operational Guidelines for more information.

         14 CFR §91.105: FLIGHT CREWMEMBERS AT STATIONS

          This regulation requires that crewmember be at flight stations, presumably in the aircraft, wearing safety
          belts or harnesses during takeoff, landing, and while en route.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.105 on the grounds that sUAS operated hereunder
          have no cockpit and are not large enough to carry a Pilot. Aerialspecs, Inc. will provide the equivalent level
          of safety by requiring an Equipment Operator and Spotter for each sUAS in operation and require a
          securing strap between the C2 remote and the Equipment Operator.

         14 CFR §91.109: FLIGHT INSTRUCTION

          This regulation requires any civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) to have dual flight controls when
          used for flight instruction.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.109 on the grounds that sUAS are remotely
          controlled within line-of-sight and by design do not have dual controls. Flight control is accomplished
          through a microcontroller accepting human and/or software input that communicates flight commands
          via radio to the UAV. Aerialspecs, Inc. will provide the equivalent level of safety by the fact that neither
          Equipment Operator nor instructor will be onboard the UAV. It will also follow the General Operational
          Guidelines defined herein where the sUAS will be operated is specific, predefined areas, and the flight
          instruction behaving in the role of Chief Equipment Operator, will be present during instruction and have
          access to the controller.

Petition for Exemption/Rulemaking to the FAA
Commercial visual line-of-sight sUAS operations

          Precedence has been set by the following exemptions issued by the FAA4: Exemption Nos. 5778K &
          9862A.

         14 CFR §91.119: MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDES

          This regulation specifies the minimum altitudes of operation under various conditions including restricting
          operations below 152.4 m (500 Ft. AGL) over non-congested areas.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.119 under special circumstances on the grounds
          that many of the specific use cases defined herein have structures below 152.095 m (499 ft.) AGL and to
          gather relevant information on said structure the UAV must operate well below specified minimums.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will provide the equivalent level of safety by flying in specific areas of operation away
          from the general public. The equipment will not carry any hazardous or explosive cargo, travel no more
          than 25 m/s (56 mph), and not exceed 24.9476 kg (55 lbs.) in operational weight including payload. The
          Equipment Operator and Spotter will also be equipped with aviation radios to communicate with nearby
          traffic. The details of the flight will be publicly publish on the Aerialspecs, Inc. corporate web site
          indicating the location, two dimensional operational area, maximum altitude, start time, and expected
          duration.

         14 CFR §91.121: ALTIMETER SETTINGS

          This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by reference to an
          altimeter that is set:

                     "(iii) In the case of an aircraft not equipped with a radio, the elevation of the departure
                     airport or an appropriate altimeter setting available before departure; "

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.121 on the grounds that some of the aircraft used
          rely strictly on GPS for altitude and those aircraft that have an altimeter will auto calibrate ground level to
          the atmospheric pressure at time of startup.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will provide an equivalent level of safety by including in the preflight checklist verification
          that GPS fix is sufficient to maintain altitude within a reasonable margin of error, that the GPS altitude is
          correct before flight, or in case of barometric altimeter based aircraft, that the altimeter reads 0 m (0 ft.)
          AGL before flight.

         14 CFR §91.151: FUEL REQUIREMENTS FOR FLIGHT IN VFR CONDITIONS

          This regulation requires:

                        "(a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless (considering
                        wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of
                        intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed--

                        (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or
                        (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

                        (b) No person may begin a flight in a rotorcraft under VFR conditions unless (considering
                        wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of
                        intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly after that for at least 20
                        minutes."

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.151 on the grounds that sUAS operated hereunder
          generally have battery limits of approximately 20-60 minutes depending on atmospheric conditions,

          make, model, and age of the battery. In some cases this would provide no reserve capability, in others,
          leaving not enough flight time to gather the information required for the visual inspection of the wind
          turbine.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will maintain an equivalent level of safety by flying in specific areas of operation away
          from the general public. The equipment will not carry any hazardous or explosive cargo, travel no more
          than 25 m/s (56 mph), and not exceed 24.9476 kg (55 lbs.) in operational weight including payload. Flight
          operations will cease when battery levels reach 15% of their startup capacity. This restriction will provide
          ample battery life for the UAV to return to its designated landing area.

          Precedence has been set by the following exemptions issued by the FAA5: Exemptions Nos. 10673, 2689F,
          5745, 10673, and 10808.

         14 CFR §91.203 (A) & (B): CARRYING CIVIL AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION AND REGISTRATION

          This regulation requires in part:

                        "(a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has
                        within it the following:

                        (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

                        (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
                        paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is
                        displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew."

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.203 (a) & (b) on the grounds that the sUAS at full
          operations weight will be less than 24.9476 kg (55 lbs.) including payload, has no cockpit, and has no
          room to carry a pilot onboard.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will maintain an equivalent level of safety by keeping these documents at the ground
          control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to them; to the extent they are
          applicable to the sUAS.

          Precedence has been set by the following exemptions issued by the FAA6: Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665,
          9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

         14 CFR §91.405 (A); 407 (A) (1); 409 (A) (2); 417(A) & (B): MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS

           These regulations require that each owner or operator:

                        "Shall have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between
                        required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have
                        discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter;"

          Aerialspecs, Inc. is seeking exemption from 14 CFR §91.405 (a), 407 (a) (1), 409 (a) (2), and 417(a) and (b)
          on the grounds that these regulations and the regulations set forth in Part 43 are intended for aircraft
          with airworthiness certificates and a sUAS hereunder will not be issued an airworthiness certificate.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will maintain an equivalent level of safety by operating a sUAS hereunder in specific
          operational areas away from the general public that will not carry passengers or crew, not exceed an
          operational weight of 24.9476 kg (55 lbs.) including payload, and not exceed ground speeds of 25 m/s (56
          mph). Should a mechanical issue arise the sUAS can immediately land within the operational area.

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will also perform routine and scheduled inspections of all sUAS and follow the
          maintenance recommendations of the equipment manufacturer. A log of all maintenance and repair will
          be kept for each sUAS to ensure the highest operational performance.

          Per the Operational Procedures herein, all flights will perform a pre-flight and post-flight checklists which
          will include visual inspection of the equipment to identify anomalies before they become an issue. See
          Maintenance and Repair for more information on the maintenance and repair of sUAS by Aerialspecs, Inc.

   PUBLIC SAFETY

          Aerialspecs, Inc. will follow these specific safety measures to ensure the safety of our employees and the
          general public:

                 A sUAS operated hereunder will remain confined to an operational area.
                 No flight operations will occur inside restricted or special use, airspace.
                 No flight operations will occur inside Class B, C, or D airspace with the following conditions:

                           o No flight operations will occur within a 5 nm (9260 m) radius of a Class A airport in Class

         EQUIPMENT OPERATOR AND SPOTTER FLIGHT TIME REQUIREMENTS

          The equipment operator and spotter must 8 hours of flight time logged checked off by a Chief Equipment
          Operator to obtain a Flight Operation Certification. Once certified an Equipment Operator or Spotter will
          have an 8 hour flight time probation where they cannot be partnered with another Equipment Operator
          or Spotter who is on probation. Those 8 hours of flight will be logged and checked off by the experienced
          Equipment Operator or Spotter not on probation.

          To maintain Flight Operations Certification an Equipment Operator or Spotter must log at least 10 hours
          of operational time, either on-the-job or practice, annually, excluding the flight time logged during the
          initial Flight Operations Certification checks.

                 There will be a daily Mission Briefing conducted by a Chief Equipment Officer evaluating weather,
                     AIRMET/SIGMET, SUA, TFR, and other factors to determine flights and flight windows for the day.

                 A Chief Equipment Operator will monitor all restricted or Special Use Airspace, TFR, and
                     AIRMET/SIGMET restrictions taking the appropriate actions with the Equipment Operator.

                 All planned flight operations will be made publically available on the Aerialspecs, Inc. corporate
                     web site with the exception of Municipal Police operations of extreme circumstance. The
                     information published will include:
                           o The date, time, and duration of the operations.
                           o The geographical position of the operational area.
                           o The type of equipment being used.

                 There will be an Equipment Operator and Spotter for each UAV during flight operations.
                 A Chief Equipment Operator, Equipment Operator, or Spotter may cancel or abort a flight at any

                     time for any reason. The Equipment Operator and Spotter have the responsibility to abort the
                     flight should the situation arise.
                 All flight operations require a Chief Equipment Operator or Equipment Operator, and Spotter
                     present per sUAS in operation.
                 The Equipment Operator and Spotter will have in their possession the ability to communicate
                     with aircraft in the area via Aviation Radio.
                 A Mission briefing will be conducted to identify local hazards and plan of action to meet the
                     objectives of the flight.
                 A designated takeoff and landing point will be identified and clearly marked as a hazard with
                     cones, flags, or some other obvious means. This point will also be set as the "return to home"
                     point of the UAV.
                 A pre-flight check will be conducted per the equipment manufacturer and any standards set
                     forth by Aerialspecs, Inc.
                 The Equipment Operator and Spotter will remain in constant communication during operations
                     via voice or radio. In the event that communications between the Equipment Operator and
                     Spotter are lost, flight operations shall cease with a controlled landing of the UAV until
                     communications can be established.
                 Should unauthorized personnel or a member of the general public enter the operational area,
                     either on land, sea, or in the air during sUAS operations, flight operations shall cease with a safe,
                     controlled landing of the UAV until the hazard has cleared.

                           o All other air traffic in or near the operational area will have the right of way and
                                appropriate action will be taken by the Equipment Operator to avoid the traffic.

                 sUAS operations hereunder will comply with FAA §91.155 Basic VFR weather minimums7 for
                     daytime operations for Class G airspace and follow typical "see and avoid" standards during
                     operations.

                 No sUAS will be flown in weather conditions that exceed FAA §91.155 Basic VFR weather
                     minimums7 for daytime operations for Class G airspace or the operational envelope set forth by
                     the equipment manufacture.

                 Flight operations will cease with a safe, controlled landing of the UAV at the designated landing
                     point when battery onboard the UAV reaches 15% of its capacity.

                 The Equipment Operator and Spotter will conduct a Mission Debriefing when flight operations
                     have been completed to document and share any learnings during the flight.

                 The Equipment Operator will log the flight when operations have been completed.
          For detailed information on the process see Appendix A. General Flight Process below. Figure 1.1 depicts
          the area of operations in Class B, C, or D airspace with floor of SFC neear a Class A airport.

             Fig. 1.1 Example area of operations inside Class B, C, or D airspace with a Class A airport. No flight operations are permitted within 5
             nautical miles. Flight operations within the 12 nautical mile Class B airspace SFC to 10,000 ft. (3048 m) AGL will be restricted to
             maximum altitude of 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL.

       FLY-OFF PROCEDURES

          In the unlikely event of loss of control or communications with a UAV resulting in un-commanded flight
          outside the operational area where all other attempts to abort the flight have failed, the following
          procedures will be followed:

                 The Equipment Operator will immediately contact the ATC responsible for the airspace the
                     operations are in to notify them of the hazard. The Equipment Operator will provide ATC with
                     the following information:
                           o Last known position of the UAV.
                           o The last known situation: altitude AGL, ground speed, and heading.
                           o The operational weight of the UAV.
                           o The estimated flight time remaining.
                           o Any defining characteristics of the UAV to help in locating and identifying the vehicle in
                                flight.

                 The Equipment Operator will contact the Chief Equipment Operator to log the incident.
                 The Equipment Operator will provide periodic updates the ATC responsible for the airspace

                     providing information, if telemetry is available, until UAV is recovered or the estimated flight
                     time remaining has expired.
                 The Equipment Operator will contact the ATC responsible for the airspace once the UAV is
                     recovered or the estimated flight time remaining has expired to inform them the hazard no
                     longer exists.
                 The Equipment Operator will contact the Chief Equipment Operator once the UAV is recovered,
                     or the estimated flight time remaining has expired, to close the incident.

   SPECIFIC USE CASES

          Below are the specific use cases Aerialspecs, Inc. is intending to operate under. Each use case describes
          how the sUAS will be used as well as the operational area, and any additional safety measures unique to
          the use case. In the event that a specific use cases operational area conflicts with the constraints defined
          in the Operating Standards herein, those constraints defined in the Operating Standards will take
          precedence.
          In the event the size of an operational area exceeds the range constraints defined in the Operational
          Standards herein the mission will be broken up into multiple sorties.

       WIND TURBINE CONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION

          Using sensors, video and still image surveillance, a sUAS will be used to visually inspect the easements,
          tower, nacelle, blades, and hub in multiple EM spectrums for the purposes of routine inspection, damage
          verification, restoration planning, 3D site mapping, and flood and drainage monitoring of easements on
          privately owned farms.
          Aerialspecs, Inc. will also experiment with probes that can take measurements on engineering points on
          wind turbine blades. These measurements will typically be impedance measurement to validate that
          blade lightning arrester systems are in good operating condition.
          Prior to turbine construction a sUAS will be used to fly the complete blade sweeping area of a planned
          turbine. Leveraging an attached strobe light, aerial and ground video, point clouds, and computer
          simulation, Aerialspecs, Inc. can ensure the visibility of a wind turbine to the property owners before
          committing to an agreement with the operator.

         OPERATIONAL AREA

          For inspection of an existing turbine the UAV will operate within a 600 ft. (182.88 m) horizontal radius of
          the wind turbine center with a maximum altitude of 400 ft. (1221.92 m) AGL. If the wind turbine is over
          400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL, then the maximum altitude will be no more than 50 ft. (15.24 m) above the tip of
          the airfoil fully extended above the nacelle. In the State of Michigan, that is typically no more than 550 ft.
          (167.64 m) AGL as the majority of wind turbines are no more than 499 ft. (152.1 m) AGL. The UAV will also
          operate over the easements designated as access to the wind turbine. In such a case the UAV will not fly
          more 50 ft. (15.24 m) on either side from the center line of the easement and no more than 100 ft. (30.48
          m) AGL in height. Figure 2.1 depicts the operational area for a wind turbine inspection.

          AGL. If the wind turbine is over 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL, then the maximum altitude will be no more than
          50 ft. (15.24 m) above the tip of the airfoil fully extended above the nacelle. In the State of Michigan, that
          is typically no more than 550 ft. (167.64 m) AGL as the majority of wind turbines are no more than 499 ft.

         ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES

                 The wind turbine must be shut down, in a locked configuration to prevent wing feathering,
                     nacelle, or blade rotation, and tagged as "personnel on site" or other relevant protective tagging
                     that would prevent the turbine or its operators from starting it up during sUAS operations.

                 Under certain circumstances the nature of the fault may prevent the turbine from being
                     completely passivated. In those situations operations may commence provided that:
                           o The hub, blades, or nacelle are damaged in a manner that would likely prevent the
                                blades rotation.
                           o The tower has collapsed.
                           o The nacelle is directed into the wind and the wings are feathered to minimize rotation.
                           o The operator has physically secured the turbine on sight.

                 No members of the general public will be permitted in the operational area during operations
                     with appropriate signage on display.

         PAYLOAD

         ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES

                 No sUAS will operate in an explosive atmosphere environment.
                 No bridge, span, or structure that crosses over a roadway designated as a Highway by the Federal

                     or State government the roadway is in will be inspected unless the highway has been closed in
                     the operational area.
                 The EM spectrum of antennas, buildings, bridges, structures, or spans containing transmitting
                     equipment will be evaluated for interference of the C2 systems of the sUAS and vice versa.
                 Equipment with intake or exhaust ports, or transmitters will be shut down before de-nesting
                     operations will occur.
                 Equipment tied to smoke stacks or chimneys to be inspected will be shut down before internal
                     inspections occur.
                 Due to the nature of visibility in major metropolitan areas special handling of heliports will be
                     taken. No sUAS operations in a major metropolitan area will occur within 1 statute mile (1.6 km)
                     of a heliport without informing the owner of the heliports of the sUAS operations. This
                     communication will include:

                           o Date, time, and duration of the mission.
                           o Location of the operations.
                           o Operational area.
                           o Planned equipment to be used.
                           o How to contact the Equipment Operator and Spotter for the mission.
                 Sidewalks, bike paths, and any other pedestrian pathways inside the operational area will have
                     appropriate warning signs, rope, tape, or other signaling methods to cordon off the area.
                 If a bridge or span can carry pedestrian traffic, the bridge or span must be closed to pedestrians.
                 If a bridge or span is for vehicle traffic the UAV will not be flown over the roadway with the
                     exception of the tower sections. It will be flown outside the guardrail, main cables, hangers, or
                     underneath the roadway.
                 Operations over roadways around bridge or span tower sections will not be conducted if wind
                     gusts exceed 20 MPH (8.94 m/s).

       MUNICIPAL POLICE, FIRE, AND SEARCH AND RESCUE

          Using audio, video, and still image surveillance a sUAS will be used to provide live visual, audio, telemetry
          information to Police, Fire, Search and Rescue personnel during major incidents such as bomb threats,
          major vehicle accident involving hazardous materials, infrastructure or building collapse, flooding,
          mudslide, landslide, hostage situation, or any other incident that poses an immediate threat to the health,
          lives, or safety of the general public or emergency response personnel. When equipped, the sUAS may
          also be used to provide live audio via directional microphone or active laser listening device where
          allowed by law. Aerialspecs, Inc. will experiment with other sensors including radiological, biological, and
          chemical as well.
          A sUAS will be used to generate point clouds for 3D mapping and monitoring of flood zones, rubble piles,
          or measuring spills.
          Aerialspecs, Inc. will experiment with using a sUAS to tow a rescue rope or drop flotation devices to
          people during water or ice rescue.

         OPERATIONAL AREA

          The operational area will be defined by the Incident Commander handling the response. A typical
          operational area for a Police or Fire incident will be any suburban or metropolitan public, commercial,
          industrial, or residential property. In the case of buildings or structure the operational area is no more
          than 100 ft. (30.48 m) horizontally from the building or structures property line and a maximum altitude
          of 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL. If the building or structure is over 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL, including the 50 ft.
          (15.24 m) buffer, then the operational area will be a maximum altitude of 50 ft. (15.24 m) above the
          tallest part of the building or structure and 100 ft. (30.48 m) horizontally from the building or structure
          down to 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL. Below 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL, the horizontal operational area will then
          extend to 100 ft. (30.48 m) from the building or structures property line. For the safety of the Equipment
          Operator and Spotter the horizontal area may be extended to 1000 ft. (304.8 m) from the incident area.
          Figure 7.1 depicts the operational are for a Police or Fire incident. Figure 7.2 depicts the operational area
          for search and rescue.

             Fig. 7.2 Operational area for search and rescue.

          For broader operations such as damage assessment, impact analysis, or search and rescue the operational
          area will be defined by the Incident Commander handling the response with a maximum altitude of 400 ft.
          (121.92 m) AGL.
          Over a highway, the operational area will be 1000 ft. (304.8 m) radius around the approximate center of
          the Incident area with a maximum altitude of 400 ft. (121.92 m) AGL. Per the Additional Safety Measures
          defined hereunder, a 300 foot (91.44 m) barrier or buffer must be established and the highway must be
          closed.

             Fig. 7.3 Operational area over highway. Due to the nature of hazardous or explosive cargo sometimes shipped over highways, an
             sUAS may have to enter anywhere from up to 1000 ft. (304.8 m) away for increased safety to the Equipment Operator and Spotter.
             Note the 300 ft. (91.44) barrier established in the Incident Area depicted in red.

         ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES

                 No sUAS will operate in an explosive atmosphere environment.
                 No operations will occur while any other police, fire, or search and rescue aerial vehicles are

                     operating in response to the incident.

                 The agency handling the response to the incident will designate the Incident Commander on
                     scene as the liaison between the agency and the Equipment Operator and Spotter.
                           o The Incident Commander will be responsible for obtaining the necessary warrants,
                                permits, exemptions, authorizations, or licenses to operate sUAS for the situation.
                           o The Incident Commander will have the same authority to abort or cancel a flight as the
                                Equipment Operator and Spotter.
                           o The Incident Commander must be in constant communication with the Equipment
                                Operator and Spotter via voice or radio during Operations. In the event that
                                communications between the Equipment Operator and Incident Commander are lost,
                                flight operations shall cease with a controlled landing of the UAV until communications
                                can be established.

                 The Equipment Operator and Spotter will operate under the guidelines of the National Incident
                     Management System as governed by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

                 Personal protection equipment appropriate for the situation will be specified by the liaison and
                     used by employees at all times during operations. Examples include respirators, flame retardant
                     clothing, or ballistics vests.

                 Due to the nature of visibility in major metropolitan areas special handling of heliports will be
                     taken. No sUAS operations in a major metropolitan area will occur within 1 statute mile (1.6 km)
                     of a heliport without informing the owner of the heliports of the sUAS operations. This
                     communication will include:
                           o Date, time, and duration of the mission.
                           o Location of the operations.
                           o Operational area.
                           o Planned equipment to be used.
                           o How to contact the Equipment Operator and Spotter for the mission.

                 A UAV never be used to restrain, detain, subdue, or physically engage an individual. In the case of
                     water or ice rescue, a UAV may be used to tow a lead line to, or drop a flotation device near an
                     individual in a manner that minimizes the risk of contact with the individual.

                 Every attempt will be made by the Equipment Operator to access the incident area with the UAV
                     via easements or public property, avoiding flying over private property except in extreme cases.

                 No sUAS operations will occur over any roadway designated a Highway by Federal or State
                     Government the roadway is in unless the Highway has been closed at the point of the incident
                     and a minimum 300 ft. (91.44 m) safety zone has been established around the incident.

         PAYLOAD

                 Passive video and/or still imaging equipment in various electromagnetic spectrums including IR,
                     NIR, visible light, terahertz, and UV.

                 Environmental Monitoring Sensors including but not limited to radiological, biological, chemical,
