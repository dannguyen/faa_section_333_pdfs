                                                           Exemption No. 11896
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015-1247

Mr. Eric Gakstatter
Discovery Management Group, LLC
19760 Bellevue Way
PO Box 663
West Linn, OR 97068

Dear Mr. Gakstatter:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 3, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Discovery Management Group, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial mapping, photography, filmmaking, and photogrammetry.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
                                                                                                                 2

consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Discovery Management Group, LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Discovery Management Group, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions

Re: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act of the Federal Aviation
Regulations from 14 C.F.R. Part 21; 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 91.9(b) (2);

C.F.R. 417(a)&(b)

Dear Sir or Madam,

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the
"Reform Act") and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Discovery Management Group, LLC
("Discovery"), the owner and operator of the DJI Phantom 2 quad-copter Unmanned
Aircraft System (UAS), seeks an exemption from the Federal Aviation Regulations
("FARs") listed below so that Discovery can operate our small ultra-light weight UAS
commercially in airspace regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA").
Discovery will utilize an experienced, licensed pilot holding an FAA third-class airman
medical certificate as the operator1 (Pilot in Charge [PIC]) and a visual observer (VO)2
that can perform the functions prescribed in the operating manual for all flights under this
Exemption, if granted.

The requested exemption would support an application for a commercial Certificate of
Authorization to use the system to perform aerial mapping to enhance academic
community awareness, augment real estate listing videos, filmmaking, golf course
mapping, agricultural mapping, and photogrammetry for various industries.

Use of the DJI Phantom 2 UAS for aerial mapping reduces the need to operate
conventional aircraft for the same purpose and provides very high quality imagery at a
fraction of the dollar cost and danger to human life34 of using conventional aircraft. By

1 See Appendix A for PIC qualifications and certifications.
2 Note; the VO will not be operating the UAS.
3 See National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 2000. U.S. Civil Rotorcraft Accidents, 1963
Through 1997. http://www.ihst.org/portals/54/industry_reports/NASA%20TP%20209597.pdf

                                                                                                           1
approving these exemptions, the FAA will create benefits through safer survey methods
by UAS, resulting in decreased potential for loss of life and enhanced efficiency and
productivity for the affected activities, as well as environmental benefits, which are all
ultimately in the public interest.

Committed to safety with each flight, Discovery's, exemption request would permit
operation of ultra-light weight, unmanned (piloted by remote control) and comparatively
inexpensive UAS in tightly controlled and limited airspace. Currently, similar lightweight,
remote controlled UAS's are legally operated by unmonitored amateur hobbyists with no
safety plan or controls in place to prevent catastrophe. In addition, Douglas Trudeau
(Exemption No. 11138) and Slugwear, Inc (Like On A Tree; Exemption No. 11157) were
granted exemptions for these types of surveys with the DJI Phantom 2.

Discovery has created and will follow its UAS Flight Protocols and Controls5 for safe
operation to avoid and prevent public hazard, as well as manned aircraft
hazards/catastrophe. This will act to further safety protocols exclusive to lightweight
UAS's specific video and photography usage as Discovery records flight data and other
information gained through permitted flight operations to share with the FAA through any
required FAA reports to assist with future protocol and safety regulation.

Granting Discovery's request comports with the Secretary of Transportation's (FAA
Administrator's) responsibilities and authority to not only integrate UAS's into the national
airspace system, but to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems [UAS's] in the national airspace system" under Section 333(c) of the Reform Act
specific to the use of UAS's for real estate/Realtor purposes. Further, Discovery, will
conduct its own operations in compliance with the protocols described herein or as
otherwise established by the FAA.

For the reasons stated below, Discovery, respectfully request the grant of an exemption
allowing Discovery to operate ultra-light weight, remote controlled UAS's for community
awareness, enhance real estate listing videos for homeowners, filmmaking, golf course
mapping, agricultural mapping, and photogrammetry for various industries. All of which
will promote local economic growth through increased employment and increased tax
base. Both with public safety in mind by keeping heavier manned aircraft containing
combustible fuel that that poses potential public hazard.

III. The Extent of relief Discovery seeks and the Reason Discovery Seeks
Such Relief:
Discovery submits this application in accordance with the Reform Act, 112 P.L. 95 §§
331-334, seeking relief from any currently applicable FARs operating to prevent
Discovery contemplated commercial cinematic, academic and other flight operations
within the national airspace system. The Reform Act in Section 332 provides for such
integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into our national airspace system as it is in
the public's interest to do so. Discovery's, ultra-light weight UAS meets the definition of
"small unmanned aircraft" as defined in Section 331 and therefore the integration of
Discovery's ultra-light weight UAS is expressly contemplated by the Reform Act.
Discovery would like to operate its ultra-light weight UAS prior to the time period by
which the Reform Act requires the FAA to promulgate rules governing such craft.
Thereby, providing direct experience and valuable information for formal regulation that
can be administered uniformly to all agriculture, mapping, and real estate related UAS
aerial video and photography.

The Reform Act guides the Secretary in determining the types of UAS's that may operate
safely in our national airspace system. Considerations include: The weight, size, speed
and overall capabilities of the UAS's; Whether the UAS will be operated near airports or
heavily populated areas; and, Whether the UAS will be operated by line of sight. 112
P.L. 95 § 333 (a). Each of these items reflect in favor of an exemption for Discovery.
Discovery's UAS utilizes four (4) counter-rotating propellers for balance, control and
stability. Weighing less than five (5) pounds (far below the maximum 55 pound limit);
including camera with gimbal. Discovery's UAS is equipped with a compass, GPS, auto
return safety technology if communication is lost between the UAS and the controller,
Real-Time Fight Data Display6, and a No Fly Zone7 software default setting to force the
device to abide by International Civil Aviation Organization regulations.

Discovery considers safety as foremost with each flight. Discovery's small UAS is
designed to hover in place via GPS and operate in less than a 24 knot (15 mph) wind.
For safety, stability and fear of financial loss, Discovery will not fly in winds exceeding 16
kph (10 mph) nor exceed an indicated airspeed of 29 knots (15 m/s). Built-in safety

the PIC.
7 DJI's "No Fly Zone": Two classes in this mode limit the DJI Phantom 2's ability to fly near restricted
airport air space. Class A will not allow the UAS to take off within 1.5 miles of the GPS location of an
airport. Class B will has incorporated an increasing height limit from 35 feet AGL at 1.5 miles from an
airport, increasing to 400 feet at 5 miles an airport. The UAS control system will also automatically
warn the PIC when the UAS has approached within 330 feet of the 5-mile buffer zone around an
airport. This software will also not allow the user to set GPS waypoints within 5 miles of the 5-mile
No Fly Zone around an airport. For further details, visit http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-mc.

                                                                                                           4
systems include a GPS mode that allows Discovery's UAS to hover in place when radio
controls are released. With three modes to choose from, Discovery will utilize the Smart
Mode for aerial videography/photography. This is the safest, most reliable and stable
mode to prevent accident and hazard. When PIC communication is lost, Discovery's
UAS is designed to slowly descend to point of take-off (Return to Home). Discovery will
not operate the UAS near Airports, Hospitals, nor Police heliports, and will not operate
near areas where general public is within fifty to one hundred (50-100) yards depending
on location, conditions and weather. Discovery's PIC and VO will be on constant alert for
any manned aircraft (Police/Medical helicopters, etc.) or other UAS, and prepared to
land/abort immediately to the nearest and safest ground point should a manned aircraft
or UAS approach Discovery's location, or Discovery suspects manned aircraft or UAS
may approach near our location. Discovery's UAS is capable of vertical and horizontal
operations, and is only flown within the line of sight of both the PIC and VO.

Utilizing battery power rather than combustible fuels, flights with Discovery's UAS
generally last between five (5) to seven minutes, with an altitude under 400 feet.
Discovery will utilize a fresh fully charged battery with each flight as a safety precaution;
full flight time limit for each battery is nine (9) to 12 minutes as tested. Discovery will not
operate our UAS at or below manufacturer recommend minimum charge levels for
operation; preferring to remain well within a safe operating range to insure adequate
communication between radio control and UAS to eliminate potential for crash, loss of
control or hazard. Reserve batteries are at hand with each exercise to insure
replacement for sufficient safe level of operation.

Discovery does not believe in taking risk that may cause a crash that could create
hazard to the public/property/manned aircraft, and have no desire to lose an investment.
Discovery has clocked numerous practice flights in remote areas as a hobbyist
simulating flights for future commercial use to gain familiarization with the characteristics
of this specific UAS's performance under different temperature and weather conditions.
Discovery also practices computerized simulated flights to maintain adequate skills and
response reflex time, for the sake of safety.

Discovery is extremely cautious when operating any UAS and will not "create a hazard
to users of the national airspace system or the public." 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (b).

Given the small size and weight of Discovery's UAS, it falls well within Congress's
contemplated safety zone when it promulgated the Reform Act and the corresponding
directive to integrate UAS's into the national airspace system. Discovery's UAS, used in
hobby flight, has a demonstrable safety record and does not pose any threat to the
general public or national security.

IV. How Discovery's Request Will Benefit the Public As A Whole:
Aerial videography for geographical awareness in real estate, filmmaking, golf course
mapping, agricultural mapping, and photogrammetry for various industries has been
around for a long time through manned fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. For small
budget companies, farms and average homeowners, the expense of manned aerial
videography is cost prohibitive. Only large companies can afford to absorb such
expense, this depriving the remainder of the public from a valuable marketing and
mapping tool. Manned aircraft pose a threat to the public through potential catastrophic
crash that Oregon has experienced in the past with private and public officials involved

                                                                                                           5
in crashes in recent years8. Furthermore, Discovery's PIC, Eric Gakstatter, is an editor
for GPS World magazine and Geospatial Solutions. He has written several articles on
UAS and intends to continue writing such articles to raise awareness and education of
productive and safe UAS operations.

Congress has already proclaimed that it is in the public's interest to integrate
commercially flown UAS's into the national airspace system, hence the passing of the
Reform Act. Granting Discovery's exemption request furthers the public interest through
academic/visual awareness of the geographical benefits around Oregon. Discovery's
ultra-light weight UAS is battery-powered and creates no emissions that can harm the
environment. The consequence of my ultra-light weight UAS crashing is far less than a
full size helicopter or fixed wing aircraft; which are heavy, contain combustible fuel and
can cause catastrophic devastation to the public.

The public's interest is furthered by minimizing ecological and crash threat by permitting
aerial video/photo capture through our battery operated ultra-light weight UAS's.
Permitting Discovery to immediately fly within national air space furthers economic
growth by offering cost-effective videography and mapping products.

V. Reasons Why Discovery's Exemption Will Not Adversely Affect Safety Or
How The Exemption Will Provide a Level of Safety At Least Equal To
Existing Rule:
Discovery's exemption will not adversely affect safety. Quite the contrary, for the
reasons stated, permitting Discovery to log more flight time in FAA controlled airspace,
with communication with the FAA, will allow us to contribute to the innovation and
implementation of new and novel techniques for realtors, filmmaking, golf courses,
agricultural mapping, and photogrammetry for various industries as well as continuing to
educate the public through publishing articles. In addition, Discovery submits the
following representations of enhancements to current aerial videography and
photography for real estate, filmmaking, golf courses, agricultural mapping, and
photogrammetry for various industries:

     Discovery's UAS weighs less than 5 pounds complete with a small ultra-light
         weight high quality GoPro 4 Black camera;

     Discovery will only operate this UAS below 400 feet, as recommended by the
         FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012;

     Discovery's UAS will only operate for 10 minutes per flight;
     Discovery will land this UAS prior to manufacturer recommended minimum level

         of battery power, 30% battery power remaining. Also, Discovery's UAS has an
         automated function which results in immediate landing when a low battery is
         detected;
     Discovery will pilot this UAS through remote control by line of sight;
     Discovery's UAS has GPS-controlled autopilot system to maintain UAS stability
         and control,
     Discovery's UAS has an Auto Return-to-Home & Landing function to increase

         safe return of the UAS to the ground,
     A pre-programmed flight safety feature whereby Discovery's UAS automatically

         hovers and then slowly lands if communication with the remote control pilot is
         lost;
     Discovery will actively analyze flight data and other sources of information to
         constantly update and enhance safety protocols;
     Discovery will only operates in reasonably safe environments that are strictly
         controlled and are away from: power lines, elevated lights, airports and actively
         populated areas;
     Discovery will conduct extensive pre-flight inspections and protocol review,
         during which safety carries primary importance;
     Any maintenance or alterations of Discovery's UAS that could affect operation or
         flight characteristics will require a functional test flight before returning to work;
     Discovery will always obtain all necessary permissions prior to operation,
         including issuing a notice-to-airmen (NOTAM) prior to operations; and,
     Discovery will have procedures in place to abort flights in the event of safety
         breaches or potential danger.
     In recognition of the FAA's Exemption No. 11062, and specifically Exemption No.
         11138 for the same UAS model (DJI Phantom 2); prior to conducting operations
         for the purpose of aerial photography/videography, Discovery's PIC will have
         accumulated 25 hours of total time as a UAS rotorcraft pilot including at least 10
         hours as a UAS pilot with a multi-rotor UAS. Prior to operations, Discovery's PIC
         must also have accumulated a minimum of 5 hours as a UAS pilot operation the
         DJI Phantom 2. In addition to the hour requirements, the PIC must accomplish 3
         take-offs and landings in the preceding 90 days (for currency purposes).

Discovery's, safety protocols provide a level of safety equal to or exceeding existing
rules. It is important to note that absent the integration of commercial UAS into our
national airspace system, helicopters are the primary means of aerial video and
photography for community awareness and real estate. While the safety record of such
helicopters is astounding, there has been local incidents involving loss of life as well as
extensive property damage; it is far safer to operate a battery powered ultra-light weight
UAS.

     First, the potential loss of life is diminished because UAS's carry no people on
         board and Discovery will only operate its UAS in specific areas away from mass
         populations.

     Second, there is no fuel on board a UAS and thus the potential for fire or
         explosions is greatly diminished.

     Third, the small size and extreme maneuverability of Discovery's UAS allow the
         PIC to remotely pilot away from and avoid hazards quickly and safely.Lastly,
         given its small size and weight, even when close enough to capture amazing
         images, Discovery's UAS need not be so close to the objects they are focused
         on through the technology and use of post editing software allowing pan and
         zoom.

Accordingly, Discovery's UAS has been experimentally operated for
familiarization/competency and will continue to operate at and above current safety
levels. Furthermore, Discovery's PIC has accumulated 25 hours of total time as a UAS

                                                                                                           7

operation the DJI Phantom 2.

VI. A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:
A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like.

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth
requirements for procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation
to FAR § 91.203(a)(1). The size, weight and enclosed operational area of
Discovery's UAS permits exemption from Part 21 because Discovery's UAS
meets (and exceeds) an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of the
Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness
certificate requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section
333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces of legislation permit the FAA to exempt UAS's
from the airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the weight, size,
speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense
populations. Discovery's current UAS meets or exceeds each of the elements.

14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness
certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by
the FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable. However, Discovery's PIC will still
ensure that the UAS is in an airworthy condition based on compliance with the
operating documents prior to every flight.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there
are no on board pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS, this
Regulation is inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by
maintaining a safety/flight manual delineating areas where safety can be
defined9. The FAA has previously issued exemptions to this regulation in
Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A,
10602, 10700 and 32827. However, Discovery's UAS operations manual will be
kept in a location accessible by Discovery's PIC.

14 C.F.R. § 91.103 regarding preflight action. Discovery's PIC will take certain
actions before flight to ensure safety of the flight. These will include reviewing
weather, flight battery requirements9, landings, and takeoff distances and aircraft
performance data before initiation of the flight.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121 regarding altimeter settings is inapplicable insofar as
Discovery's UAS utilizes electronic GPS with a barometric sensor. According to
the manufacturer of Discovery's UAS, the GPS sensor is accurate to 2.6 feet
Vertical and 8.2 feet Horizontal. These accuracies are adequate for Discovery to
safely operate the UAS for its exempted purposes.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b) provides for the carrying of civil aircraft
certifications and registrations. They are inapplicable for the same reasons
described above. The equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining
any such required certifications and registrations by Discovery in a location
accessible by Discovery's PIC.

                                                                                       8
B. 14 C.F.R. § 45.23: Marking of The Aircraft.

         Applicable Codes of Federal Regulation require aircraft to be marked according
         to certain specifications. Discovery's UAS, by definition, is unmanned. Therefore
         the UAS does not have a cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain
         words or phrases. Further, two-inch lettering is difficult to place on such small
         aircraft with dimensions smaller that minimal lettering requirement. The FAA has
         previously issued exemptions to this regulation through Exemptions Nos. 8738,
         10167, 10167A and 10700.

C. 14 C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

         14 C.F.R. § 91.119(a) and (b) prescribes safe altitudes for the operation of civil
         aircraft. It allows helicopters to be operated at lower altitudes in certain
         conditions. Discovery's UAS will never operate at an altitude greater than 400
         AGL; safely within the standard 400 AGL as recommended by the FAA
         Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. Discovery will however operate its UAS
         in safe areas away from areas depicted in "yellow" on VFR charts, providing a
         level of safety at least equivalent to or below those in relation to minimum safe
         altitudes. Discovery will conduct all operations under Discovery's Protocols and
         Controls10, including posting a warning sign reading: "Attention Aerial
         Photography in Progress ­ Remain Back 150 Feet". Discovery will operate its
         UAS in accordance with Exemption No. 11109, which may require the UAS be
         operated closer than 500 feet to essential persons. Non-participating persons
         must remain at appropriate distances (500 feet) from the UAS, and if they need
         to be closer than 500 feet, non-participating persons will remain behind barriers
         or structures that can sufficiently protect them from the UAS debris in the event
         of an accident. Given the size, weight, maneuverability and speed of Discovery's
         UAS, an equivalent or higher level of safety will be achieved.

D. 14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections.

         The above-cited Regulations require, amongst other things, aircraft owners and
         operators to "have [the] aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part
         and shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of
         this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter.
         . . ."

These Regulations only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. They will not,
therefore, apply to Discovery's UAS. However, as a safety precaution Discovery's PIC
and VO will inspect Discovery's UAS before and after each flight.

A Summary the FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:
A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like.

14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for
procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1).
The size, weight and enclosed operational area of Discovery's UAS permits exemption
from Part 21 because Discovery's UAS meets an equivalent level of safety pursuant to
Section 333 of the Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft from the
airworthiness certificate requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and
Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces of legislation permit the FAA to exempt
UAS's from the airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the weight, size,
speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense populations.
Discovery's UAS meets or exceeds each of the elements. 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the
operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. As no such certificate will be
applicable in the form contemplated by the FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable. 14
C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no
pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is inapplicable. An
equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a manual. The FAA has
previously issued exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738,
9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, maintenance program that involves regular software
updates and curative measures for any damaged hardware. Therefore, an equivalent
level of safety will be achieved.

In summary, Discovery seeks an exemption from the following
Regulations:
14 C.F.R. 21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.7 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.9
(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. § 91.103(b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.109; 14 C.F.R. § 91.119 (a)(b); 14 C.F.R. §
91.121; 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.203(a) and (b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.405 (a);
14 C.F.R. § 91.407 (a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409 (a)(2); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409 (a ) (2); and, 14
C.F.R. §§ 91.417 (a) & (b) to commercially operate Discovery's small unmanned
vehicle/lightweight unmanned aircraft vehicle in community awareness, real estate
operations, filmmaking, golf course mapping, agricultural mapping, and photogrammetry
for various industries and to develop economic platforms for real estate and golf
courses.

Currently, area awareness, filmmaking, real estate aerial videography/photography, golf
course mapping, agricultural mapping, and photogrammetry for various industries relies
primarily on the use of larger aircraft running on combustible fuel, posing potential risk to
the public. Granting Discovery's request for exemption will reduce current risk levels and
thereby enhance safety. Discovery's UAS craft does not contain potentially explosive
fuel, is smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than conventional real estate video and
photographic aircraft with much less flight time. Further, Discovery will operate at lower
altitudes and in controlled airspace eliminating potential public risk flying to and from
established air fields. Discovery has been informally analyzing flight information and will
compile safety protocols and the implementation of a flight operations manual for real
estate usage that exceeds currently accepted means and methods for safe flight. Formal
collection of information shared with the FAA will enhance the FAA's internal efforts to
establish protocols for complying with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012.

                                                                                                         10
There are no personnel on board Discovery's UAS and therefore the likelihood of death
or serious bodily injury is significantly diminished. Discovery's operation of its UAS,
weighing less than 5 pounds and travelling at lower speeds within limited areas will
provide an equivalent level of safety as that achieved under current FARs. Accordingly,
Discovery respectfully request that the FAA grant Discovery's exemption request and
Discovery is willing to cooperate in sharing information to benefit the FAA, safety of
manned aircraft, and the general public at large.

Appendix B

Discovery Management Group's UAS Flight Protocols and Safety
Controls

Public safety both on the ground as well as manned aircraft in flight, is an essential part
of Discovery's safety concerns during all aerial commercial work. As such, safety
protocols and controls must be implement for every flight; through pre-flight preparation
and through the duration of the flight.

PreFlight Planning Protocols:

     Inspect flight area for:
              o Vicinity of public safety helipads/heliports
              o Vicinity of medical helipads/heliports

     Check weather forecasts for wind advisory, low cloud ceiling, fog, or other
         weather conditions that my impact flight.

     Consult Sky Vector aeronautical Charts (Skyvector.com) for airport vicinity and
         flight paths of possible air traffic.
              o Contact respective airport to advise of estimated flight time, estimated
                   flight duration, estimated elevation of flight, and any other pertinent
                   information.

Pre-Flight Protocol:

     Check batteries with voltage meter to insure fully charged and ready for use,
         including inspection of batteries for damage or leakage that may affect proper
         operation.

     Inspect propellers for cracks, chips or damage that may cause sudden loss of
         propulsion or unmanageable/uncontrolled flight.

     Check all GPS and Telemetry connections prior to flight.
     Inspect the Ground Control Station (radio controller) for proper operation and

         appropriate battery life.
     Inspect flight area for:

              o Vicinity of light poles, utility wires, and trees,
              o Flocks of birds that may cause interference and potential flight impact,
              o Vicinity of any elevated obstructions that may pose potential flight hazard,
              o Vicinity of roadways with moderate to heavy traffic that can be distracted,
              o Public gatherings that may attract viewers,
              o Optional point of control for best visual site of UAS while in flight,
     Emergency landing areas Takeoff and landing:
              o Inspect area for best and safest point of takeoff and landing,

                                                                                                         14
              o If in a residential or commercial subdivision or area that is within 150 feet
                   of a residential street, post warning sign(s) with the follow text; "Attention
                   Aerial Photography in Progress ­ Remain Back 150 feet"

Flight Protocol:

     Takeoff and land from same location (have alternate landing areas in case of
         emergencies), remain alert to birds, sound or aircraft, curious public, and
         approaching vehicles.

     The visual observer will not allow anyone to engage in conversation or distract
         the remote control pilot.

     Restrict flight to minimal elevation sufficient to acquire desired resultsremained
         prepared for emergency landing at all timespay attention to flight time ­ warning
         meter for low voltage.

Set voltage meter alarm for low voltage and flight timer as a safety alertland UAS and
shut down propulsion immediately following landing ­ priority of disconnecting batteries

Post flight:

    1. Disconnect battery to prevent accidental activation of propulsion system.
    2. Secure UAS in a safe location.
    3. Remove all warning signs from public access areas.

Safety Protocol:

In the event of a problem or emergency, the UAS will immediately be landed at the
safest and closet ground location. An event includes;

     Manned aircraft heard or seen in vicinity of Discovery's flight.
     There is a public gathering within established safety boundary wanting to

         observe flight.
     Pilot is being distracted from focusing on flight and safety.
     Sudden change in weather (i.e., wind bursts, fog encroachment, rain).
     Sudden increase in vehicular traffic in vicinity of flight.
     Birds enter into proximity of flight.

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote control and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control system

connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more

information.

1.2 Connections with Other DJI Products

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G Wi-Fi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
          updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
          while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote control's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range

during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Control Operation

  The operations of remote control are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote control are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote control is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

Control    nose direction
(Mode 2)                                  The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                                          Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                          Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                          The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                                          altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                          Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                          position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                                          suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                          prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                          elevation changes.

                                                      The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                                      clock-wise.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      forward.
                                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                                      stick is centered.
                                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                                      faster flight velocity.
                                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                                      centered.
                                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in
                                                      a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight
                                                      velocity.

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

                                                         Flip once

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote control and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

A                                         BC          D

                                          Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote control.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Control Operation> for

      more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 |
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
          4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote control is lost. The flight control system
will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote control and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote control is powered off.
2 The remote control is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must have

        been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote control.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the aircraft, essentially reducing

        the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures

1 Record Home Point.                       2 Flying.                                         3 Remote controller signal lost.

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
        will descend automatically.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
control from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position as
a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks on
the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:
1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is

        recorded last time.
2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

                      distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote control's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,
                      make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.

     the FPV HUB.
3) Please refer to Collocation1 to connect the wireless video

     transmission module.

Notes
(1) If using the FPV HUB, the original 4-Pin cable and video cable on

     PHANTOM 2 will be spared, please remove and clear them out.
     Make sure the video cable is totally cleared without any copper wire
     left to prevent short circuit damage.
(2) All the connection operations should be conducted when the
     intelligent battery is powered off.
(3) Check whether pins of the connectors on the FPV HUB are straight
     and in good condition before connecting. Please and plug and
     unplug the connector carefully to avoid damage or short circuit.
(4) It's not recommended to install the FPV HUB and extended devices
     inside the PHANTOM 2 aircraft.
(5) Make sure to install the AVL58 away from the compass to avoid
     interference.
(6) FPV HUB is non water-proof, if it is wet, please wash it with alcoholic
     cleanser and dry it before use. Otherwise components may be
     damaged cause of electrochemical corrosion.
(7) Do not leak any metal, conductive objects into the connector pins of
     FPV HUB to prevent short circuit damage.
(8) It's not recommended to use cables not in the kit to connect devices

©2013 DJI Innovations. All Rights Reserved.4 |
     to avoid unexpected damage.
(9) Make sure the connection is correct when using wireless video

     transmission module unspecified by DJI.
Tips
(1) FPV HUB has a resettable fuse for over circuit precaution. The fuse

     will automatically open to prevent damage if the working current of
     power consuming devices (except DJI Zenmuse series) goes over 2A
     or if VCC and GND short circuited. After the short circuit trouble
     issued or the over current load is removed, turn off the power of the
     intelligent battery, the fuse will recover after 10secs.
(2) A component will be damaged if PHANTOM 2 has been short circuit
     once. In this condition, users still can use the FPV HUB and make the
     PHANTOM 2 work well again, ignoring the damaged component.
