                                                      Exemption No. 11490A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0307

Ms. Carol Goasin
Counsel for The Travelers Companies, Inc.
Steptoe & Johnson LLP
1330 Connecticut Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20036

Dear Ms. Goasin:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letters dated June 15 and July 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or
operator) for an amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and
(c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add the DJI Phantom 3 and 3D Robotics Solo.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11490
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11490 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the 3DRobotics IRIS+,
    DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 3, and 3D Robotics Solo when weighing less than
    55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a
    new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

Re: The Travelers Companies, Inc. Request to Amend
         Exemption No. 11490, Docket No. FAA-2015-0307
         Exemption No. 11494, Docket No. FAA-2015-0304

Dear Sir or Madam:

         On May 5, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") granted to The Travelers
Companies, Inc. ("Travelers") Exemption Nos. 11490 and 11494 (the "Exemptions") in Docket
Nos. FAA-2015-0307 and FAA-2015-0304, respectively. The Exemptions allow Travelers to
operate certain small unmanned aircraft systems ("UAS") to perform aerial data collection.
Travelers hereby respectfully requests an amendment to each of the Exemptions to allow
Travelers to operate an additional type of small UAS under the same conditions and limitations
set forth in the Exemptions.

         In addition to the two types of small UAS already authorized by the Exemptions (i.e., DJI
Phantom 2 and 3D Robotics IRIS+ aircraft), Travelers wishes to amend the Exemptions to also
allow Travelers to operate the 3D Robotics Solo aircraft. The 3DR Solo is a small (micro) UAS;
it weighs 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg.) without payload and 3.9 pounds (1.8 kg.) with payload (camera
and gimbal). It is 10 inches tall and 18 inches wide. Its maximum speed is 55 miles per hour,
well within the prescribed limitation of 100 miles per hour. Its range is roughly 0.5 miles, and its
maximum flight time is about 20 minutes. Like the small UAS that Travelers is already
permitted to operate, the 3DR Solo has geo-fencing and flight programming capabilities and a
flight termination system. If the UAS loses communications or its GPS signal, it will return to a
pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered in
accordance with Travelers' Unmanned Aircraft System Operating Procedures, Safety Code and
Training Syllabus ("Manual").
 
 

 

         Travelers' Manual is already on file with FAA; it was submitted confidentially with
Travelers' original petitions in the above-referenced dockets. The manufacturer's user manual
and preflight checklist for the 3DR Solo are available at: http://3drobotics.com/wp-
content/uploads/2015/06/DraftB.pdf. Travelers will operate the 3DR Solo in accordance with its
Manual (as revised from time to time) and the manufacturer's manual and checklist.

         Travelers respectfully submits that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of this
request in the Federal Register and for granting the requested amendments expeditiously.
Travelers asks only to amend its existing Exemptions to add another type of small UAS. Its
request would not set any precedent, and any delay in acting on the request would harm
Travelers, which intends to begin conducting operations using the 3DR Solo as soon as possible
after the requested amendments are approved.

         Please do not hesitate to contact Travelers' outside counsel, Carol Gosain, with any
questions about this filing.

Sincerely,

                  Exemption No. 11490, Docket No. FAA-2015-0307
                  Exemption No. 11494, Docket No. FAA-2015-0304

Dear Sir or Madam:

         On May 5, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") granted to The Travelers
Companies, Inc. ("Travelers") Exemption Nos. 11490 and 11494 (the "Exemptions") in Docket
Nos. FAA-2015-0307 and FAA-2015-0304 (the "Exemptions Dockets"), respectively. The
Exemptions allow Travelers to operate certain small unmanned aircraft systems ("UAS") to
perform aerial data collection. Travelers hereby respectfully requests an amendment to each of
the Exemptions to allow Travelers to operate additional types of small UAS under the same
conditions and limitations set forth in the Exemptions.

         Travelers wishes to amend the Exemptions to allow Travelers to operate the DJI Phantom
3 Professional and DJI Phantom 3 Advanced (together, "DJI Phantom 3"), as well as any other
types of "micro" unmanned aircraft, as that term is defined in the Small UAS Proposed Rule, i.e.,
UAS that weigh no more than 4.4 pounds.1 The DJI Phantom 3 weighs about 2.8 pounds. Its

         1 Travelers is already authorized by the Exemptions to operate two types of small UAS ­
i.e., the DJI Phantom 2 and 3D Robotics IRIS+ aircraft ­ and it has a pending request in the
Exemptions Dockets for authority to operate the 3D Robotics Solo aircraft, also a small UAS.
The size, weight and performance specifications of the DJI Phantom 3 are substantially similar to
those of the DJI Phantom 2. Each of the DJI Phantom 2, 3D Robotics IRIS+, 3D Robotics Solo
and DJI Phantom 3 weighs less than 4.4 pounds and thus would be considered "micro" under
FAA's proposed micro classification in the Small UAS Proposed Rule. See Operation and
Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 80 Fed. Reg. 9544 (Feb. 23, 2015). Travelers
requests herein not only authority to operate the DJI Phantom 3, but also authority to operate any
other types of small UAS that would be classified as micro under the proposed rule.
diagonal size (including propellers) is about 23 inches. Its maximum speed is 38 miles per hour,
well within the prescribed limitation of 100 miles per hour. Its maximum range is roughly 1.2
miles, and its maximum flight time is about 23 minutes. Like the UAS that Travelers is already
permitted to operate, the DJI Phantom 3 has geo-fencing and flight programming capabilities and
a flight termination system. If the UAS loses communications or its GPS signal, it will return to
a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered in
accordance with the Travelers' Unmanned Aircraft System Operating Procedures, Safety Code
and Training Syllabus ("Manual").

         Travelers' Manual is already on file with FAA; it was submitted confidentially with
Travelers' original petitions in the Exemptions Dockets. The manufacturer's user manuals,
quick start manuals and safety guidelines for the DJI Phantom 3 are available at:
http://www.dji.com/product/phantom-3/download. Travelers will operate the DJI Phantom 3 and
all other small UAS that it is authorized to operate in accordance with its Manual (as revised
from time to time) and the manufacturers' manuals.

         Travelers respectfully submits that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of this
request in the Federal Register and for granting the requested amendments expeditiously.
Travelers asks only to amend its existing Exemptions to add other types of micro UAS, i.e., the
DJI Phantom 3 and other "micro" unmanned aircraft, as that term is defined in the Small UAS
Proposed Rule. Its request would not set any precedent, and any delay in acting on the request
would harm Travelers, which intends to conduct operations using new types of micro UAS as
soon as possible after the requested amendments are approved.

         Please do not hesitate to contact Travelers' outside counsel, Carol Gosain, with any
questions about this filing.
