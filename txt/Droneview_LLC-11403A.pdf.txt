                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0148

Mr. Steven J. Combs

Elmendorf, TX 78112

Dear Mr.Combs:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 13, 2015 you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Droveview, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your
current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment to
add the, DJI Phantom 3 Professional.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
                                                                                                 2

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing

requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11403
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11403 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Phantom 2 Vision+
    and DJI Phantom 3 Professional when weighing less than 55 pounds including
    payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
    petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

Re: Request for modification of Exemption No.11403, Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0148.

Dear Sir or Madam,

Droneview LLC requests a modification of the above exemption number in the respect of adding
an additional UAV to the business.

The UAV is the DJI Phantom 3 Professional which in all practical aspects of the flight
characteristics is the same as the Phantom 2 Vision + in which Droneview was granted its
exemption.
The differences from the Phantom 2 Vision + and the Phantom 3 professional is mainly the
camera system and the camera system software. All of the previous safety standards and
features from the Phantom 2 Vision + are incorporated into the Phantom 3 Professional as well
as some easier to use and more intuitive remote control functions.

Droneview LLC will incorporate the Phantom 3 Professional into its business using the same
pilot training and rigorous inspection procedures outlined in the original documents submitted
under the Regulatory Docket FAA-2015-0148 with separate and serial number specific
checklists and maintenance records.

The operator's manual for the DJI Phantom 3 Professional as well as the quick start manual are
available online at http://www.dji.com/product/phantom-3/download.
The file size is 13.2 Mb and will not upload to the Regulations.gov website as it's too large.

If you have any questions please contact me at the information above.

Sincerely,

Steven J. Combs
