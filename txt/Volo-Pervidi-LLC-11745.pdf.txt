                                                           Exemption No. 11745
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0880

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Counsel for Volo Pervidi, LLC
Antonelli Law
100 North LaSalle Street
Suite 2400
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 30, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Volo Pervidi, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct geospatial
analysis.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the senseFly eBee and DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21 and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Volo Pervidi, LLCis granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Volo Pervidi, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the senseFly eBee and
    DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
    Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
    amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform
Act of 2012 and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of
14 C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform

Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of Volo
Pervidi, LLC ("Volo Pervidi"), an operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft ("UA") Systems
("UAS") used to conduct geospatial analysis. Specifically, applicant seeks an exemption from
the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed in Appendices A and B to allow commercial

operation of its UAs, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions

outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA in a grant of this petition.

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the senseFly
eBee and the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ for geospatial analysis in Class G airspace nationwide, or
as otherwise prescribed in an Air Traffic Organization ("ATO") issued COA. The UA operations
contemplated by this petition are in the public interest because they clearly satisfy the "Four D's"
of exemplary uses of unmanned aircraft: to replace work that is dangerous, difficult, dull, or
dirty, and at the same time provide an equivalent or greater level of safety than alternative
manned aircraft operations. The UA covered by this petition are small battery-powered craft,
with the eBee weighing approximately 1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload, and
the Phantom weighing approximately 2.7 lbs. (1.2kg), inclusive of battery and payload.
Operation of the UAs under the strict conditions proposed below will provide an equivalent level
of safety, as Congress intended, while still allowing commercial operations. Operations using
these UAs are far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing
aircraft that weigh thousands of pounds, carry highly flammable fuel, and operate in close
proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure, and people.

         Congress directed the FAA to consider seven factors in deciding whether to approve
Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to
airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight. In this case, each
factor supports the exemption request. In particular, the UAs are small, and will operate at slow

and (a)(2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to operate commercially a small unmanned
aircraft system (UA) (2.7 lbs. or less).

    Approval of the exemption requested by petitioner will allow commercial operation of the
    senseFly eBee and DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ for aerial geospatial analysis in Class G
    airspace nationwide, or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO issued COA. The requested
    exemption should be granted because operation of small UAs, weighing approximately
    1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.), and 2.7 lbs. (1.2 kg), respectively, inclusive of battery and payload,
    conducted in the strict conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety,
    while still allowing commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the
    exemption are far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-
    wing aircraft weighing thousands of pounds and carrying highly flammable fuel, and
    operating in close proximity to the ground and people. The seven factors Congress directed
    the FAA to consider when approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed,
    operational capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation
    within visual line of sight ­ each support the request. In particular, the aircraft are small,
    and will operate at slow speeds, and close to the ground in order to more safely and
    efficiently conduct inspections that would otherwise involve a risk of death to the
    inspectors. The substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life, coupled
    with the low risk use of UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in favor of
    granting the exemption.

and 11191.

B. The Crew

         The crew will consist of a pilot in command (PIC) and a visual observer (VO).

         The PIC and VO will have been trained in operation of UAs generally and received up-
to-date information on the UAs to be operated pursuant to this grant. The PIC will have
completed, at a minimum:

     For PICs of the eBee:
             o 10 hours of simulator training on RealFlight RC Flight Simulator, utilizing a
                  fixed-wing aircraft; and
             o The senseFly eBee training documentation, submitted as Exhibit 3.

     For PICs of the Vision+:
             o 10 hours of simulator training on RealFlight RC Flight Simulator, utilizing a
                  quadcopter; and
             o The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ training program, submitted as Exhibit 8.

The PIC will be required to participate in annual training thereafter.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the training and
characteristics of the crew are numbers 3 and 6-9 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

C. Flight Conditions

         The UA will be used to conduct geospatial analysis nationwide. Unless a written
agreement is in place with local Air Traffic Control permitting use in other classes of airspace, it
will only be flown in Class G airspace, under 400 feet above ground level ("AGL"), and under
controlled conditions over property that is restricted as stated in petitioner's Safety Plan.
Petitioner will work with the local FSDO when planning operations. Petitioner will only operate
its UA in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The UA will at all times be no less than 500
feet below and no less than 2,000 feet horizontally from a cloud, and petitioner will not conduct
operations unless visibility is at least 3 statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always

                                                          7
make a safety assessment of the risk of every operation, and will only operate when it is
determined that no hazards are present.

         Please refer to the following documents for more information about flight conditions:
         Exhibit 1:

                  Section 1: Site Selection
                  Section 3: Pre Flight Site and Airframe Inspection
         Exhibit 8:
                  Section 1: Aerial and Ground Preflight Inspection

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the flight conditions in
which the UA will be operated are numbers 2, 4, 16, and 28-29 in Section V below. Each has
been adopted or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption
petitions.

D. Flight Operations

         The purpose of every UA flight will be to safely, accurately, and efficiently conduct
geospatial analysis of undeveloped property and public rights of way. The UA will conduct
aerial surveys using RGB, NIR, infrared, and multispectral cameras, as well as LiDAR sensors.
Once collected, this data will be used to conduct drainage studies, engineering grading analysis,
and for resource management.

         Every UA flight will use at minimum a two person flight crew: a PIC and a VO. The
standard operational procedures that they will follow are set out in the operating documents,
specifically Exhibits 1 and 8. Please refer to the following sections for information pertaining to
operations:

         Exhibit 1:
                  Section 2: Mission Planning
                  Section 3: Pre Flight Site and Airframe Inspection

         Exhibit 8:
                  Section 2: Aircraft Physical Inspection ­ Preflight
                  Section 3: Preflight Checklist
                  Section 4: Post-flight Checks
                  Section 5: In Case of Emergency

         Although the majority of flights will be over undeveloped property and away from areas
accessible to the public, certain flights will be over public roads that could bring the UA within
500 feet of nonparticipating individuals. If this is the case, the flight crew will procure a
temporary barricading permit that will safely prohibit vehicular and pedestrian access to the
affected area for the duration of the operation. During road operations, men and women will
work as flaggers to control the flow of traffic in both directions. This temporary restriction in
traffic flow while the UA is directly overhead would prevent nonparticipating individuals from
entering the area. However, should a nonparticipating individual or vehicle enter into the flight
area, the operation will cease immediately and the PIC will land the UA, keeping the safety of
the nonparticipating individual or vehicle as the priority.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 11-12, 17-25, and 32-35 in Section V below. Each has been accepted or imposed by the

                                                          8
 FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

 IV. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

          Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
 operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at
 least an equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory
 structure. Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to
 be bound when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A
 contains a matrix connecting (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for
 which it provides an equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333
 exemption grants in which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety.

       Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national
 security issue. The PIC is willing to undergo a background check, including the proposed
 Transportation Security Administration vetting process, to ensure that no national security threat
 is present. Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg. 9543 at 9572
 (proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14 C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45, et al.)).

 V. Proposed Conditions of the Exemption

1. The eBee will weigh approximately 1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.). The Vision+ will weigh
    approximately 2.7 lbs. (1.2 kg.).

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of geospatial analysis.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and visual observer.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in feet
    AGL.

5. The eBee will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 49 knots. The Vision+ will not
    be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 43 knots.

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the pilot in command (PIC) and a
    visual observer (VO).

7. The PIC will have, at minimum, 25 hours of training on the UA to be operated under this
    grant before accepting commercial operations.

8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification criteria
    and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with how the UA
    will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR §
    61.51(b). A record of the PIC and VO training will be documented and made available upon
    request by the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during dedicated
                                                           9
    training sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not
    essential for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the
    UA with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance has
    been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance and
    alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in
    accordance with the UA manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements set forth in the operating documents.
    Maintenance, inspection, alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts will
    be noted in the aircraft records, including total time in service, description of work
    accomplished, and the signature of the authorized person returning the UA to service. The
    authorized person will make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken
    against discrepancies discovered between inspections.

15. Each UA operated under the exemption will comply with all manufacturer Safety Bulletins.

16. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will not
    be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight operations.

17. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions)
    there is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and
    prepare to land the UA with 25% battery power remaining.

18. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 25% battery
    reserve.

19. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

20. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will
    return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered
    in accordance with the operating documents

21. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

22. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow the
    procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating
    documents, it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request.
    If the petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the
    FAA granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant of
    exemption.

23. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents of
    the landowners over which flights will be conducted.

24. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or city
    jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

25. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

26. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM
    as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport management will
    be made available to the Administrator upon request.

27. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally
    from, a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

28. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, altitude level
    and potential transponder requirements.
                                                          11
29. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

30. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

31. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

32. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

33. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

34. The UA will not be operated over congested or densely populated areas.

35. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating persons,
    vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

     a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from
          the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
          nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
          nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
          will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

     b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
          such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
          assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

     c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
          undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

36. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's UA
    Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the National
    Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site:
    www.ntsb.gov.

 VI. Privacy

          There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
 flights will occur over undeveloped property or public rights of way. When the UA is being
 flown, the onboard cameras and sensors will be focused on the ground beneath the UA, and thus
 turned so as to be facing away from any occupied structures that may be in the area to minimize
 inadvertent video or still images of uninvolved persons.

                                                          12
         All data collected will be stored on a private hard drive. Should data be stored in any
online medium, it will be password protected and not made available for public use. No
nonparticipating individuals will be identified unless they are trespassing or interfering with
petitioner's operations. Should the information collected be made public, any nonparticipating
individuals or vehicles will be blurred or blacked-out. No attempt will be made to identify any
individuals filmed during the flights except in cases where they are trespassing upon or
damaging property, or interfering with petitioner's or its customers' operations.

VII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety for aerial geospatial analysis projects.
The enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact achieved using a UA with the
specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a
manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel,
gives the FAA good cause to find that the UA operation enabled by this exemption is in the
public interest.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of applicant's UA, pursuant to
Volo Pervidi's operating procedures.

         Traditional methods for geospatial analysis lead to a number of risks for engineers
because they require engineers to traverse large geographic areas while carrying heavy
equipment necessary for surveys. This equipment makes it difficult to navigate across rugged
terrain. Engineers risk encounters with wildlife, including poisonous snakes. Engineers are also
subject to prolonged exposure to the elements, especially in the height of summer and winter. At
higher elevations, the dangers associated with extended exposure to cold temperatures are
compounded.

         Traditional methods also take engineers into active mining sites, containing multi-ton
machines that could cause risk of life or injury to engineers. The presence of these engineers
often leads to significant disruption of the mining site, which causes productivity and financial
loss.

         Additionally, there are geographic areas that are culturally, archaeologically, and
environmentally sensitive that would otherwise be inaccessible. Many Native American Tribes
do not allow non-tribe members to enter certain areas of their land due to their cultural and
religious beliefs. Traditional survey methods can damage sensitive archaeological and
environmental areas that need to be mapped, but using a manned aircraft would otherwise be cost
prohibitive.

         Use of a UA will ameliorate many of the hazards associated with traditional methods.
Individuals involved with operations will be responsible for carrying less, and lighter,
equipment, over shorter distances. There will be less risk of engineers running into wildlife,
including stepping into dens of snakes. Individuals will be exposed to the elements for shorter
periods of time because operations will be resolved more quickly. This will significantly
decrease time spent in 100ºF or more temperatures during summer months and in 0°F or less

                                                         13
temperatures during winter. UA flights over culturally, archaeologically, and environmentally
sensitive areas will allow these areas to be mapped without damaging those areas.

         Finally, when projects are over public roads, use of the UA will reduce the number of
individuals who may otherwise be in danger from careless motorists. Additionally, these
analytical projects may be conducted more quickly, reducing the amount of time workers need to
be in the road and the amount of time that traffic will be blocked.

B. Appendix B: Volo Pervidi's argument for exemption from 14 C.F.R. §61.113:
         Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.

         Volo Pervidi requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §61.113 so that the PIC of the UA
will not be required to possess a private or commercial pilot's license. As the FAA and numerous
other national airspace regulators have recognized, UA operations conducted by persons who do
not hold a pilot's license can still achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by
manned aircraft with pilots holding a private or commercial pilot's license.

         Although it recognizes that a pilot's license is unnecessary for safe UA operation, the
FAA has to date declined to allow grant exemptions under Section 333 that would permit
individuals who possess neither a private nor a commercial pilot's certificate to conduct
commercial UA operations. It has specified two reasons for declining to do so. First, it has stated
that it does not possess the authority under Section 333 to exempt individuals from the
requirement under 49 U.S.C. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman to
serve in the capacity for which the certificate was issued. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. Second,
the FAA has concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) security screening
required of all certified airmen meets the statutory requirement in Section 333 that operations not
pose a threat to national security. Exemption No. 11110 at 15.

         Volo Pervidi respectfully requests that the FAA reconsider its position. There is no
dispute that it is unnecessary for an operator of a UA to go through the rigorous process of
becoming a certified pilot in order to safely operate a UA. In addition, the FAA does have the
authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement in 49 U.S.C. §44711to hold an airman
certificate for "serv[ing] in the capacity for which the certificate was issued." Indeed, it has
exercised that authority repeatedly in the Section 333 process. Finally, the FAA's security
concerns can be addressed by a variety of methods involving operator background checks to be
conducted by government agencies.

         1. The FAA and foreign regulators recognize that obtaining a manned aircraft
             pilot license is unnecessary for safe operation of a UA

         The FAA, like the other national airspace regulators that have considered the issue, has
concluded that UA operations conducted by persons who do not hold a pilot's license can still
achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned aircraft with pilots
holding a private or commercial pilot's license. In its recent UAS NPRM, the FAA stated:

         "While these airman certification requirements are necessary for manned aircraft
         operations, they impose an unnecessary burden for many small UAS operations.
         This is because a person typically obtains a private or commercial pilot certificate
         by learning how to operate a manned aircraft. Much of that knowledge would not
         be applicable to small UAS operations because a small UAS is operated
         differently than manned aircraft. In addition, the knowledge currently necessary to
         obtain a private or commercial pilot certificate would not equip the certificate
         holder with the tools necessary to safely operate a small UAS... Thus, requiring
         persons wishing to operate a small UAS to obtain a private or commercial pilot
         certificate imposes the cost of certification on those persons, but does not result in
         a significant safety benefit because the process of obtaining the certificate does
         not equip those persons with the tools necessary to mitigate the public risk posed

         by small UAS operations." Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned
         Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg. 9543 at 9550 (proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14
         C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45, et al.).

         The FAA's conclusion that manned aircraft flying experience is unnecessary for the
operation of a UA is supported by research by the FAA and the Army Research Laboratory.
They demonstrate that UAs, even those much larger than the UAs proposed by Volo Pervidi, can
be safely flown by non-certificated pilots with a small amount of training. For example, one
Army Research Laboratory study concluded:

         "[T]he specific motor skills needed to control the radio-controlled UAV would
         have to be learned by aviators independently of the motor skills learned in flying
         an aircraft. In particular, the somatic and visual cues that pilots use during aircraft
         landings would not be useful (and perhaps even counter-productive) for the
         different skill sets and perceptual viewpoint necessary for radio-controlled
         landings."1

         Additional research reports lend further support for the exclusion requested. For
example, a report sponsored by the FAA concluded that "We know that certain systems, like the
U.S. Army Hunter and Shadow systems, are successfully flown by pilots with no manned aircraft
experience."2

         In addition, foreign government airspace regulators that have examined the issue have
consistently recognized that the skills required to fly a manned aircraft are irrelevant to operating
a UA. For that reason, they have concluded that UA operators do not need to have a private or
commercial pilot's license. Canada, for example, does not require a pilot's license to operate a
UA. Transport Canada requires training of UA operators, but that training is limited to pilot
ground school and flight operation training on UAs, not manned aircraft.3 Moreover, Canada
allows this training to be "provided by other pilots, manufacturers, [UA] flight training
organizations or . . . self taught." 4

populated areas may change this assessment, indicating further research was needed to address
this concern, this concern is inapplicable as Volo Pervidi's flights will not be in congested areas.

         Similarly, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recognized that
determining "Remote Pilot qualification requirements on the same basis as manned aircraft may
yield requirements that are too inflexible, too onerous and inappropriate for UAS operations."5
As a result, the CAA only requires UA operators to demonstrate UA operator competence.6
While there are a variety of ways to demonstrate competence, the most common is to complete a
course that will lead to a ground exam and flight test. Australia, too, requires only passage of a
UA-specific ground school program in lieu of a private pilot license.7 Finally, more than a dozen
countries, including Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, have adopted the
National UAS Certificate for Small Unmanned Aircraft (BNUC-S) Standard for UA pilot
certification.8 This standard results in a type-specific UA certificate and does not require the
operator to have a pilot's license. The process involves taking a short ground school course,
passing a ground school test and then passing a practical test on commercial operation of the
specific UAS per the UAS manufacturer's operations manual.

         All of this experience and evidence indicates that the proposed exemption will provide a
greater level of safety than operations under 14 C.F.R. §61.113. In this instance, the PIC will
have gone through training as described above in Section III B. This training and education is
focused on UAs generally, and in particular on the aircraft to be operated, rather than taking
additional time and risk to train on a manned aircraft, weighing several thousand pounds and
carrying highly flammable fuel.

         The FAA has concluded in the NPRM that such UA-specific training is more than
sufficient to provide an equivalent level of safety for UA operations. Sometime in the next 18-
24 months, that position will be enshrined in a valid regulation. However, in the meantime, the
FAA claims it lacks the authority to relax the requirement to possess a pilot certificate. As we
show in the next section, that position is both incorrect and contradicted by the FAA's recent
decisions.

         2. The FAA has and has already exercised the authority to exempt applicants from
             the airman certificate requirement

         The FAA claims that it lacks authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement of
49 U.S. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This claim is
inconsistent with both (i) the statutory language of that section and Section 333, and (ii)
numerous recent FAA decisions.

         The operative part of 49 USC §44711 provides that a "person may not . . . serve in any
capacity as an airman with respect to a civil aircraft, . . . used, or intended for use, in air
commerce -- (A) without an airman certificate authorizing the airman to serve in the capacity

for which the certificate was issued . . . " If the FAA's interpretation were correct, this language
would require that any person wishing to operate a UA for commercial operations have an
airman certificate authorizing the person to serve as an airman in commercial operations.

         However, in all of its recent grants of Section 333 petitions, the FAA has ­ without
explicitly acknowledging the fact - exempted commercial UA operators from the § 44711(A)
requirement that they hold an airman certificate authorizing them "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." It has done so by allowing them to operate UA so long as they
hold a private pilot's or sport pilot's authorization, even though such a certificate does not permit
commercial operations. Exemption No. 11062 at 15-18; Exemption No. 11110 at 14-16;
Exemption No. 11191 at 3-5; and Exemption No. 11229 at 3 and 8.

         The FAA argues that it cannot exempt applicants from the requirements of §44711
because, while the specific language of Section 333 grants it limited statutory flexibility relative
to 49 U.S.C. §44704 for the purposes of airworthiness certification, Section 333 does not provide
flexibility relative to §44711 and other sections of Title 49. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This
argument ignores the plain language of Section 333. The relevant language of Section 333 is:

         (a) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subtitle, and
         not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
         Transportation shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate
         safely in the national airspace system before completion of the plan and
         rulemaking required by section 332 of this Act or the guidance required by
         section 334 of this Act.

         (b) ASSESSMENT OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.--In making the
         determination under subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine, at a
         minimum--

         (1) which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size,
         weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas,
         and operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the
         national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security; and

         (2) whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
         certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for
         the operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1).

         (c) REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE OPERATION.--If the Secretary determines
         under this section that certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in
         the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the
         safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system.

         The language of Section 333(b) is permissive: it requires that the Secretary "determine, at
a minimum . . . whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the operation of
unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1)." Nothing in (b) precludes the
Secretary from determining whether or not a pilot's license is required for operation of a UA
identified under paragraph (b)(1).

                                                         21
         Indeed, the FAA has implicitly conceded the point by granting exemptions from the
requirement that commercial UA operators hold a commercial pilot certificate. From an
analytical standpoint, there is no difference between granting an exemption from the commercial
pilot's license requirement and granting an exemption from the private or sport pilot's license
requirement. Both are clearly exemptions from a specific statutory requirement in 49 U.S.C.
§44711. If the FAA has the statutory authority under Section 333(b) to do the former, it has the
same authority to do the latter.9

         For all of the reasons set forth above, the FAA should reconsider its position and exercise
its full authority to grant an exemption from all the requirements of 49 USC §44711, so that a
person serving as a commercial UAS operator need not have a pilot's license.

9 The FAA has not specifically identified the statutory provision that underpins its authority to
grant the exemptions from the commercial pilot's license requirement. Whether the statutory
basis is Section 333 or some other provision makes no difference. If there is a basis for a partial
exemption from in 49 U.S.C. § 44711, that basis also justifies an exemption from the entire
provision.

eMotion
Fsolifgtwhta prelanning & control

eMotion is senseFly's intuitive ground station software, supplied with
every senseFly drone. Use it to plan, simulate, monitor and control
your mapping flight.

             01. Plan                                                        30                                                      1/4

           (or create a more complex polygon) over the area you want to
           map. Then define your required ground resolution and image
           overlap. eMotion will automatically generate a full flight plan,
           calculating the eBee's required altitude and displaying its
           projected trajectory.

           Flying over uneven terrain? Use eMotion's 3D mission
           planning feature to consider elevation data when setting the
           altitude of mission waypoints and the resulting flight lines -
           improving ground resolution and increasing mission safety.
           You can even check your flight plan in Google Earth, using
           eMotion's built-in interface.

           02. Simulate

           eMotion's Simulator mode will help you plan your flight and
           explore the advanced functions of your senseFly drone.

           Simulating your flight helps you understand the position and
           size of images that will be taken. It also allows you to learn
           more about advanced functions, such as in-flight waypoint
           editing and camera control, without putting your drone at
           risk.

           Enter the wind strength and direction, then press Play to
           'launch' your drone. You can view all aspects of your flight as
           the drone flies its mission. You can also use eMotion's Google
           Earth interface to follow your flight in 3D. Then, if necessary,
           just update your flight plan and save it for future use.

           03. Monitor

           Once you have launched your drone, eMotion displays all its
           flight parameters, battery level and image acquisition progress
           in real time.

           The main Map Area displays the drone's current position,
           updated live as it executes its flight. A small arrow and info
           box show the wind speed and direction, as measured by the
           drone, while the Status Panel that follows the moving drone
           icon displays its current waypoint status, battery charge,
           flight time and altitude. All of these data and more are also
           shown in the Flight Monitoring tab of the sidebar on the right.

           In the event of a problem, such as extreme winds or low
           battery, a warning message instantly appears.

           04. Control

           Made a mistake with your flight planning? With eMotion you
           can reconfigure your drone's flight plan and landing point
           while in flight. For example, just drag and drop to move the
           landing location and angle of approach.

           The Control Bar at the top of the screen provides further
           options, such as putting your drone in a Hold position,
           returning to land, or aborting a landing (should a car stop at
           or near the landing point for example). Otherwise, your drone
           will automatically land at its designated landing point when
           its mission is over.

           After your drone lands, just import your data into eMotion,
           choose to perform local processing in Postflight Terra 3D, and
           click to create a quick quality report.

           This report even includes a low-resolution orthomosaic
           preview - helping you gain immediate feedback on the quality
           of the images acquired during your mission.

           02. Generate orthomosaics, 3D
           m  odels & point clouds

           Postflight Terra 3D's workflow is fully automated. After initial
           processing, handled with just one click, use Postflight Terra 3
           to easily generate 2D orthomosaics, 3D digital elevation
           models (DEMs) and 3D point clouds from your eBee's images.

           The software handles all the necessary calibration and
           processing to give you survey-grade accurate outputs.
           However, you retain full control if required, meaning for
           example you can assess and edit all tie points (GCPs, check
           points etc.).

           03. Assess & edit

           Assess and edit your Postflight Terra 3D projects using the
           built-in rayCloud and Mosaic Editor functions.

           These allow you to further improve the accuracy of your
           mapping projects and annotate objects directly in the
           software.

           You can also import your results directly into any GIS, CAD or
           traditional photogrammetry software package you use.

                                           Postflight Terra 3D is included with every eBee drone

           04. Explore the rayCloud

           The rayCloud is a ground-breaking feature inside Postflight
           Terra 3D that combines the 3D point cloud with your original
           input images.

           This innovative approach to processing substantially increases
           the accuracy of 3D point estimates and provides you with a
           fuller understanding of your 3D results.

           Use the rayCloud to: 

                 Better view, assess and interpret your data
                 Gain full control over all your tie points, calibration and
                 results (assess and edit GCPs, check points and manual
                 tie points)
                 Annotate and measure polylines (breaklines), surfaces
                 and volumes (stockpiles) with the highest possible
                 precision
