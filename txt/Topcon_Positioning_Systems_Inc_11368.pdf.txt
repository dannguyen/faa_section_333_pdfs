                                                          Exemption No. 11368
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0103

Mr. E. Tazewell Ellett
Mr. Patrick R. Rizzi
Counsel for Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc.
Hogan Lovells US LLP
555 13th Street, NW
Washington, DC 20004

Dear Messrs. Ellett and Rizzi:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 14, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct aerial surveying, product demonstration flights for potential customers,
UAS product training for customers, and research and development.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the Sirius Basic and Sirius Pro.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Sirius Basic and
         Sirius Pro when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
                                                                                                            4

    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
    as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
              and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those
              who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;
           g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
           h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city,
              town, county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted and the altitudes
              essential to accomplish the operation.

    31. Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating persons
         consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production, as specified in the
         exemption holder's MPTOM.

Unless otherwise specified in this grant of exemption, the UAS, the UAS PIC, and the UAS
operations must comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to,
parts 45, 47, 61, and 91.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: THE PETITIONER
          Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. ("TPS"), a subsidiary of Topcon Corporation, is

headquartered in Livermore, California. TPS designs, manufactures, and distributes precise
positioning products for the global surveying, construction, agriculture, civil engineering, mapping,
asset management, and mobile control markets. TPS recently unveiled two small unmanned aircraft
systems ("UAS") ­ Sirius Basic and Sirius Pro (collectively, "Sirius UAS") ­ for mapping a wide range
of sites, land surveying, and facility inspections, as well as use in TPS' primary markets (e.g., mining
& aggregate, earth moving/construction, and agriculture). TPS also entered into a worldwide
distribution partnership agreement for these UAS with UAS manufacturer MAVinci GmbH
("MAVinci").

2. PROPOSED UAS OPERATIONS: THE EXEMPTION REQUEST
          Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ("FMRA") and 14

C.F.R. ("FAR") §§ 11.61(b), 11.63(a), and 11.81, TPS requests that the FAA grant TPS an
exemption from certain sections of the FAR (detailed below) so that TPS may commercially operate
one or more small Sirius UAS for aerial surveying, product demonstration flights for potential
customers, UAS product training for customers, and research and development for future product
improvements related to these small UAS. As explained below, TPS' proposed UAS operations, as
conditioned and limited herein, will not adversely affect safety, but rather will provide an equivalent
or greater level of safety than that provided by the current rules and large manned aircraft
operations. See FAR § 11.81.

\\DC - 026811/000011 - 6230588 v11
                                                                                                 HOGAN LOVELLS US LLP
3. PROPOSED CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

          The small UAS operations proposed in this Petition will be subject to the following conditions
and limitations. Each of these conditions and limitations is consistent with previously granted small
UAS Section 333 exemptions and FAA guidance. See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110 (December 10,
2014; Docket FAA-2014-0367) ("Trimble Exemption"); Exemption No. 11062 (September 25, 2014;
Docket FAA-2014-0352) ("Astraeus Exemption"); Exemption No. 11109 (December 10, 2014;
Docket FAA-2014-0507) ("Clayco Exemption"); Exemption No. 11136 (January 5, 2015; Docket
FAA-2014-0508) ("AAS Exemption"). Collectively, these conditions and limitations ensure that the
proposed small UAS operations will not adversely affect safety and will provide at least an equivalent
level of safety to the current rules and large manned aircraft operations.

                                    Each UA will remain at least 3 nautical miles from any public towered
                                    airport to the extent possible.
                                    (a) The Topcon Solutions Center in Pleasanton, California, where

                                                some UAS operations will be operated, is approximately 2.5
                                                miles south of the Livermore Municipal Airport, which has a
                                                control tower and runways in an east/west configuration. For
                                                these UAS operations at the Topcon Solutions Center, the
                                                PIC will follow the procedures set forth in Limitation 3.2.5
                                                below.
                                    Prior to each UAS operation in which the UA will operate within 3
                                    nautical miles of a public towered airport, the PIC will ensure that the
                                    FAA Air Traffic Control officials with responsibility for that airport are
                                    notified in advance of the UAS operation; that, subject to the airport's
                                    and ATC's agreement, the PIC will maintain two-way radio
                                    communications with the airport's ATC tower facility during such flight
                                    operations; and that the operation is conducted in accordance with a
                                    NOTAM as required by TPS' COA.
                                    Prior to UAS operations, the radio frequency spectrum used for
                                    operation and control of the UA (2.4 GHz) will comply with Federal
                                    Communications Commission (FCC) and other appropriate government

                                      The PIC will be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his/her
                                      designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the
                                      VO/FA can perform the functions prescribed for the VO/FA in the
                                      Operator's Manual. [Trimble Exemption Limitations Nos. 4 and 5.]
                         3.2.8 The UA will be operated within visual line of sight ("VLOS") of the PIC
                                      at all times. The VLOS will be unaided, except for corrective lenses as
                                      set forth on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate. The
                                      VO/FA may be used to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the
                                      PIC always maintains VLOS capability. [Trimble Exemption Limitations

          In accordance with FMRA Sec. 333, TPS requests that the Secretary of Transportation
determine that TPS' proposed small UAS operations (i) do not create a hazard to users of the
National Airspace System or the public, and (ii) do not pose a threat to national security.

          TPS further requests that, based on the Secretary's determination, the FAA determine ­ as it
did in the Astraeus Exemption, Clayco Exemption, and AAS Exemption ­ that relief from FAR Part
21 and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of FAR Part 36 is not necessary
for the UAS operations proposed in this Petition.1

          5.3 The extent of relief sought and the reason relief is sought:
          TPS proposes to conduct small UAS operations, as described herein, for aerial surveying,
product demonstration flights for potential customers, UAS product training for customers, and
research and development for future product improvements related to these small UAS. In order to
be able to conduct these UAS operations, TPS petitions the FAA, pursuant to FAR §§ 11.61(b),
11.63(a), and 11.81(b), for an exemption from the following FAR for the reasons noted:

          FAR § 61.113(a) and (b) ­ Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.
          The regulation states, in relevant part:

                                         (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section,
                                         no person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in
                                         command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for
                                         compensation or hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire,
                                         act as pilot in command of an aircraft.
                                         (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in
                                         command of an aircraft in connection with any business or

          TPS requests an exemption from this regulation to the extent necessary to permit TPS to
conduct UAS operations using PICs who hold an FAA private pilot certificate. While TPS recognizes
that the FAA normally requires a PIC to hold a commercial pilot certificate where there is
compensation either to the pilot or for the operation, TPS requests that the FAA exempt TPS and its
PICs from this requirement since the use of a private pilot as the PIC for the UAS operations under
this exemption will be more safe than the use of a commercial pilot for manned aircraft operations.
Unlike conventional aircraft, the Sirius UAS is remotely controlled, with no crew or passengers, and
battery-powered. The fulfillment of the additional requirements for a private pilot to become qualified
as a commercial pilot would not lead to any additional safety benefits when UAS operations are
involved.
          The differences between the aeronautical knowledge requirements for private pilots and for
commercial pilots are significant in the traditional world of manned aircraft. A pilot who wishes to
operate flights that involve the carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire is typically
expected to improve his or her aeronautical knowledge with respect to the operation of those larger
manned aircraft. For instance, the prospective commercial pilot is expected to be able to operate
more complex aircraft and in conditions other than VMC. Pilots seeking to become commercial
pilots for manned aircraft must acquire additional aeronautical knowledge about the use of
performance charts and aeronautical charts (beyond that which a private pilot must obtain for VFR),
night operations, and the use of air navigation aids/facilities.2 However, no aspect of this

2 FAR § 61.125, Aeronautical knowledge for commercial pilots, paras. (b)(7) (use of performance charts), (b)(9) (use
of aeronautical charts beyond that necessary for flight under VFR), (b)(10) (use of air navigation aids), and (b)(14)
(night and high-altitude operations).

incremental additional knowledge is significant for the daytime, VMC small UAS operations over
private or controlled access properties proposed in this Petition.

          The differences between the aeronautical experience requirements for private pilots and for
commercial pilots are also significant. However, the additional experience required for a commercial
pilot certificate is required to a great extent to allow the upgrading pilot to acquire experience of a
type that a commercial PIC of a manned aircraft must obtain in order to safely conduct commercial
operations in a larger manned aircraft. For instance, the applicant for a commercial certificate with a
single-engine land rating must obtain 50 hours of cross-country flight, 10 hours of instrument
training, 10 hours of time in a complex aircraft, 10 hours of solo time, and 5 hours in night VFR
conditions.3 In addition, a great deal of time is required for a pilot of a larger manned aircraft seeking
to become a commercial pilot to ensure that the pilot's takeoffs and landings can be conducted
safely enough so as not to imperil the passengers and property aboard the manned aircraft. In this
regard, there is a fundamental difference between the type of experience that the PIC of a manned
aircraft should have, versus the type of experience that the PIC of a small UAS should have, in order
to avoid imperiling passengers or property. In TPS' case, the small amount of property carried
aboard the UA will be TPS property. While the pilot will be compensated, all risk of damage to the
property (in fact to the UAS itself) will be borne by TPS. There is no expectation or need for the PIC
of the UA to have the type of experience that a commercial pilot for a manned aircraft would have.
In short, almost none of the aeronautical experience requirements, beyond those necessary for
private pilots and as set forth in the Sirius UAS manufacturer's written authorized training program, is
relevant to the PIC who will operate the small UAS over private or controlled access property as
proposed in this Petition. Accordingly, there is no reason to require the UAS PIC to have more
experience than that required for the private pilot certificate.

          The differences between flight proficiency requirements for private pilots and for commercial
pilots involve areas such as "[h]igh-altitude operation" and other areas that have no bearing on the

3 See FAR § 61.129.

small UAS operations at issue in this Petition.4 To the extent that differences exist between the
standards of performance for flight proficiency as demonstrated by prospective private versus
prospective commercial pilots, those standards are not significant here where the operations will be
conducted strictly during daylight VMC conditions, within VLOS, at altitudes no higher than 400 feet
AGL.

          Given that TPS plans to operate its Sirius UAS in Class G airspace over private or
controlled-access property at altitudes of 400 feet AGL or less, the parallel nature of private pilot
aeronautical knowledge requirements to those of commercial requirements, the limited airmanship
skills necessary to operate the Sirius UAS, and the lack of additional safety benefits for the proposed
UAS operations here resulting from commercial pilot experience, the PIC under this exemption
should only be required to hold a private pilot certificate and third-class airman medical certificate.
Such a condition would be consistent with the certificate requirements imposed on the PIC in the
Astraeus Exemption, Trimble Exemption, AAS Exemption, and Clayco Exemption.

          For these reasons, TPS requests that the FAA grant an exemption to permit TPS to use as
PIC of the proposed UAS operations pilots who hold a private pilot certificate and a third-class
airman medical certificate, so long as they satisfy the conditions and limitations proposed in this
Petition, including the PIC qualification and training requirements.

          FAR § 91.7(a) ­ Civil aircraft airworthiness.
          The regulation states in relevant part:

          TPS requests an exemption from this provision to the extent necessary.5 The Sirius UAS will

not require an airworthiness certificate under FAR Part 21, Subpart H, and thus relief is requested

from this regulation. See Trimble Exemption, at 16. An exemption is warranted because TPS

understands that, notwithstanding the lack of an airworthiness certificate, the FAA will consider its

"compliance with [TPS'] Manuals to be sufficient means for determining an airworthy condition" and

that TPS must still determine the UA's airworthiness prior to each flight based on compliance with

such Manuals. See Trimble Exemption, at 16.

          FAR § 91.119(b) and (c) ­ Minimum safe altitudes: General.

          The regulation states:

                                         Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate
                                         an aircraft below the following altitudes:

                                         (a) Anywhere. An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency

                                         2,000 feet of the aircraft.

                                         the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In
                                         those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to
                                         any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.

                                                   (2) A powered parachute or weight-shift-control aircraft may
                                                   be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in
                                                   paragraph (c) of this section.
          TPS requests an exemption from this regulation to the extent necessary to permit TPS to
conduct its UAS operations at altitudes lower than those permitted by FAR § 91.119, since such
altitudes are one of the key benefits of using small UAS for these flights. Even at these low
altitudes, TPS' UAS operations will be conducted at a level of safety at least equal to that which
would be achieved if larger manned aircraft were to be used at the altitudes required by FAR §
91.119.
          With respect to paragraph (a), TPS intends to comply with this requirement to the same
extent as would a manned aircraft, meaning that the UA must operate at an altitude such that the
loss of a single power unit aboard the UA or used by the UAS would still permit an emergency
landing "without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface." TPS agrees with the FAA's
reasoning on this issue in the Astraeus Exemption, at 20, and therefore does not believe that relief is
required from paragraph (a).
          With respect to paragraph (b), TPS plans to operate these small UAS over private or
controlled-access properties, which are not themselves congested areas, but which may be located
within a broader heavily populated and congested area. Accordingly, TPS does not believe that an
exemption is warranted from this paragraph covering "congested areas". However, as the FAA has
noted (Trimble Exemption, at 18), there is no precise definition of "congested areas," and the PIC
can obtain such information from the local Flight Standards District Office; but, even if these small
UAS operations were to operate over areas somehow construed as being "congested", the proposed
UAS operations will be far safer than operations by larger manned aircraft operating in compliance
with the minimum altitude requirements (1,000 feet altitude). The operation of a much heavier,
faster aircraft with an onboard pilot and other crewmembers, at 1,000 feet over a congested area,
with a load of combustible fuel, unquestionably provides a lower level of safety than an operation
conducted by a very small, extremely lightweight, battery-operated UA over private or controlled

access property that, at all times from takeoff to landing, can be safely operated well below the
altitudes used by manned aircraft and continuously within VLOS of the PIC on the ground. To the
extent necessary, TPS requests relief from paragraph (b).

          With respect to paragraph (c), TPS requests an exemption to allow UAS operations down to
the surface, both in sparsely populated areas and in "other than congested" areas. TPS' UAS
operations require lower-level flying, but have a number of self-imposed restrictions to ensure at
least an equivalent level of safety. For example,

                All operations will avoid congested or populated areas.
                All operations will be conducted over private or controlled access property.
                Permission from the land owner/controller will be obtained prior to the beginning of

                    each flight.
                TPS will timely file a NOTAM for each flight.
                The UA will operate at least 500 feet from all non-participating persons, vessels,

                    vehicles, and structures unless:
                         o Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect non-participating
                               persons from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. TPS must
                               ensure that non-participating persons remain under such protection; and if a
                               situation arises where non-participating persons leave such protection and
                               are within 500 feet of the UA, flight operations will cease immediately; and/or
                         o The UA is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the land
                               owner/controller has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
                               assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined
                               that it does not present an undue hazard.

          Even with a grant of this exemption, the UAS operations will be at least as safe as operations
by manned aircraft that comply with this paragraph. Flying a manned aircraft, given its weight, size,
speed, and fuel load, would pose a significant risk relative to the use of a small UA, with a smaller

size and weight, operating at much lower speeds, with batteries rather than a significant fuel load,

and at all times within VLOS of the PIC on the ground who has a wide view. Accordingly, as the

FAA determined in the Trimble Exemption, at 17-18, relief is warranted here provided that TPS

adheres to its Manuals and the additional conditions and limitations outlined above and in the

exemption. For these reasons, TPS requests relief from the entirety of paragraph (c).

          TPS does not request relief from paragraph (d), because it applies only to helicopters (and

allows operation at lower altitudes only if on a prescribed helicopter route) and powered parachute-

type aerial vehicles.

          It is not clear to TPS that an exemption from this section is required because, although the

regulation expressly applies only to aircraft maintaining a "cruising altitude" and dictates the altimeter

setting that must be used while at that cruising altitude, cruising altitudes for VFR flights do not begin

­ according to FAR § 91.159 ­ until "more than 3,000 feet above the surface".6 Nonetheless, TPS
requests an exemption from FAR § 91.121 to the extent necessary to permit TPS to conduct the
small UAS operations described in this Petition. See Astraeus Exemption, at 21-22 (granting relief
from this section with conditions and limitations).

          TPS recognizes the critical importance of ensuring that any UAS operated by TPS maintain
altitude to an accurate reference such that other aircraft and the FAA may rely on TPS's UAS to be
operating as proposed. The Sirius UAS does not use a barometric altimeter. Instead, it determines
altitude based on a GPS signal. To ensure the accuracy of the GPS signal, the PIC will check the
UA altitude reading prior to each takeoff, and will effectively zero the UA's altitude at the point of
takeoff, to ensure that measurements of the UA's altitude are as accurate as possible relative to the
local elevation. To the extent that this methodology does not satisfy FAR § 91.121 or any other
regulation, TPS requests an exemption to permit UAS operations using this methodology.

          FAR § 91.151 ­ Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.
          The regulation states:

                                         (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions
                                         unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is
                                         enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming
                                         normal cruising speed--

                                                   (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or
                                                   (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.
                                         (b) No person may begin a flight in a rotorcraft under VFR conditions
                                         unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is
                                         enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming
                                         normal cruising speed, to fly after that for at least 20 minutes.
          TPS requests an exemption from FAR § 91.151 to permit TPS to plan its UAS operations as
described above. The proposed small UAS operations in this Petition will (i) involve operations in
which one or more UAS is transported by means other than its own power to the operational

6 FAR § 91.159; see also Aeronautical Information Manual, at Chpt. 3, Sec. 1, Tbl. 3-1-1para. 3-1-2. (Jul. 24, 2014).

location, and (ii) begin and end at the operational site, with the takeoff, entire flight, and landing all
taking place within the immediate proximity to each other while remaining at all times within VLOS of
the PIC.

          The goal of FAR § 91.151 is to ensure that pilots plan for an extra 20 or 30 minutes of fuel at
their first intended point of landing in order to account for unexpected possible delays en route and
at the first planned destination. Many of these delays that plague manned aircraft are simply not an
issue with the proposed small UAS operations over private or controlled access property, because
there is virtually no "en route" portion of the flight, and any problems at the point of landing are
extremely unlikely to cause delays, since a UA can always land just a few feet away if the intended
point of landing becomes unusable.

          Given the relatively short operating time for the Sirius UAS (50 minutes), requiring a full 30
minutes of reserve "fuel" (battery power) could take up nearly all of the available time for UAS
operations. TPS believes that using a smaller reserve for UAS flight planning purposes will be at
least as safe as using the reserves required by FAR § 91.151 for manned aircraft. Using a reserve
of 30% battery power for a daylight UA flight, for instance, will be adequate where the UA is
essentially at its first point of landing from the moment it takes off (since there is no en route phase
of flight), since the risks for delay at the intended landing area are not as great as for manned aircraft
landings. To that end, and consistent with AAS Exemption Limitation No. 22, the PIC under the
requested exemption will be prohibited from beginning a UAS flight unless (considering wind and
forecast weather conditions) there is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended
landing point and land the UA with at least 30% battery power remaining. TPS believes that these
limitations will further ensure that the proposed reserve planning and operational requirements that
TPS is requesting to use under the exemption will provide at least an equivalent level of safety.

          For these reasons, TPS requests an exemption from FAR § 91.151(a) to permit it to plan and
conduct UAS operations such that only 30% of the battery power (instead of 30 minutes) is available

applicable to the small UAS operations TPS is proposing.

          FAR § 91.405(a) ­ Maintenance required.
          The regulation states, in relevant part:

                                         Each owner or operator of an aircraft--
                                         (a) Shall have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this
                                         part and shall between required inspections, except as provided in
                                         paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as
                                         prescribed in part 43 of this chapter;
                                         (b) ****.
          TPS requests an exemption from FAR § 91.405(a) to permit TPS to conduct the UAS
operations proposed in this Petition without having to perform the inspections and discrepancy
repairs required by FAR § 91.405(a). In the Astraeus Exemption and the Trimble Exemption, the
FAA determined that the proposed UAS operations required exemption from FAR § 91.405(a), and
that the achievement of an adequate level of safety required certain conditions and limitations, some
of which were proposed by the petitioner and some of which were imposed by the FAA. These
included requirements to develop and document maintenance, overhaul, replacement, and
inspection requirements in the absence of manufacturer's requirements; procedures to document
and maintain maintenance records with regard to the petitioner's UAS; UAS technician qualification
criteria; and requirements to document comprehensive preflight inspection procedures.
          TPS has proposed several conditions and limitations in Section 3 of this Petition related to
maintenance and inspections consistent with those in the Astraeus Exemption and the Trimble
Exemption. TPS believes that these conditions and limitations provide a level of safety at least
equivalent to that provided by FAR § 91.405(a), the Astraeus Exemption, and the Trimble
Exemption. For this reason, TPS requests an exemption from FAR § 91.405(a) to permit TPS to
conduct UAS operations as proposed in this Petition, subject to the conditions and limitations

proposed above, without having to perform the inspections and discrepancy repairs required by FAR
§ 91.405(a).

          TPS does not believe that an exemption from the remaining paragraphs of FAR § 91.405 is
required, since TPS will make appropriate logbook entries in aircraft maintenance records in
accordance with paragraph (b), appropriately mark any inoperative instrument or item of equipment
for which maintenance has been properly deferred in compliance with paragraph (c), and
appropriately placard listed discrepancies that include inoperative instruments or equipment in
compliance with paragraph (d).

          FAR § 91.407(a)(1) ­ Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding

          TPS has proposed maintenance-related conditions and limitations in this Petition, which it
believes provide a level of safety at least equivalent to that provided by FAR § 91.407(a)(1) and the

          TPS does not believe that an exemption from the remaining paragraphs of FAR § 91.407 is
required, since TPS will require that maintenance record entries are made as required, in
compliance with paragraph (a)(2), and since no persons will be carried following maintenance
performed on the UAS, making paragraphs (b) and (c) moot.

          TPS requests an exemption from FAR § 91.417(a) and (b) to permit TPS to conduct UAS

operations as proposed in this Petition without having to keep the records described in FAR §

91.417(a) and (b). The FAA determined in the Trimble Exemption and the Astraeus Exemption that

the proposed UAS operations required exemption from FAR § 91.417(a) and (b), and that an

adequate level of safety required conditions and limitations similar to those set forth in those

previously-granted exemptions.

          TPS has proposed maintenance, inspection, and records-related conditions and limitations in
this Petition, which it believes provide a level of safety at least equivalent to that provided by FAR §
91.417(a) and (b), the Trimble Exemption, and the Astraeus Exemption. For this reason, TPS
requests an exemption from FAR § 91.417(a) and (b) to permit TPS to conduct UAS operations as
proposed in this Petition, subject to the proposed conditions and limitations, without having to keep
the records described in FAR § 91.417(a) and (b).

          Additional FAR Provisions.
          The Petition does not seek exemption from certain regulations based on the reasoning and
FAA precedent outlined below in the footnote.7
          However, TPS also requests that, to the extent that the FAA concludes that an exemption
from one or more other provisions of the FAR would be required to permit the UAS operations

7 This Petition does not seek exemption from:
> FAR Part 21 or 36, based on the reasoning in the Astraeus Exemption, at 14, and Clayco Exemption, at 10.
> FAR § 91.7(b), based on the reasoning in the Trimble Exemption, at 17.
> FAR §§ 91.9(b)(2) and 91.203(a) and (b), based on the reasoning in the FAA's August 8, 2014 Memorandum titled
"Interpretation regarding whether certain required documents may be kept at an unmanned aircraft's control station"
("FAA's August 8, 2014 Memorandum"), the Astraeus Exemption, at 19-20, 22, and the Trimble Exemption, at 17, 20.
> FAR §§ 45.23(b) and 91.9(c), based on the reasoning in the Astraeus Exemption, at 14, and Trimble Exemption,
at 14, related to FAR § 45.23(b), and assuming that the markings on the UA used to comply with FAR Part 45,
Subpart C requirements are as large as practicable.
> FAR §§ 47.3(b)(2) and 47.31(c), based on the reasoning in the FAA's August 8, 2014 Memorandum, and
assuming that all UA are registered in accordance with FAR Part 47.
> FAR § 91.103(b)(2), based on the FAA's reasoning in the Astraeus Exemption, at 20, and Clayco Exemption, at
14, which concluded that an exemption from the preflight action requirements is not necessary when the grant of an
exemption for UAS operations includes conditions that satisfy preflight action requirements. TPS proposes such
conditions in this Petition.
> FAR § 91.109, based on the FAA's reasoning in the Astraeus Exemption, at 20, and Clayco Exemption, at 14,
which concluded that an exemption from the requirement for dual flight controls for flight or simulator training or for
flight testing is not necessary when there is no indication that dual flight controls will be used during any flight or
simulator training or flight testing.

described in this Petition, the FAA grant an exemption from those FAR provisions as necessary to
permit the UAS operations described in this Petition.8

          5.4 Reasons why granting the request would be in the public interest:
          A grant of the exemption would be in the public interest because it would enhance safety for
the general public, TPS employees, and TPS customers.
          First, the ability to use a small UAS to conduct the operations described herein, subject to
the conditions and limitations proposed in this Petition, will enable TPS to have access to more
complete data about aerial surveys, topography, demonstration flights, and maintenance flights,
which ­ in turn ­ will enable TPS to conduct safe and effective aerial survey, demonstration or
maintenance/repair flights that minimize the risk of harm to the general public, TPS employees, and
TPS customers.
          Second, given TPS' primary objective of providing a functional and safe UAS, this exemption
would allow TPS to provide a comprehensive training, repair/service, and testing program for its
customers who operate, or seek to operate, the small Sirius UAS. It is in the public interest for TPS
to offer these types of programs so that (i) owners/operators of these small Sirius UAS are properly
educated about safe flight operations and (ii) repairs done to the Sirius UAS are appropriately tested.
          Third, the use of the small, lightweight, battery-powered Sirius UAS for these topographical
aerial surveys and related operations is far less risky than undertaking those operations with a much
heavier, much faster, much larger, manned helicopter or other aircraft loaded with fuel and a crew.
As the FAA acknowledged in the Trimble Exemption, at 13:
          "The [TPS] pilot and crew will be remotely located from the aircraft. The limited
          weight and construction with impact absorbent materials significantly reduces the
          potential harm to persons or damage to property in the event of an incident or
          accident. The risk to an onboard pilot and crew during an incident or accident is
          eliminated with the use of a UAS for the aerial surveying operation.

8 TPS would be happy to provide follow-on documentation providing the rationale underlying any such additional
exemptions.

                                                                                                 HOGAN LOVELLS US LLP
          Manned aircraft are at risk of fuel spillage and fire in the event of an incident or
          accident. [The Sirius UAS] carries no fuel [it is battery-powered] and therefore the
          risk of fire following an incident or accident due to fuel spillage is eliminated."
These distinctions, coupled with the safety-related features of the Sirius UAS such as Loss Link
Procedures, redundant flight control systems, real-time telemetry, airspace awareness system, and
terrain following, demonstrate that the Sirius UAS operations proposed in this Petition are far less
risky than if operated by larger and heavier manned aircraft.

          5.5 Reasons why granting the exemption would not adversely affect safety, or how
                    the exemption would provide a level of safety at least equal to that provided by
                    the rule from which exemption is sought:

          Throughout this Petition, TPS has explained many reasons why granting an exemption from
each section of the FAR from which relief is sought would result in UAS operations that provide a
level of safety at least equal to, or greater than, that provided by the rule from which exemption is
sought. Moreover, the many conditions and limitations proposed in this Petition also ensure at least
an equivalent level of safety, as the FAA concluded in the Trimble Exemption and the Astraeus
Exemption.

          In general, the risks of any proposed UAS operation interfering with a manned aircraft is
minimized by the low altitude at which the UAS will operate; the locations at which the UAS will
operate (e.g., Class G airspace, private or controlled access property, away from airports); the small
size/low weight and relatively slow speed of the Sirius UAS; the restriction of UAS operations to
VMC and daytime conditions; the requirement for the PIC to maintain VLOS of the UA at all times;
and the condition to obtain a NOTAM before each UAS flight, among other conditions and
limitations. The risks to persons or property on the ground are also minimized by the small size/low
weight of the Sirius UAS; the 500-foot set-off from non-participating persons or structures; the
prohibition on flights over congested or densely populated areas; the PIC's VLOS requirement; and
limiting operations to private or controlled access property, among others. These parameters,
conditions, and limitations proposed in the Petition provide substantial protection against

                                                               - 32 -

interference with manned aircraft operations or with the safety of persons or property on the ground.
In addition, under the proposed conditions and limitations in Section 3 of this Petition, TPS will
coordinate extensively, as warranted, with the FAA, with local airports, and with property owners to
ensure that all UAS operations under the exemption are at least as safe as would be manned aircraft
operations used for similar purposes.

          The Sirius UAS also has several safety-related protocols in case there is any lost link
between the UA and the operator. These Lost Link Procedures are covered in the Operator's
Manual and can handle lost links alone or in combination. As an example, if a GNSS link is lost, the
autopilot sends an error message to the computer notifying the computer operator, who can notify
the PIC to take control of the UAS and land. If the PIC does not take over control within a preset
time, the UAS will begin to circle slowly and descend to land. If an RC link and data link are both
lost, the UAS will return to the takeoff position and circle. The "return home command" can return
the UA to its takeoff position or to another location established as "home" during the creation of the
flight plan at any time during a flight. TPS can also end a UAS flight via a command from the
computer telling the UA to land at a defined area automatically, or the PIC can take control of the UA
using the RC controller.

          In addition, another key safety feature of the MAVinci System is its dual control links. The
MAVinci Ground Control Station ("GCS") and MAVinci Remote Control ("RC") consoles are dual,
robust, and independent systems, affording a redundant means of controlling the UA ­ significantly
increasing operational security. The 2.4 GHz RC console is connected wirelessly to the Sirius UA
for piloting in autopilot assisted and fully manual modes. The MAVinci GCS functions from the
laptop through the 2.4 GHz Connector antenna, providing fully autonomous flight. Should either
system fail, the other system remains fully operational and is capable of providing safety of flight for
the UAS.

          For these reasons, granting an exemption from each section of the FAR from which relief is

greater than, that provided by the rule from which exemption is sought.

                    Description of Relief Sought: Petitioner seeks an exemption to conduct small UAS
                    commercial operations for aerial surveying, product demonstration flights for potential
                    customers, UAS product training for customers, and research and development for
                    future product improvements related to these small UAS.

          5.7 Additional information that supports request:
          TPS is prepared to provide additional information that the FAA might find helpful, or to
answer questions in response to any FAA requests. A confidential copy of each of the Manuals and
the Topcon Certified Training Program will be submitted to the FAA Assistant Chief Counsel for
International Law, Legislation, and Regulations as supporting documentation for this Petition. The
Manuals and Topcon Certified Training Program contain information that is highly proprietary to TPS
and/or MAVinci, and TPS requests that the FAA treat the Manuals and Topcon Certified Training
Program as confidential and not disclose them to the public.

          5.8 Request to exercise the privileges of the exemption outside the U.S.:
          TPS does not request to exercise the privileges of the exemption outside the United States.
