                                                      Exemption No. 11314A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0958

Mr. Ryan K. Koffman
12289 Daisy Court
Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739

Dear Mr. Koffman:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated April 19, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
(hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your current exemption. That
exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to perform
aerial data collection and closed set motion picture and filming. You requested an
amendment to add the DJI S900 and Blade 350QX.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
                                                                                                 2

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing

requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11314
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11314 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire, DJI
    S900, and Blade 350QX when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
    Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
    amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

Re: Application to Amend Section 333 Exemption No. 11314 Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0958

Dear Sir or Madam:

By letter dated April 9, 2015 from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the request for exemption from
Section 333 was granted. The letter is marked Section 333 Exemption No. 11314 Regulatory Docket No. FAA-
2014-0958.

The petitioner, Ryan K. Koffman, requests the granted exemption be amended to include an additional UAS
type. The UAS requested is the DJI S900 and the Bade 350QX.

The reasoning for an additional UAS type was accidentally excluded in the original request for an amendment
dated April 19, 2015.

I believe there is an increased layer of safety by implementing the DJI S900 and the Blade 350QX. Due to the
decreased size of the UAS this would allow a smaller takeoff and landing area necessary for operation. The
requested UAS may be used to obtain the proper camera position/angle for production filming. Once the
UAS has acquired the necessary information with positive results the larger UAS may be utilized for the final
filming production.

The DJI S900 has a total weight of 8.2Kg or 18.1lbs. The dimensions are 900mm diagonally. The maximum
speed is not listed in the aircrafts operating manual (AOM) but will not exceed 50mph. The S900 has six
motors, Motor Model S900-021, powered by a 6-cell 10000mAh or 15000mAh Lithium Polymer battery.
There are six propellers in use, Propeller Model DJI S900-25. The S900 will be controlled with the Spektrum
DX8 remote controller with an operating frequency of 2.400GHz ­ 2.483GHz. The live video feed will have an
operating frequency of 5.728GHz ­ 5.850GHz.

The Blade 350QX has a total weight of 24oz or 680g. The dimensions are 18.30inch (465mm) in length and
5.43inch (138mm) in height with a main rotor diameter of 22.80inch (580mm). The maximum speed is not
listed in the AOM but will not exceed 50mph. The 350QX has four motors, Motor Model BLH7802, powered
by a 3 cell 2200mAh or 3000mAh Lithium Polymer battery. There are four propellers, Propeller Model APC
LP08038SF and LP08038SFP, in use. The 350QX will be controlled with the Spektrum DX8 remote controller

with an operating frequency of 2.400GHZ ­ 2.4835GHz. The live video feed will have an operating frequency
of 5.728GHz ­ 5.850GHz.
The Base Station that will be utilized is the Neewer 7inch LCD Diversity Receiver Monitor, Model RX-LCD5802.
The operating frequency is between 5645MHz ­ 5945MHz. The Neewer monitor is powered by an integrated
2 cell 2500mAh Lithium Polymer battery.
Thank you for your understanding and consideration. Please feel free to contact me if you have any
questions regarding this request or need additional information.

Sincerely,
