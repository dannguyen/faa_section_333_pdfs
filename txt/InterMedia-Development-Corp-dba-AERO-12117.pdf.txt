                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1079

Mr. Gregory S. Walden
Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP
Counsel for InterMedia Development Corp d/b/a AERO
Robert S. Strauss Building
1333 New Hampshire Avenue, NW.
Washington, DC 20036-1564

Dear Mr. Walden:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 13, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of InterMedia Development Corp d/b/a AERO (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for
an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial cinematography services, news gathering services, aerial sensor data collection,
aerial surveying and photogrammetry, aerial communications services (Wi-fi hotspot, FM
radio transmission, VHF radio repeater, cellular), and airborne emergency services support
(reconnaissance and communications).

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                               2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom, DJI S800, DJI S900, DJI S1000,
Arris hexacopter and Tarot quadcopter.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                3

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, InterMedia Development Corp d/b/a AERO is granted
an exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, InterMedia Development Corp d/b/a AERO is hereafter referred to
as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom, DJI
    S800, DJI S900, DJI S1000, Arris hexacopter and Tarot quadcopter when weighing
    less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will
    require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
                                                                                                            4

    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.
                                                                                                            5

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.
                                                                                                            6

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.
                                                                                               7

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;

Safety equivalence or no adverse effect on safety

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems

The DJI flight controller, the common control platform in the listed devices, has a number of
technological capabilities to demonstrate its airworthiness. In the event of a loss of GPS signal,
the UAV will lock in its position and automatically go to ATTI mode and remain stable. Loss of
connection to the remote control transmitter (or software navigation controller) causes the
vehicle to immediately achieve a preset altitude, and then return to its home point and land in a
controlled way.

All of the UAVs intended for use contain a power storage monitoring system and fail-safe modes
to force controlled landing before the power supply drops below operational levels. Should there
be a loss of power, the aircraft are designed to perform a vertical hard landing with propellers
providing stabilizing resistance during descent.

If the UAV encounters an unexpected obstacle, the pilot will either divert the flight or maintain
the UAV in a safe hover position away from the obstacle.

Petition for Exemption

Page 3 of7

Given its small size, operational capabilities, and restricted area in which the UAV will operate,
an exemption from Part 21, Subpart H, Airworthiness Certificates, and 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a), is
warranted, as IDC's UAV satisfies the equivalent level of safety as compared with manned
aircraft and meets the criteria in section 333. Operating the UAV without an airworthiness
certificate in the restricted environment over vacant private property under the conditions
proposed will be safer than operating a manned helicopter operating with an airworthiness
certificate and not subject to such conditions.

Each UAV (with payload) is less than 55 pounds, carry no explosive materials or flammable
liquid fuels, and would operate outside controlled airspace, with no passengers or crew on board.
As the FAA has found in granting an exemption to Clayco, Exemption No. 11109, at page 10:

         The limited weight significantly reduces the potential for harm to participating and
         nonparticipating individuals or property in the event of an incident or accident. The risk
         to an onboard pilot and crew during an incident or accident is eliminated with the use of a
         UAV for the aerial operations.

For the reasons outlined above, IDC also seeks an exemption from the certification requirements
for normal category rotorcraft in Part 27.

In support of IDC's request for an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(l),
91.409(a)(l) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), IDC will adhere to the following inspection and
maintenance program: IDC will inspect the UAV before and after each operation, as well as
perform daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections, as set forth in its operations manual.
Before each flight, the pilot in command will inspect the UAV to ensure it is in a safe condition
for flight. The preflight inspection will account for any discrepancy, such as an inoperable
component, item, or equipment. IDC will not initiate a flight if the inspection reveals a condition
that adversely affects the safety of operations, and will not operate that UAV until it is found to
be in a safe condition. Any UAV that has undergone maintenance or an alteration that affects the
UAV's operation or flight characteristics will undergo a functional flight test before return to
service.

IDC will follow the manufacturer's UAV requirements relating to components, maintenance,
overhaul, replacement, inspection and life limits. IDC will record all maintenance, alterations,
and the functional flight test in the UAV logbook, including total flight hours, description of
work accomplished, and the signature of the UAV technician who returned the UAV to service. 1

IDC's UAVs are equipped with an altimeter that provides the pilot with a constant digital display
of altitude. Moreover, the UAVs will be operated within the visual line of sight of the pilot in
command and observer and below 400 feet AGL. In addition, the flight controllers are
programmed not to allow the aircraft to exceed the 400 feet ceiling, even if the pilot command

input is in-conflict, or if communication with the remote control transmitter fails. Accordingly,
IDC does not believe an exemption from 14 C.P.R. 91.121 is required.

In support ofiDC's request for an exemption from fuel requirements in 14 C.P.R. 91.151(a) and
(b), IDC notes that its UAV is battery-powered and is operated for brief periods of time, within
the battery capacity of the UAV.

The remote control transmitter/receiver combinations will work within the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 Ghz
FCC-approved ranges.

UAV and UAS Operator Qualifications and Training

In support of IDC's request for an exemption from the pilot certification and qualifications
requirements in 14 C.P.R. 61.113(a) and (a), IDC asserts that an equivalent level of safety is
achieved by the UAV-specific experience of its Pilots. Each IDC pilot will receive a commercial
UAS training course and then receive flight training using the DJI Phantom, Inspire 1, S800,
S900, SlOOO, Tarot and/or Arris UAS.

IDC recognizes the FAA's position that section 333 does not allow the FAA to waive the
requirement of a UAV operator to hold an airman certificate, relying on section 44711. Section
333 is a more recent enactment and provides explicit authority to the FAA to exempt a UAV
operator from any certification requirement. Section 333 instructs the FAA to consider whether
to require airworthiness certificates, certificates of waiver, and certificates of authorization, "at a
minimum." Thus, Congress vested FAA with discretion to waive certificate requirements other
than an airworthiness certificate, including an airman and medical certificates.

Even if the pilot certification requirement is not waived, FAA has exemption authority under
section 44701 (f) to exempt UAV operators from the particular requirements of Parts 61 and 67 -
such as the requirement to conduct flight training on board an aircraft - and develop airman
certification requirements specifically designed for small UAV operations. Applying manned
aircraft pilot certification requirements to small UAVs is not necessary as a matter of safety, and
does not make sense as a matter of public policy.

IDC believes that FAA's determination in the Astraeus Aerial and other exemptions that a
commercial pilot certificate is not required for the operators of UAVs for closed set filming, set
forth below (emphasis added), applies equally to the nature of its UAS operations:

         [T]he experience obtained beyond a private pilot certificate in pursuit of a commercial
         pilot certificate in manned flight does not necessarily aid a pilot in the operational
         environment proposed by the petitioner; the FAA considers the overriding safety factor
        for the limited operations proposed by the petitioner to be the airmanship skills acquired
         through VAS-specific flight cycles, flight time, and specific make and model experience,
         culminating in verification through testing.

IDC believes this reasoning supports a UAVIUAS-focused training and experience regimen that
should obviate not only a commercial pilot certificate but also a private pilot certificate because
any training will be focused on the particular skills of operating the particular small UAV and the
particular nature ofUAS operations.

IDC notes that the FAA has proposed in its recent sUAS Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that a
small UAS operator would be required to successfully complete an aeronautical knowledge test,
but would not be required to obtain a commercial or private pilot certificate. Also, medical
certification would be obviated by a pilot's self-certification before flight that the pilot is
physically and mentally fit to operate the UAS.

Accordingly, the FAA should grant appropriate exemption relief to permit IDC to use pilots who
have successfully completed commercial UAS training and have also gained flying experience
using the DJI Phantom, Inspire 1, S800, Arris, or Tarot UAV. In the event the FAA does not
grant such relief, IDC will employ a suitably certificated private pilot.

UAV and UAS Operating Parameters

IDC will operate its UAVs in full compliance with any local permit or safety ordinance, in
accordance with its manual. IDC's typical flight will be operated under 400 feet AGL and
within 2 km of the operator.

All flights will be conducted within the visual line of sight of the pilot in command, within non-
controlled airspace, with the consent of any property owner and/or developer. Although the
UAV may be operated in a metropolitan area, it will be controlled and monitored only by
authorized personnel, and be flown below 400 feet AGL, except in rare occasions where a
sponsoring agency or organization requires data from higher altitudes, or where the terrain below
would require extreme maneuvers to comply with the altitude restriction. However, in such rare
cases, appropriate pre-flight site surveys would be undertaken (where possible) to minimize any
risk of collision or any negative impact with any aircraft operations in that airspace, and in any
event all such operations would be within the visual line of sight of the operator. For any
operations over 400 feet AGL, IDC will coordinate with Air Traffic Control and obtain a
Certificate of Authorization if required. Thus, these rare and brief operations at an altitude over
400 feet AGL will pose no risk to manned aircraft. Accordingly, IDC requests that standard term
4 be revised to permit IDC to operate its UAVs higher than 400 feet AGL when authorized by
Air Traffic Control.

IDC will also notify the appropriate Flight Standards District Office "("FSDO") and Air Traffic
Control for any operation within five miles of an airport.

IDC will conduct a briefing before each day's operations, which all personnel participating in the
operations must attend. IDC will obtain written consent of any person who will be participating
in the operations or otherwise be on the private property where operations are to take place.
IDC will provide notice to any adjacent buildings or structures.

IDC will limit its operations to daytime Visual Flight Rules ("VFR").

IDC seeks an exemption from the requirement in 14 C.F.R. 91.119, subsection (b), that an
aircraft must remain at least 1,000 feet above any congested area or open air assembly of
persons, and subsection (c), that an aircraft must remain at least 500 feet above any person or
structure in an area other than populated or congested, and not closer than 500 feet to any person,
vehicle, or structure. These requirements were adopted with fixed-wing, manned aircraft
operations in mind. While IDC may operate its UAVs in a metropolitan area, the operations will
be carefully pre-planned to minimize risk to persons or property, avoid intrusion into
unauthorized airspace, and avoid a public annoyance. Its UAVs will not be operated over a
highly-congested area or open air assembly of persons.

IDC will make every reasonable effort to ensure that no unauthorized person will be on the land
over which the UAVs will be operated, and will provide notice to adjacent buildings and furnish
proctors as may be necessary to ensure that unauthorized persons do not come within the narrow
parameters in which the UAVs will be operated. Combined with the technological capabilities
of the UAVs and that the UAVs will be operated within the visual line of sight of the pilot and an
observer, IDC submits that its operational limitations provides an equivalent level of safety to
that provided in section 91.119.

For news gathering operations as well as for emergency services support, IDC seeks a revision to
standard term and condition 27, which provides that "All operations shall be conducted over
private or controlled-access property with permission from the property owner/controller or
authorized representative. Permission from property owner/controller or authorized
representative will be obtained for each flight to be conducted." For news gathering and
emergency services support operations, it would be impractical to require advance notice and
 approval from private property owners. Precautions outline above will be taken by IDC to
 minimize any risk to persons on the ground.

 Public interest

 IDC's UAS operations will substantially benefit public and private organizations which have an
 interest in gathering critical information - atmospheric, situational, etc. - to support their
 operations. Depending on the use-case, these scenarios may include:

     · aerial cinematography or photography (in support of government, commercial or non-
          profit organizations)

     · the gathering of sensor data to document or provide real-time awareness of potential
          radiologic or biohazards present in an operational area,

      · traffic or construction monitoring,
      · ecological, agricultural or land management surveying,
      · infrastructure surveying and improvement,
InterMedia Development Corporation

    · area-specific communications (specifically FM radio, Wi-fi, and cellular- in accordance
         with existing FCC guidance).

Additionally, news-gathering organizations that would normally utilize fixed cameras, mobile
ground camera crews, or manned aircraft in support of their news operations, would be able to
receive transmitted video via IDC's UAVs without risking air-crews during potentially
hazardous situations, while minimizing intrusion into the airspace above the situation of interest.

Operating UAVs under the limitations proposed by IDC will avoid any risk of harm to pilots as
well as persons and people on the ground that would be present during the operation of manned
helicopters. UAS operations will also require a much smaller energy footprint than with manned
helicopters.

Operations limited to the United States

IDC does not intend to operate its UAVs outside ofthe United States.

Summaryfor Federal Register

Should the FAA determine that publication of a summary is required, IDC submits the following
summary to be included in the Federal Register:

         IDC seeks an exemption to operate the DJI Inspire 1, S800, S900, S1000, and Phantom
         unmanned aircraft systems, and the Arris and Tarot unmanned aircraft systems, all with
         DJI flight controllers, to perform commercial and emergency services.

Sincerely,
