                                                           Exemption No. 12138
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1620

Mr. Thomas Dickey
sUAS Manager
Garner Environmental Services, Inc.
1717 West 13th Street
Deer Park, Texas 77536

Dear Mr. Dickey:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 25, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Garner Environmental Services, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial photography , surveying, mapping, andvideography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 and DJI S1000.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Garner Environmental Services, Inc. is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Garner Environmental Services, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2 and
    DJI S1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
                                                                                                            4

    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Exemption Request under Section 333 of the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization
and Reform Act of 2012 and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Garner Environmental Services, Inc., operator of Small Unmanned
Aircraft Systems ("sUASs") equipped to conduct aerial photography for the purpose of emergency
response to incidents involving hazardous materials, industrial services, disaster services and
support, topographical surveying, and mapping, hereby applies for an exemption from the listed
Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of its sUASs, so long as
such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be
established by the FAA as required by Section 333.

         These limitations provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to
operations under the current regulatory structure specifically, a safety enhancement to aerial
imagery and videography conducted by manned aviation operations.

         The use of Small Unmanned Aerial Systems ("sUASs") for aerial imagery and
videography by Garner Environmental Services, Inc. reduces the need to use manned aircraft
activities to perform the same function. Furthermore, the ability to use sUASs reduces the
exposure risk to personnel operating in a hazardous environment by negating the need to make
reconnaissance entries into areas without adequate intelligence. Therefore, it is in the best
interest of the Public for the FAA to approve the requested exemptions.

Sincerely,

Thomas Dickey

Any sUAS incidents, accidents or flight operations that transgress the lateral or vertical
boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA shall be reported to the
FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents shall be reported to the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions on the NTSB web
site: www.ntsb.gov.

Unless otherwise specified in this petition, the sUAS PIC and the sUAS operations shall comply
with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45, 47, 61 and 91.

The sUAS shall not be operated over congested or densely populated areas. These areas
include, but are not limited to, the yellow areas depicted on World Aeronautical Charts (WAC),
Sectional Aeronautical Charts (Sectionals), or Terminal Area Charts (TAC). Each work site will
also be evaluated based on local conditions.

Operations of sUAS may be conducted at distances less than 500 feet from participating persons,
vessels, vehicles, or structures that perform an essential function in connection with these special
purpose operations. Operations closer than 500 feet from the PIC, VO, operator trainees and
essential persons are permitted when operationally necessary; but never so close to present an
undue hazard. This is consistent with Exemption No. 11138.

Operations of sUAS may be conducted at distances less than 500 feet from unoccupied vessels,
vehicles or structures owned by the land owner/controller when the land owner/controller grants
such permission, and the PIC makes a safety assessment of the risk from the operations and
determines that it does not present an undue hazard to persons or property. This is consistent
with Exemption No. 11138.

Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all non-participating persons unless
barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect non-participating persons from the sUAS
and/or debris in the event of an accident. Garner Environmental Services, Inc. shall ensure that
non-participating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where non-
participating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the sUAS, flight operations
will cease immediately. This is consistent with Exemption No. 11138.

All operations of sUAS shall be conducted with the permission from the land owner/controller or
authorized representative. Permission from the land owner/controller or authorized representative
will be obtained for each flight to be conducted.

The sUAS will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted on a
current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
management is obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM as
required by the operator's COA. The letter of agreement with the airport management will be
made available to the Administrator upon request. This is consistent with Exemption No. 11159.

The sUAS must be operated within VLOS of the PIC and VO at all times. This requires the PIC to
be able to use human vision to see the sUAS unaided by any device other than corrective lenses,
as specified on the PIC's FAA issued medical certificate.

All sUAS operations must utilize a VO. The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS requirement as
long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability. The VO and PIC must be able to
communicate verbally at all times. The PIC and the VO must be designated before the flight and
cannot transfer his or her designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the
VO can perform the functions prescribed in Garner Environmental Services, Inc. Health and
Safety Plan.

The sUAS will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle. Operations will not
be conducted at night as defined in 14 CFR 1.1.

Garner Environmental Services, Inc. will conduct preflight safety risk assessments to determine
that the sUAS is in a condition for safe flight (14 CFR Section 91.7(B)) and that the planned
operations can be completed safely. Specific procedures are addressed in Garner Environmental
Services, Inc. Health and Safety Plan and the sUAS Operators Manual.

Should operations require a notification to the Flight Standards District Office, such as pipeline or
power line patrol, Garner Environmental Services, Inc. will notify the appropriate office via letter of
intent at least 72 hours prior to the operation.

Garner Environmental Services, Inc. shall obtain an Air Traffic Organization issued Certificate of
Waiver or Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under this requested grant of
exemption. Additionally, Garner Environmental Services, Inc. will request a Notice to Airmen
(NOTAM) not more than 72 hours, but not less than 48 hours prior to the operation.

Public Interest

Garner Environmental Services, Inc. operations of sUAS to perform aerial imagery and
videography will reduce risk to life and property by decreasing the requirements of personnel to
operate manned aircraft to perform these tasks. Garner Environmental Services, Inc. will use
battery-powered sUAS that serve as safe and efficient alternatives to the manned aircraft
commonly utilized to conduct aerial imagery and videography. Also, the flight data, inspection
results, recorded observations and lessons learned from these operations will be compiled to
further enhance its current safety program.

The applicant proposes that the exemptions requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. The limitations provide for at
least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory
structure because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to aerial imagery
and videography conducted by manned aircraft.
