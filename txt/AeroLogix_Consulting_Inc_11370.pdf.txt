                                                          Exemption No. 11370
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0094

Mr. Timothy J. Briggs
AeroLogix Consulting, Inc.
101 1st Street, SE.
New Prague, MN 56071

Dear Mr. Briggs:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 15, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of AeroLogix Consulting, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial survey to produce imagery and terrain modeling products useful in applications
ranging from civil engineering, land and water resources management, environmental
research, disaster response, agriculture, and many other useful applications.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is an AeroLogix GeoStar.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, AeroLogix Consulting, Inc. is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, AeroLogix Consulting, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the AeroLogix
         GeoStar when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
                                                                                                               6

       Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
       as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
       documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

Introduction

          AeroLogix Consulting Inc. ("AeroLogix") is the designer, builder and the operator of the GeoStar sUAS aerial imaging
system. The system is capable of creating high resolution geospatial ("GIS") imagery and engineering grade survey products. The
heart of the system is the GeoStar UAV, a semi-autonomous fixed wing aircraft with electric power and a payload capacity exceeding
10 pounds. AeroLogix currently operates the GeoStar sUAS as a public aircraft in partnership with Le Sueur County, Minnesota
under FAA Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA), 2014-CSA-35. AeroLogix prepared and submitted all COA application
requirements and documentation on behalf of Le Sueur County. COA 2014-CSA-35 is included for your reference to this application.
AeroLogix is seeking exemptions under the provisions of Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ("The
Reform Act") to commercially operate additional GeoStar UAV airframes to multiple public and private customers. AeroLogix seeks
to operate the identical sUAS system in similar operational and airspace conditions as previously vetted and approved in COA 2014-
CSA-35.

GeoStar sUAS Public Operations in 2014

          The AeroLogix/Le Sueur County partnership was awarded one of Minnesota's first and largest public-use COAs, 2014-CSA-
35. FAA authorization was granted on 25 August, 2014 to begin operations of the GeoStar sUAS throughout most of Le Sueur
County in Class E and G airspace. Except for five densely populated towns and two airport areas, all of rural Le Sueur County was

Flight operations began in early September 2014 and continued without incident through late November 2014 when snow cover
prevented further aerial surveys. During that time, 14 GeoStar missions were safely conducted from multiple locations in Le Sueur
County. The GeoStar UAV met or exceeded all design and performance goals and the program was well received by the general
public and local press.1,2,3 AeroLogix and Le Sueur County intend to resume regular operations under COA 2014-CSA-35 in the
spring of 2015 in various locations within Le Sueur County to survey agricultural ditches and to provide imagery and engineering
products for other county civil engineering projects.

                                                                         GeoStar UAV

          The GeoStar UAV saw immediate success as a safe and stable aerial photography platform. It was quickly demonstrated
how AeroLogix and the GeoStar sUAS were capable of creating high resolution geospatial ("GIS") imagery and engineering grade
survey products, at a fraction of the cost of conventional providers. The Le Sueur County program and the products that were created
generated immediate interest among local GIS users and civil engineering professionals. The following institutions have expressed

Review of Section 333 Conditions.

          The Congressional mandate in Section 333 of the Reform Act allows a limited introduction of commercial Unmanned Aerial
Systems (UASs) into the national airspace system in advance of permanent rulemaking, if it can be accomplished safely. The
Secretary is given the discretion to determine which types of UASs do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a
threat to national security when considering the following:

          -The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
          -Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
          -Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.

We shall address these conditions as they apply to GeoStar sUAS and the proposed operations.

GeoStar UAV Dimensions and Weights:

          The FAA defines "Small Unmanned Aerial Systems" (sUAS) as those that weigh less than 55 pounds. The GeoStar UAV

normally flies at an operational weight of 21-25 pounds, depending on desired battery load. The GeoStar is entirely electric powered

with independent circuits for main propulsion, avionics and telemetry. The GeoStar UAV is constructed with a hollow fiberglass

fuselage. Wings are made from a foam core with carbon fiber reinforcements and then sheeted with a fiberglass strengthened wood

veneer. The following physical specifications are provided:
          a. Wingspan: 157.4" (13'1")

GeoStar UAV Operating Speeds

          The GeoStar UAV was designed as a stable fixed wing aerial photography platform with electric power and good payload
capacity. Slower operational speeds were desired to maximize photographic performance and were achieved through substantial wing
area and relatively light wing loadings. Internal mounting of all components minimizes aerodynamic drag and an efficient sailplane-
derived airfoil displays excellent handling characteristics across the speed range. All of these characteristics combine to facilitate safe
launch, recovery and efficient cruise performance. The following speeds are provided based on actual GeoStar flight testing and data
logged by telemetry and onboard airspeed instrumentation. Speeds were measured at the maximum weight of 25lbs:

a. Maximum speed, level flight:  65mph
b. Stall Speed Clean:            24mph
c. Stall Speed Max Flaps:        21mph
d. Cruise/Photo collect speed:   40-45mph
e. Power-off glide speed:        40mph
f. Best rate of climb speed:     40mph

GeoStar sUAS Description and Operational Capabilities

General: The GeoStar sUAS is designed as a semi-autonomous precision aerial photography system. The entire system is
transported to the collection area in a modified trailer. The GeoStar UAV launches and recovers at or near each desired collection
area. A two or three person crew of UAV Pilot, Telemetry Operator and (optionally) one Observer operate the GeoStar sUAS. The
GeoStar UAV is launched like a conventional aircraft by manual pilot control, similar to a standard radio controlled airplane. It
requires a takeoff run of about 20-50 feet, depending on weight, wind conditions and runway surface. Once safely airborne, an
autopilot is enabled and the UAV flies autonomously along a pre-programmed route of parallel tracks, holding a steady speed and
altitude. When flying autonomously via autopilot control, it remains continuously connected to a Ground Control Station via two
independent command and control links. The system is designed around collections of up to 1 square statute mile. Flying at a cruise
speed of 40mph, one square mile of terrain can be collected in about 20 minutes. A high-resolution digital camera is installed to
capture a series of still photographs. The camera is aimed straight down and is commanded to shoot at timed intervals. To comply
with FAR 91.119 as prescribed in COA 2014-CSA-35, most missions are flown at an altitude of 500-600 feet above the ground. Upon
completion of the photo mission, the UAV descends while returning to the launch point and enters an orbit at the initial recovery
altitude of 350 feet AGL. The UAV can then be recovered manually by the pilot on the wheels or with a parachute recovery system.
The parachute also serves as an important emergency backup system to safely recover the UAV in the event of a system malfunction.

Command and Control: The GeoStar UAV is designed to function as a semi-autonomous aircraft with redundant systems for
connectivity and a continuous telemetry interface with a Ground Control Station.

          a. Primary Radio Control (RC). Primary, manual pilot control of the UAV is through a conventional Radio Control (RC)
system. From the RC controller, the UAV Pilot can activate all UAV systems and command the autopilot into different operational
modes. The RC system maintains continuous connectivity with the UAV and immediately overrides any autopilot function. An
external power amplifier and larger antenna extend Primary RC range to approximately 3sm when operating at 300-600 feet AGL

          b. Autopilot Function. The GeoStar UAV autopilot system uses 3 axis gyros, GPS/INS navigation, barometric altimeter,
magnetic compass and pitot/static derived airspeed to perform a variety of automated flight tasks from simple stabilization to fully
autonomous flight and precision navigation. Autopilot navigation and control enables the GeoStar UAV to fly the precise ground
tracks and stable altitudes required for precision aerial survey. Successful autopilot function has been demonstrated in winds aloft
conditions exceeding 20 knots. Altitude holding precision is generally +/- 5 feet and airspeed stability is typically +/- 3mph in level or
turning flight. The autopilot incorporates 5 distinct modes of operation:

          -Manual Mode. No autopilot input to flight controls. All control remains with the UAV Pilot via the handheld RC controller
          and the UAV is flown like a standard RC airplane. The UAV is normally launched in this mode.
          -Stabilize Mode. In this mode, the autopilot maintains "wings level" and seeks to remain in level flight. The UAV Pilot's
          control inputs will maneuver the UAV but upon release of the controls, the UAV returns to level, stabilized flight. Power
          level is manually set by the Pilot.

          -Loiter Mode. When commanded to Loiter Mode, the UAV will establish a left-hand orbit of preset radius and maintain the
          altitude established at the moment Loiter was initialized. A designated airspeed is preset for Loiter mode and maintained
          throughout the Loiter. The GeoStar Loiter radius is preset to 40 meters and airspeed is preset to 40mph.

          -Auto Mode. In this mode, the autopilot steers the aircraft along a route of preset waypoints using 3-axis gyros, GPS/INS
          navigation, barometric altimeter, magnetic compass and pitot/static derived airspeed. It also will seek and/or maintain a
          preset altitude and airspeed. While in Auto mode, the UAV Pilot can intervene and maneuver the aircraft manually at any
          time and/or increase the power setting for a faster airspeed. However, the UAV Pilot cannot command a power setting below
          a preset Auto Mode minimum airspeed setting.

          -Return to Launch-point (RTL) Mode. In this mode, the autopilot steers the aircraft back to the launch point and then loiters
          at a preset altitude, diameter and airspeed. RTL can be preset as the final leg of a mission or commanded manually any time
          the aircraft is within RC range by handheld controller function. RTL can also be commanded via Telemetry Control
          Interface (discussed below). The Autopilot also incorporates a number of safety features that will automatically command
          the aircraft to RTL under certain Lost Link and low-voltage conditions.

          c. Telemetry Module. A separate telemetry module, independently powered and operating on a discrete frequency spectrum,
interfaces with the autopilot. Flight data from the autopilot is broadcast via this module at a rate of 10hz, reporting the aircraft's

current position, flight parameters and systems status in real-time. The data is viewed and flight performance can then be monitored at

the Ground Control Station computer by a dedicated Telemetry Operator. The Telemetry system also provides audible cues and alerts

of autopilot mode changes, waypoint progress, lost link alarms, low voltage alarms and other malfunctions. The UAV Pilot is also

able to monitor the Telemetry display and audio cues on a secondary monitor mounted on the RC Controller. Telemetry range

exceeds 3sm when operating at 500 feet AGL.

The telemetry interface can also command the autopilot independently from the Primary RC controller. Commands such as Return to

Launch-point, Loiter, speed and altitude changes and new waypoints can all be sent via this link. The parachute recovery system can
be activated from this link as well. This "Telemetry Control Interface" (TCI) functionality is an important safety feature, affording a

reliable secondary method of controlling and recovering the UAV in the event of lost or interrupted primary RC control.

          d. Ground Control Station (GCS). AeroLogix sUAS GCS is based in a specially modified trailer. The "Operations Trailer"
is equipped with light and AC power. The trailer provides:

          -A 110volt/3500-watt gasoline powered generator for AC power.
          -Telemetry Operator GCS Computer.
          -UAV Pilot Auxiliary Telemetry Display
          -GCS Telemetry antenna mountings
          -VHF Radios for air traffic communications.
          -GMRS Radios for Communications between UAV Pilot, Observer and Telemetry Operator.
          -Weather station.
          -Battery chargers.
          -Workbench, tools and spare parts for assembly and field repairs.
          -Transport for all GeoStar sUAS components.

GeoStar UAV Power Scheme. The GeoStar UAV is an all-electric design, utilizing rechargeable Lithium-Polymer batteries for all
systems. Unlike many all-electric sUAS that utilize a single battery power source, the GeoStar UAV power scheme isolates the
critical systems into independently powered and regulated circuits.

          a. Main Propulsion Power. The GeoStar UAV can utilize up to four separate "6S" (22.2 VDC) 6000 mAh Lithium-Polymer
battery cells for main propulsion. Cells are connected in parallel to achieve 12,000, 18,000 or 24,000 mAh of capacity. The multiple
battery scheme allows tailoring of capacity to fit the mission profile. The main battery voltage level and current draw is relayed back
to the GCS via telemetry, allowing continuous monitoring of main propulsion motor performance and battery state. GeoStar flight
testing revealed remarkable efficiency and endurance. With a full battery load of 24,000mAh, endurance at normal cruise speeds can
exceed 60 minutes while affording a 15 minute reserve capacity. Specific battery consumption and mission profiles will be discussed
later in this document.

          b. Avionics Power. The Avionics system in the GeoStar UAV is comprised of the Primary RC Receiver, autopilot system,
voltage regulators and system servos. Avionics power is provided by two Lithium-Polymer "2S", 7.4 VDC rechargeable batteries
connected in parallel. The avionics battery voltage level and current draw is relayed back to the GCS via telemetry, allowing
continuous monitoring of battery state. The useful duration of these batteries exceeds 3 hours, insuring positive control and autopilot
function well beyond the endurance of the Main Propulsion Batteries. An autopilot Power Module regulates and conditions power for
the Autopilot and RC Receiver. The servos are powered from a separate power converter and isolated servo power circuit within the
Autopilot. A total of 11 servos are utilized by the GeoStar UAV. Servos are the only likely source of electrical noise or voltage
fluctuations within the avionics power circuits. By isolating the servos to their own regulated power circuit, any anomalies within the
servo circuit will not affect the sensitive autopilot and RC Receiver functions. The avionics battery performance is depicted below
based on telemetry data from a 25-minute mission:

Flight Profile and Endurance. Operating within the constraints of COA 2014-CSA-35 ­ namely operations within visual range -
GeoStar operations in the Fall of 2014 were generally within 1sm of the launch point. The complete load of 4 main propulsion
batteries was not always required to comply with our COA mandated 30 minute reserve requirement of 14 CFR 91.151, (Minimum
Fuel Requirements). Sufficient endurance for shorter test and photo missions was afforded with two or three main propulsion
batteries. Power consumption rates were recorded on all flights and those figures allow accurate estimation of battery consumption.

          For reasons to be discussed later in this application, AeroLogix will be requesting an exemption from the requirements of 14
CFR 91.151. The maximum anticipated flight profile for most missions will be approximately 30 minutes from start to finish.
Envisioned operations will keep the UAV within 1-2sm of the GCS. The following table and graph depict a typical photo mission
collecting 1sq mile and reveal a generous 32% reserve capacity when operating with just two main propulsion batteries. This
represents an available 15 minutes of reserve capacity at cruise power settings. Consumption rates were compiled from actual
GeoStar telemetry feeds when operating at temperatures of 25O-50OF. The "Amp Draw" value during the "Collect" phase is an
average value as the rate varied from 10-20amps at different times during the collections.

GeoStar sUAS Systems Redundancy. In order to achieve maximum safety of operations, another specific design goal of the
GeoStar sUAS was systems redundancy to avoid "single point of failure" scenarios. The following design features of the GeoStar
sUAS were incorporated to maximize reliability and safety of operations:

          a. Aileron Control Servo Redundancy. The GeoStar UAV employs dual ailerons on each wing panel, each actuated by its
own independent servo. In the unlikely event of an aileron servo or linkage malfunction, partial yet positive aileron control remains
on the affected wing panel.

          b. Elevator Control Servo Redundancy. In a similar fashion to the ailerons, each elevator surface is actuated by its own
independent servo. If a single elevator servo or linkage malfunction occurs, sufficient elevator authority is maintained on the other to
safely maneuver and recover the UAV.

          c. Main Propulsion Battery Redundancy. The GeoStar UAV employs from 2 to 4 main propulsion battery cells connected in
parallel. While unlikely, an internal battery or connection failure of one cell will not result in a complete loss of main propulsion
power. In the most likely flight profile scenarios, the remaining cell(s) will provide sufficient power for a return to the launch point
and safe recovery of the UAV. A battery failure will be indicated at the GCS by telemetry data indicating a more rapidly decreasing
battery voltage.

          d. Avionics Battery Redundancy. In a similar fashion to the main propulsion batteries, two avionics batteries are connected
in parallel to power the critical Autopilot and servo circuits. While unlikely, an internal battery or connection failure of one cell will
not result in an immediate loss of avionics power. In the most likely flight profile scenarios, the remaining cell will provide sufficient
avionics power for a return to the launch point and safe recovery of the UAV.

          e. GCS Systems Redundancy. The GeoStar sUAS Ground Control Station (GCS) has a portable electric generator with an
endurance exceeding 12 hours. The critical flight control and communication systems are battery powered with rechargeable
batteries. The generator insures these systems remain on AC power and in a fully charged state as the GeoStar sUAS is operated. In
the event of a generator shutdown, all components revert to their battery power, allowing successful return and recovery of the
GeoStar.

GeoStar sUAS Lost Link/Failsafe Descriptions - General. As described earlier in this application, the GeoStar UAV employs two,
separate Command and Control Links operating on discrete frequencies. Either link system can command the UAV to Return To
Launch-point (RTL) and/or command Parachute Deployment. The complete loss of either link system will command an immediate
and automatic Return To Launch-Point (RTL) mode change within the autopilot. The UAV will autonomously return and then orbit
over the launch point at a safe, predetermined altitude and airspeed. All lost-link conditions are tested and confirmed during GeoStar
UAV preflight actions.

GeoStar sUAS Lost Link/Failsafe Descriptions ­ Primary RC Control Link. The UAV Pilot manually controls the GeoStar UAV
and commands Autopilot modes via the Primary RC Link. The RC Controller remains powered, connected and in the possession of
the UAV Pilot throughout the GeoStar mission profile. If the Primary RC control link is lost at any time, a sequence of events is
automatically triggered:

           a. Short Term Interruption Failsafe ­ Primary RC. When an interruption of the Primary RC link exceeds 1.5 seconds, the
Autopilot commands a "Circle" mode, whereby the UAV begins a circular flight path and holds a steady altitude. Circle radius is
preset to 40 meters. The Telemetry Computer will report visually "FAILSAFE" and audibly announce, "MODE CHANGE TO
CIRCLE" followed by, "NO DATA FOR 10 SECONDS", "NO DATA FOR 15 SECONDS" etc.. If the Primary RC link is
reestablished within 20 seconds, the Autopilot remains in "Circle" mode until the UAV Pilot commands a new Autopilot mode.

          b. Long Term Interruption Failsafe - Primary RC. When an interruption of the Primary RC link exceeds 20 seconds, the
Autopilot will automatically command a Return to Launch-Point" (RTL) mode change. The Telemetry Computer will report visually
"FAILSAFE" and audibly, "NO DATA FOR 20 SECONDS", "MODE CHANGE TO RTL," whereby the UAV immediately begins a
return to the launch point and a descent to the recovery altitude. If the Primary RC link is reestablished after the automatic RTL is
initiated, the Autopilot remains in RTL mode until a new Autopilot mode is commanded by the UAV Pilot.

                                                                                     January 2015
GeoStar sUAS Lost Link/Failsafe Descriptions ­ Telemetry Link. The Telemetry link is continuously monitored during a GeoStar
sUAS mission by a dedicated Telemetry Operator. Link status and signal strength is reported in the main Telemetry Display. The
"%" value represents the percentage of good data packets received via the Telemetry link. The signal strength is indicated by 1-3
vertical bars.

                                                                Telemetry Connection Status
          a. Lost Telemetry Link Indications. Momentary losses of Telemetry Link are seen on the Telemetry display as loss of signal
strength and/or a decrease in the percentage value of data packets. When a continuous loss exceeds 5 seconds, the program announces
"NO DATA FOR 5 SECONDS," "NO DATA FOR 10 SECONDS" etc... A complete loss of telemetry data is indicated by a
"Failsafe" indication and a red " X " in the telemetry status area of the Telemetry Display.

          b. Lost Telemetry Link Failsafe. The GeoStar UAV Autopilot is programmed to trigger an automatic Failsafe RTL if
Telemetry loss exceeds 20 continuous seconds. The Autopilot will command RTL, whereby the UAV immediately begins a return to
the launch point and a descent to the recovery altitude. The Telemetry Computer will announce, ""NO DATA FOR 20 SECONDS."
It will continue to make "NO DATA" announcements at 10 second intervals until the Data Link is restored or until silenced by the
Telemetry Operator. The Telemetry Computer will continue to visually report "FAILSAFE." With a complete loss of Telemetry data,
the mode change to RTL can only be evidenced visually by the UAV Pilot and/or the Observer. If the Telemetry Link is reestablished
after the automatic RTL is initiated, the Autopilot remains in RTL mode until a new Autopilot mode is commanded by the UAV Pilot.

                  24  January 2015
GeoStar sUAS Lost Link/Failsafe Descriptions ­ Simultaneous Primary RC and Telemetry Links Lost. To mitigate the risk of
this scenario, Command and Control links to the GeoStar UAV are independently powered, both in the UAV itself and at the GCS.
The independent batteries powering the UAV Telemetry and Avionics have a useful duration that greatly exceeds the battery life of
the Main Propulsion System. While unlikely, the possibility exists for both Command and Control links to malfunction. Two
possible scenarios exist in this case. Outcomes and actions depend on the functionality of the UAV autopilot. If the GeoStar retains a
functioning autopilot, RTL will be commanded upon loss of either link and the aircraft will return and orbit over the launch point at a
predetermined altitude.

           a. Simultaneous Primary RC and Telemetry Links Lost ­ Autopilot Functional. A functional Autopilot affords options in
dealing with a complete Command and Control Link loss. As discussed earlier, a loss of either link will trigger an automatic RTL and
loiter over the launch point at a safe, pre-determined altitude. This affords time to troubleshoot each system and ideally perform an
immediate Parachute Recovery. If contact cannot be regained, the UAV will orbit at the launch site until Main Propulsion batteries
are exhausted. As the main propulsion battery voltage diminishes, a slow circling descent at approximately 40mph will occur at the
launch point until ground impact. Since the autopilot/avionics circuit is independently powered, the autopilot will continue to
command a 40 meter orbit radius throughout this descent.

          b. Simultaneous Primary RC and Telemetry Links Lost ­ No Autopilot Functional. While extremely unlikely, this scenario
represents the "worst case" scenario to an airborne GeoStar UAV. All Failsafe parameters are stored in the Autopilot and a
malfunction of this system could disable Failsafe logic and control performance. A complete loss of Primary RC and Telemetry links
as well as autopilot functions and failsafe modes will likely result in uncontrolled/uncommanded flight. UAV actions depend on the
nature of the autopilot malfunctions and the resulting inputs to the flight control servos. If the UAV fails to RTL, fails to respond to
control inputs or mode changes from either Command and Control link, the UAV Pilot and crew have few options. If the UAV
remains in stable flight despite complete loss of both links and Autopilot, troubleshooting at the GCS shall be attempted to regain
Command and Control. The long connectivity ranges afforded by both the Primary RC and Telemetry Link help in this regard. If the
UAV continues to fly away in stable flight, it could potentially do so until the Main Propulsion batteries are exhausted. In a clean
configuration and neutral flight control surfaces, an unpowered gliding descent at approximately 40mph and 100-500fpm will occur
until ground impact.

GeoStar sUAS Lost Link/Failsafe Descriptions ­ Low Voltage Failsafes. The GeoStar UAV autopilot system is capable of
monitoring the voltage and current levels of the avionics circuit. With the avionics circuit batteries having over a much longer
duration than main propulsion batteries, the likelihood of an avionics low-voltage scenario is remote. The failsafe remains a useful
tool in the event of a battery malfunction. Low voltage conditions in this circuit will trigger one of two automated failsafe responses
to maintain UAV functionality and effect a safe recovery.

a) 1st Low Voltage Threshold. When avionics voltage drops below 7.0 volts, an audible alarm announces
                                                  "WARNING - LOW VOLTAGE"

b) 2nd Low Voltage Threshold. When avionics voltage drops below 6.8 volts, automatic RTL is initiated.

GeoStar sUAS General Operating Parameters

Proximity to Airports: Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, AeroLogix is not allowed to operate the GeoStar
sUAS within 2nm of the public airports in or near Le Sueur County. We are allowed to operate within the Class E surface area near
the uncontrolled Mankato airport (KMKT) provided we remain outside of 2nm and monitor the CTAF frequency. We are required to
terminate the flight/exit the KMKT Class E Surface Area when aircraft broadcast intentions to depart or land on certain runways.
These limitations have not significantly impacted operations. AeroLogix requests the same authorizations for uncontrolled airport
proximity as previously granted in COA 2014-CSA-35.

          With potential commercial operations in many different areas, AeroLogix recognizes the need for greater planning and
coordination when operations are desired near or within controlled airports and airspace. AeroLogix anticipates additional
requirements/limitations in this regard with a 333 exemption. We request consideration and authorization of GeoStar sUAS
operations in Class D and C airspace provided prior coordination and approval with appropriate ATC is conducted and postive
communications can be assured.

Operations within Mode C Veils: Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, AeroLogix is authorized to operate the
GeoStar sUAS in a portion of the MSP Mode C veil without a transponder, provided operations remain in Class G airspace and prior
coordination with Minneapolis Approach ATC is performed. The dual command and control systems were deemed appropriate
mitigation for the requirements of 14 CFR 91.215. As COA 2014-CSA-35 states:

"The GeoStar separate Command and Control links and ATC approval are acceptable mitigations for 14 CFR 91.215 requirements in
the absence of a Mode C transponder."
AeroLogix requests the same authorizations for operations within Mode C veils as previously granted in COA 2014-CSA-35.

Proximity to Densely Populated Areas: Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, AeroLogix is not allowed to operate
the GeoStar sUAS over densely populated areas. These are generally depicted on FAA Sectional and Terminal Area Charts in yellow.
AeroLogix is not seeking authorization to operate over densely populated areas and only requests the same authorizations previously
granted in COA 2014-CSA-35.

Weather Minimums: Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, AeroLogix operates the GeoStar UAV in day VMC
conditions with at least 3sm of visibility and a ceiling no lower than 1000'AGL. The following conditions were prescribed.
Unless otherwise authorized as a special provision, all operations must be conducted in visual meteorological conditions (VMC)
during daylight hours in compliance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 §91.155 and the following:
...Special Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations are not authorized.
...VFR cloud clearances specified in 14 CFR Part 91 §91.155, must be maintained, except in Class G airspace where Class E
airspace visibility requirements must be applied, but not less than 3 statute miles (SM) flight visibility and 1000' ceiling.
...Night operations are prohibited unless otherwise authorized as a special provision.

AeroLogix requests the same authorizations for operational weather minimums as previously granted in COA 2014-CSA-35.

ACI_20150114_333

                  26  January 2015
Operations within Visual Line Of Sight: Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, GeoStar sUAS operations must
remain in visual contact with the UAV Pilot or up to one qualified observer. The Observer must remain in constant radio contact with
the UAV Pilot and Telemetry Operator whenever the GeoStar flies beyond the visual range of the UAV Pilot. No "daisy-chains" of
observers are allowed. AeroLogix does not seek operations with multiple observer "daisy chains" or any operations beyond visual
range. AeroLogix only requests the same authorizations as previously granted in COA 2014-CSA-35.

          Compared to many sUASs, the GeoStar is a much larger aircraft (13' wingspan) and has a distinctive shape and coloring to
facilitate visual contact. Flight testing the GeoStar UAV at altitudes of 300-550 feet AGL revealed visual contact can be maintained
to approximately 1sm with the unaided eye.

GeoStar sUAS ­ Operational Scenarios

Operational Scenarios ­ General: Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, GeoStar sUAS operations are limited to a
maximum altitude of 600 feet AGL while also being required to comply with 14 CFR 91.119 (Minimum Safe Altitudes) ­ requiring a
500 foot clearance from objects or persons on the ground. As a result, the current GeoStar imaging system is optimized for collections
in the 500-600 foot AGL range. Flight operations in 2014 revealed this to be a practical altitude block for the GeoStar sUAS.
AeroLogix does not seek exemption from 14 CFR 91.119 or operational altitudes higher than 600 feet. We only request the same
altitude authorizations previously granted in COA 2014-CSA-35. AeroLogix anticipates three types of collection scenarios with the
GeoStar sUAS.

          -Area Survey
          -Road/Utility Survey
          -Irregular Route Survey

Operational Scenario ­ Area Survey: Area surveys are usually flown with a series of parallel tracks. Track spacing is

determined by desired imagery parameters. Operating between 500 and 600 feet AGL with the standard imaging configuration, the
GeoStar sUAS can map an area of one square mile in approximately 20-25 minutes. While the GeoStar UAV is capable of flying and
collecting much larger areas, additional operational and technical factors come into play that make larger areas less practical.
AeroLogix intends to scale each area collection flight to one square mile or less. When conditions dictate a flight path beyond visual
range of the UAV Pilot, AeroLogix will post a qualified observer. A standard 1sq mile area collection is depicted below:

sUAS. The GeoStar sUAS can create survey grade imagery and engineering products on short notice and at a significant cost savings
to public and private organizations. AeroLogix intends to collect these surveys in segments of up to 2sm, generally flying 3 parallel
tracks. Limiting the segments to 2sm or less insures the UAV remains within visual range of the UAV Pilot and up to one observer. It
also affords a generous excess of connectivity ranges. Flying 3 parallel tracks, a linear 2-mile segment can be collected in
approximately 12-15 minutes. A typical 2sm road survey is depicted below:

Operational Scenario ­ Irregular Route Survey: Many anticipated collections will involve irregular flight paths in order to
accurately survey non-linear agricultural ditches, rivers, streams and roads. Most collections will involve closely spaced parallel
tracks along the path, collecting overlapping photos on both tracks. AeroLogix intends for the GeoStar to remain within 2sm of the
launch point, to insure the UAV remains within visual range of the UAV Pilot and up to one observer. It also affords a generous
excess of connectivity ranges. Depending on route geometry, most collections will be completed in 15-20 minutes. The route depicted
below can be collected in approximately 15 minutes, including time for launch, climb and recovery.

    SECTION III - SPECIFIC CFR EXEMPTION REQUESTS & SUPPORTING EXPLANATIONS

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates
14 CFR § 91.203(a)(1) Certifications Required

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H, establishes the requirements for the issuance of airworthiness certificates;
14 CFR 91.203(a)(1) establishes the requirement for all civil aircraft to have a Certificate of Airworthiness

Explanation Supporting Exemption
The FAA publication, "Public Guidance for Petitions for Exemption Filed under Section 333" Rev. 9/25/2014, states:

Section 333 of the Reform Act grants the Secretary of Transportation authority to determine:

1. If an unmanned aircraft system, as a result of its size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and
populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight does not create a hazard to users of the national airspace
system or the public or pose a threat to national security; and

2. Whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness certification under 49 USC § 44704, is
required for the operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1).

         AeroLogix respectfully submits that airworthiness certification under Part 21 is not required for safe operation of
the GeoStar sUAS in the NAS. Operating under the provisions of COA 2014-CSA-35, GeoStar sUAS flight operations
were authorized by the FAA without an Airworthiness Certificate. Le Sueur County was allowed to certify GeoStar
UAV airworthiness as a public aircraft and to dispatch AeroLogix and the GeoStar sUAS on aerial survey missions
throughout most of the county. AeroLogix and Le Sueur County worked jointly to develop and document the procedures
for safe operation and continued airworthiness of the GeoStar sUAS. This documentation is provided with our
application. With successful flight operations and smooth integration into the NAS in 2014, AeroLogix has successfully
demonstrated its competence in designing, constructing, maintaining and operating the GeoStar sUAS in the NAS.

         The GeoStar UAV has proven to be an airworthy, safe and reliable sUAS aircraft. The size, weight and speed
parameters were described earlier in detail along with a full description of innovative design features that enhance safety.
While meeting the FAA criteria for sUAS systems, the GeoStar sUAS design surpasses many current sUAS systems in
safety and redundancy features.

         From an operational perspective, AeroLogix intends to operate the identical GeoStar sUAS system under similar
operational and airspace conditions as previously vetted and approved by the FAA in COA 2014-CSA-35. AeroLogix
intends short duration flights in rural, sparsely populated areas, within visual range and in compliance with 14 CFR
91.119. All GeoStar operations will be conducted by a certificated Private Pilot or FAA prescribed alternative
qualification.

ACI_20150114_333

                  31  January 2015
         Collectively, we believe these factors combine to fulfill the conditions expressed in Section 333 and merit worthy
consideration for exemption as expressed in the Reform Act. We assert that by design, operational intent and by
successful NAS integration already demonstrated in 2014, that the GeoStar sUAS will achieve equivalent or greater levels
of safety as those demonstrated by conventional providers of Aerial Survey.

         The first GeoStar sUAS airframe was required to be registered with the FAA and an application was submitted in
December 2014. Approval and assignment of a registration "N" number is pending approval as of this writing.
AeroLogix will be registering all subsequent GeoStar airframes as they are completed.

         Due to the aircraft size, it is not possible to comply with the size and location requirements expressed above. A
request for an alternate form of compliance was filed with AFS-86, UAS Airworthiness Section and has been approved.
The approved alternative involves 4-inch letters affixed to upper and lower wing surfaces and 1-inch letters on either side
of the vertical stabilizer/rudder. AeroLogix respectfully requests that subsequent GeoStar UAV airframes be authorized
marking in accordance with the approved alternative marking scheme for the first GeoStar airframe.

Explanation Supporting Exemption

         AeroLogix respectfully seeks exemption to allow the Pilot in Command of the GeoStar sUAS to conduct
commercial sUAS operations with a Private Pilot Certificate or FAA authorized alternative. GeoStar sUAS flight
operations under COA 2014-CSA-35 prescribed a minimum acceptable Pilot in Command (PIC) as:

...The PIC must hold, at a minimum, a current FAA private pilot certificate or the FAA accepted agency equivalent, based
on the application or 14 CFR Part 61.under all operations:

         (1) Approved for flight in Class A, B, C, D, E, and G (more than 400 feet above ground level (AGL))
         airspace
...Operations without a pilot certificate may be allowed when all of the following conditions are met:
         (1) The PIC has successfully completed, at a minimum, FAA private pilot ground instruction and passed the
         written examination, or the FAA accepted agency equivalent, based on the application.

         AeroLogix intends to operate the identical GeoStar sUAS system under similar operational and airspace
conditions as previously vetted and approved by the FAA in COA 2014-CSA-35. We respectfully request the same
authorizations with regards to Pilot qualifications. AeroLogix recognizes that UAS operational safety is greatly enhanced
by the knowledge and experience that come with a Pilot certificate and recent flying experience of conventional aircraft in
the NAS.

14 CFR § 91.7 (a) Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

14 CFR 91.7 (a)   States that no person may operate a Civil Aircraft unless it is in an airworthy
                  condition.

Explanations Supporting Exemption
         AeroLogix respectfully seeks exemption from 14 CFR 91.7 (a) due to civil aircraft "airworthiness" generally

being defined by the conditions that support the granting of an Airworthiness Certificate in compliance with 14 CFR Part
21. AeroLogix is seeking exemption from the requirements of 14 CFR Part 21 and thus cannot comply with the definition
of airworthiness as defined by that Part.

         AeroLogix intends full compliance with 14 CFR 91.7 (b) that prescribes a more general definition with the Pilot
in Command as being responsible for determining:

         ...whether that aircraft is in condition for safe flight. The pilot in command shall discontinue the flight when
unairworthy mechanical, electrical, or structural conditions occur.

The Pilot in Command assembles the GeoStar UAV at the launch site and performs all preflight assembly and inspection
in accordance with the procedures set forth in GeoStar sUAS Operations Manual. This manual is submitted for FAA
reference with this application.

14 CFR § 91.9 (b)(2) Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft

         14 CFR 91.9 (b)(2) (regarding flight manuals)..."is available in the aircraft a current
                                    approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material,
                                    markings, and placards, or any combination thereof."

Explanation Supporting Exemption
         AeroLogix respectfully seeks exemption from 14 CFR 91.9 (b)(2) due to the size and nature of the sUAS and

Pilot access to such manuals. AeroLogix submits an equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping the GeoStar
UAV Operations Manual at the Ground Control Station.

14 CFR § 91.109(a) Flight Instruction

         14 CFR 91.109(a) Requires flight instruction be conducted in aircraft with fully functioning dual controls.

Explanation Supporting Exemption
         AeroLogix respectfully submits that the GeoStar sUAS is not capable of compliance with this regulation due to

the unmanned, remotely piloted nature of its design. Any flight instruction performed with a prospective UAV Pilot shall
be conducted with a secondary RC Controller ("buddy box") wired to the Primary RC Controller. The "buddy box"
allows the Instructor Pilot to transfer control to the Trainee Pilot's RC controller via a positive push-button switch. If the
Instructor Pilot is required to resume control, he simply releases the switch and control is instantly transferred back to the
Primary RC Controller and the Instructor Pilot. AeroLogix submits that an equivalent level of safety is achieved with this
arrangement as are dual controls in a conventional aircraft.

14 CFR § 91.121 Altimeter Settings

14 CFR 91.121(a)  Establishes requirements for barometric altimeter settings when operating below 18,000
                  feet MSL

Explanation Supporting Exemption

         AeroLogix respectfully seeks exemption from 14 CFR 91.121 (a). The GeoStar UAV autopilot system has an
internal barometric sensing altimeter that does not incorporate a means to manually adjust for pressure variation. Each
time the autopilot initializes, the altimeter automatically calibrates and establishes the initialization altitude as zero (0) feet
AGL. All altitudes referenced and used by the autopilot are in AGL values. GPS altitudes are available as a secondary
altitude reference in the event of a barometric altimeter failure. Failsafe logic automatically reverts to GPS altitudes in the
event of a barometric altimeter failure. AeroLogix submits that an equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the
automated altimeter calibration and GPS failsafe logic.

         14 CFR 91.151(a)(1,2) (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
(considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and,
assuming normal cruising speed--

                   (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes;

Explanations Supporting Exemption

         While the GeoStar UAV is capable of complying with this regulation for many projected mission profiles,
AeroLogix respectfully requests exemption from the requirements of 91.151 for GeoStar sUAS. Compliance with this
regulation requires loading of additional batteries and increases the weight of the GeoStar UAV. While performance is
satisfactory at the maximum weight of 25 lbs., a shorter reserve requirement would allow fewer batteries and lighter
weights for shorter mission profiles. This would allow greater efficiency, shorter takeoff and landing runs, less stressful
parachute recoveries and better management of battery packs in the field. Operating with the 12,000 mAh "twin pack,"
most projected mission profiles can be launched, flown and recovered while maintaining a 15 minute reserve capacity.
GeoStar flight operations in 2014 demonstrated that 15 minutes would be an adequate reserve capacity based on the
following criteria:

         1) Proximity to launch and recovery location. The GeoStar UAV launches and recovers from the same location.
Maximum ranges shall not exceed approximately 2sm for most projected operations. At cruising speed, the GeoStar
requires only 2-3 minutes of flight time to return to the launch/recovery location.

         2) Short Duration Flights. 91.151 contemplates a pilot/passenger-carrying flight to a destination airfield in VFR
conditions. The prescribed reserve affords a limited measure of dealing with slower-than-projected groundspeeds en route
or delays getting into the arrival airport. These issues are generally not a consideration for the GeoStar sUAS as it
operates for relatively short periods of time and within a very short distance of the launch/recovery point.

         3) Excess Reserve Capacity Aggravates "Lost Link/Flyaway" Scenarios. While extremely unlikely to occur, the
possibility exists for a malfunction to cause uncommanded flight for the duration of the main propulsion batteries. 30+
minutes of reserve capacity could compound the issues faced in this scenario by potentially causing the UAV to fly away
farther and higher. 15 minutes of reserve capacity is sufficient to perform all GeoStar sUAS lost-link troubleshooting
procedures and would limit the maximum range attainable in a flyaway scenario.

ACI_20150114_333

                  37  January 2015
         4) Independent Power Circuits for Avionics, Telemetry and Main Propulsion. The GeoStar sUAS telemetry and
avionics circuits are not dependent on the main propulsion batteries for their endurance and reserve capacity. These
batteries will continue to control gliding flight and/or command parachute deployment for 2-2.5 hours beyond the main
propulsion batteries' maximum endurance.

         5) Telemetry data for real-time status of the main propulsion batteries. The main propulsion battery voltage level
and current flow is fed to the GCS via telemetry link. The UAV Pilot is able to monitor this data in real time and assess
battery condition and motor performance as a mission progresses.

         6) Projected Flight Profiles and Battery Loads. A 15 minute reserve allows much better loading flexibility for the
GeoStar sUAS. While most anticipated missions will be flown in less than 30 minutes, the GeoStar imaging system can
be fitted with a variety of lenses that deliver imaging "footprints" of different sizes. Capturing very high-resolution
images with smaller footprints can require longer flight times to capture an equivalent area. Flight profiles for the
different battery configurations are depicted in the tables and graphs below. The "Amp Draw" value during the "Collect"
phase is an average value. The actual rate varies as the battery voltage diminishes over time and as the autopilot manages
the power level during the collections. Rates are based on actual GeoStar telemetry feeds when operating at temperatures
of 250-500 F.

         6) Summary. Since the first GeoStar test flight, the compiling of battery consumption and performance data has
been a primary objective. AeroLogix can now accurately predict the endurance for the various battery configurations and
monitor performance in real time against this data. AeroLogix respectfully submits that when consideration is given to
the GeoStar sUAS operational parameters, systems redundancy, telemetry data feeds and the improved flight performance
gained by flexible loading options, an equivalent level of safety can be achieved with 15 minutes of reserve capacity for
main propulsion batteries.

                                       approved, automatic ELT.

Explanations Supporting Exemption
         AeroLogix respectfully seeks exemption from 14 CFR 91.207 (a)(1). The size and weights of available ELT

systems preclude their installation into the GeoStar UAV. AeroLogix submits that an equivalent level of safety to an ELT
system is achieved with the real-time telemetry feed of the UAV's position and operations within visual range.

14 CFR § 91.307 (a) Parachutes and Parachuting

14 CFR 91.307 (a)  Establishes: No pilot of a civil aircraft may allow a parachute that is available for

                   emergency use to be carried in that aircraft unless it is an approved type and has been
                   packed by a certificated and appropriately rated parachute rigger--.

Explanations Supporting Exemption
         The AeroLogix GeoStar UAV utilizes a 12' or 14' parachute for use in both normal and emergency recoveries.

The parachute is of a very lightweight design and synthetic material originally used in amateur rocketry. "Approved
Type" parachutes for use by human parachutists are not of a practical size or weight to be compatible with the GeoStar

UAV. AeroLogix submits that this regulation is not applicable to the GeoStar sUAS and respectfully seeks exemption.

14 CFR Subpart E Establishes maintenance requirements for US-Registered Civil Aircraft.

Explanations Supporting Exemption

         The regulations cited above prescribe maintenance requirements and recordkeeping for aircraft maintained in
accordance with Part 43. Aircraft of this type are those that have an Airworthiness Certificate and have met the
requirements for certification under 14 CFR 21 Part H. The AeroLogix GeoStar sUAS is seeking exemption from the
requirements of an Airworthiness Certificate. If granted, the exemption will nullify the requirements cited above.

         GeoStar sUAS flight operations under COA 2014-CSA-35 prescribe maintenance and maintenance record
keeping in the following manner:

"...Software and hardware changes should be documented as part of the normal maintenance procedures. Software
changes to the aircraft and control station as well as hardware system changes are classified as major changes unless the
agency has a formal process, accepted by the FAA. These changes should be provided to the UAS Integration office in
summary form at the time of incorporation."

"...All previously flight proven systems to include payloads, may be installed or removed as required, and that activity
recorded in the unmanned aircraft and ground control stations logbooks by persons authorized to conduct UAS
maintenance Describe any payload equipment configurations in the UAS logbook that will result in a weight and balance
change, electrical loads, and or flight dynamics, unless the agency has a formal process, accepted by the FAA."

"...For unmanned aircraft system discrepancies, a record entry should be made by an appropriately rated person to
document the finding in the logbook. No flights may be conducted following major changes, modifications or new
installations unless the party responsible for certifying airworthiness has determined the system is safe to operate in the
NAS and a new AWR is generated, unless the agency has a formal process, accepted by the FAA. The successful
completion of these tests must be recorded in the appropriate logbook, unless the agency has a formal process, accepted
by the FAA."

AeroLogix intends to operate the identical GeoStar sUAS system under similar operational and airspace conditions as
previously vetted and approved by the FAA in COA 2014-CSA-35. We respectfully request the same authorizations with
regards to UAV Maintenance. AeroLogix is the original designer and builder of the GeoStar UAV and intimately familiar
with its construction and maintenance. All GeoStar maintenance will be performed by AeroLogix personnel.

                                       SECTION IV- SUMMARY STATEMENTS

Equivalent Safety
         The Congressional mandate in Section 333 of the Reform Act allows a limited introduction of commercial

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) into the national airspace system in advance of permanent rulemaking, if it can be
accomplished safely. As summarized in this document, AeroLogix has designed the GeoStar sUAS with a set of
innovative safety features and a focus on systems redundancy that few sUASs can match. AeroLogix seeks to maximize
the overall safety potential of a fixed-wing sUAS by both technical achievement and operational professionalism. We
respectfully petition the FAA to consider AeroLogix and the GeoStar sUAS as a professional sUAS operation, previously
vetted via the public-use COA process and having already demonstrated safe integration of GeoStar sUAS operations into
the National Airspace System in 2014. The FAA and general public can have confidence that the operations will achieve
an equivalent or greater level of safety as that demonstrated by conventional aerial survey providers.

Public Benefit
         The AeroLogix GeoStar sUAS concept began as means to economically serve the aerial survey needs of a rural,

southern Minnesota county. On-demand aerial survey by conventional means is a costly undertaking and beyond the
economic reach of many public and private entities. The success of the GeoStar sUAS quickly demonstrated that high-
resolution GIS imagery and survey grade modeling products were now affordable thanks to the innovations and cost
savings derived from using a UAS. The GeoStar sUAS can deliver small scale collections, specifically tailored to each
project or need and at an affordable cost. In many cases, these benefits were simply not attainable until now. As
highlighted earlier, many publicly funded users of conventional aerial survey services were immediately interested in the
cost benefit and operational flexibility demonstrated by the AeroLogix GeoStar sUAS. The following public entities have
expressed interest and/or directly requested GeoStar sUAS services:

         -US Department of Agriculture/University of Minnesota clover crop research project.
         -US Fish and Wildlife Service
         -Minnesota Department of Transportation (3 projects)
         -Minnesota Department of Soil and Water
         -Scott County, Ravine Survey
         -Dakota County, Vermillion River Survey
         -Minnesota State University Mankato, GIS Department
         -University of Minnesota, Aerospace Engineering Dept., Graduate Student Mentorship Program.

A Section 333 exemption would allow much greater flexibility to service these and other publicly funded users of aerial
survey services. The economic benefit potential to the public is significant.

ACI_20150114_333

                  44  January 2015
         From an environmental standpoint, the GeoStar sUAS provides numerous benefits over conventional providers of
aerial survey. Being electric powered, the GeoStar UAV is nearly silent when flying at normal collection altitudes. It also
operates at a higher altitude than many other sUAS systems that seek similar approval for aerial imaging. Once airborne,
it is difficult to distinguish the GeoStar UAV from a conventional aircraft. It does not have the menacing presence of
many sUASs but rather displays a graceful, soaring character in flight. These features combine to make it unobtrusive to
residents, livestock and wildlife in the rural areas contemplated for operations. The GeoStar sUAS utilizes only a small
gasoline-powered generator in the field for power. Burning small amounts of unleaded gasoline, the volume of pollutants
is significantly less than that of a conventional aircraft burning leaded gasoline or jet fuel. With electric power, the
GeoStar will never deposit pollutants on lakes, farmland or natural areas.

         Natural disaster response is another useful public application of the GeoStar sUAS. In the spring and early
summer, many areas of southern Minnesota and the Minnesota River valley face flooding due to extreme winter
snowfalls. Tornados and other severe weather conditions strike without warning, causing wide-spread devastation. In
situations like these, the GeoStar sUAS can be rapidly dispatched to rapidly produce imagery and terrain modeling
products to support critical public agency response to such disasters.

         AeroLogix submits that many aspects of the GeoStar sUAS are of significant public benefit. A Section 333
exemption will create the opportunity for many more public entities to enjoy the benefits of affordable and efficient aerial
survey.
