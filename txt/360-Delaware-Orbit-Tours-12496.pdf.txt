                                                           Exemption No. 12496
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0705

Mr. Anthony Pastoriza
360 Delaware Orbit Tours
192 Fieldbrook Lane
Magnolia, DE 19962

Dear Mr. Pastoriza:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters dated March 16, 2015, and July 13, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of 360 Delaware Orbit Tours (hereinafter petitioner or
operator) for an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct aerial inspection, photography, filmmaking, cinematography, videography,
precision agriculture, wildlife and forestry monitoring and mosquito and insect control, aerial
surveying, public entity support operations, training1, special events, motion picture
production, surface mining, closed set filming,.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

1 The petitioner requested authority to conduct UAS training. At this time, the FAA is unable to authorize UAS
operations for training until a further assessment is completed. When the FAA completes its review, we will
proceed accordingly and no further action will be required by the petitioner. However, the petitioner is permitted
to train its own pilot in commands and visual observers in accordance with condition no. 14 and the other
conditions and limitations in this exemption.
                                                                                                2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire 1,
DJI Spreading Wings S800, DJI Spreading Wings S900, DJI Spreading Wings S1000, DJI
Matrix 100, Cinestar 8 Octo, Altavian Nova F6500, Blade 350 QX3, AgEagle, 3DRobotics
X8, 3DRobotics Iris, 3DRobotics Solo, SenseFly eBee, Yuneec Q500 Typhon, DraganFlyer
X4-ES, Trimble UX5, Microdrones MD4.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection2 and closed set motion picture and
filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described
by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

2 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                3

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, 360 Delaware Orbit Tours is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection and closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to the
conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, 360 Delaware Orbit Tours is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
    DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire 1, DJI Spreading Wings S800, DJI Spreading Wings
    S900, DJI Spreading Wings S1000, DJI Matrix 100, Cinestar 8 Octo, Altavian Nova
    F6500, Blade 350 QX3, AgEagle, 3DRobotics X8, 3DRobotics Iris, 3DRobotics Solo,
    SenseFly eBee, Yuneec Q500 Typhon, DraganFlyer X4-ES, Trimble UX5,
    Microdrones MD4 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming
    are permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.
                                                                                                            4

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.
                                                                                              5

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a

    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
                                                                                         6

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.
                                                                                               7

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be

    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions

    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;

This exemption application is submitted to fulfill Congress' express goal in passing
Sections 333(a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of
Transportation to consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may
operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the
rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this
determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of UASs do not

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue
exemptions.This statutoryauthority,byitsterms,includesexemptingcivilaircraft,
as the term is defined under §40101 of the Act: The Administrator may grant an
exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or

360 Delaware Orbit Tours in filing this application is requesting that the FAA
combine the grant of the Section 333 exemption with a standard Certificate of
Operation (COA) that will allow commercial operations of its 360 Delaware Orbit
Tours' sUAV without the necessity of filing for a COA for each flight, unless such

permission, and the Operator has made a safety assessment of the risk from such
operations.

Operator Requirements

Given the sUAV proposed by 360 Delaware Orbit Tours, Operators should not be
requiredto holda private pilot license. 360DelawareOrbit Tours believesthat 1)
theoperator,insteadofunderstandinghow tooperateapassengercarryingaircraft,
should have knowledge and experience that enables the safe operation of a small,
remotely piloted sUAV should understand airspace restrictions and know how to
ensureseparation fromotheraircraft aswell asnon-participants and property;2)
the sUAV has built-in technical capabilities that limit the potential for unsafe
operation and 3) there are other security screening mechanisms already in
existence that 360 Delaware Orbit Tours will utilize to ensure the operators are
actingconsistentlywithnationalsecurityinterests.

GiventhesUAV safetyfeaturesoutlinedbelow,360DelawareOrbitTours proposes
that its operationsunderthisExemption requestshouldnot be requiredto hold a
commercialorprivate pilotcertification.Instead,Operatorsshouldberequiredto:
have successfully completed, at a minimum, FAA private pilot ground instruction
and passed the FAA Private Pilot written examination or FAA-recognized
equivalents; have completed 360 Delaware Orbit Tours' training program for
operationoftheUAS.

360 Delaware Orbit Tours notes that 1) the FAA has found that safety factors
permitted operation of sUAV's by Operators with these qualifications in the case of
operations pursuant to public COAs when the mandatory operating conditions
specified above were present; and 2) that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
entitled Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 80 F.R.
9544(February23,2015)("NPRM"),doesnotrequiretheoperatortoholda private
pilotlicenseorathirdclassmedical.

See Federal Aviation Administration, Notice N-8900.227, Unmanned Aircraft
Systems (UAS) Operational Approval, at 20-21 (July 30, 2013); As the FAA has
determinedinExemptions11062thru11067,11080and11110(the "Exemptions"),
in comparing the requirements for private pilot knowledge and the knowledge
required for a commercial pilot, that knowledge associated with a private pilot
license, and therefore private pilot ground school, was sufficient to allow private
pilotstooperatesUAV's underthoseexemptions.

Baseduponthatanalysis,360DelawareOrbitTours believessuccessful completion
of FAA private pilot ground school is a suitable predicate to operating the sUAV
under this exemption. 360 Delaware Orbit Tours proposes that the Operator
accumulate required sUAV flight training hours through the operation of sUAV's
ratherthanflighthoursinconventionalaircraft.Those hoursaremorerelevantto

line of sight. The requirements of Part 61.127 (commercial flight proficiency) and
§61.107 (private flight proficiency), to the extent they are relevant to UAS
operations, can be taught in the training proposed herein. As a review of the
requirements of part 61.127 and 107 demonstrate, the issues presented as they
relate to a 55 pound aircraft, operating at less than 30 mph during filming
operations are those taught in ground school and in flight training with the
particular UAS and not gained from accumulating flight hours in a fixed wing or
rotorcraft gas or jet A powered aircraft completing cross country flights and take

As to national security review of pilots, each of 360 Delaware Orbit Tours'
pilots/operators will obtain internally provided certified training (Ground and
Practical) from 360 Delaware Orbit Tours to operate the sUAV. This review and
certification could reasonably vetthe Operatorsagainst any known terroristorno
flylistingsthatarerelevant andpublicallyavailable.

360 Delaware Orbit Tours additionally asks that the exemption be issued without
the requirement for a visual observer. As set forth herein, an equivalent level of

authoritycontainedinthe FederalAviationAct,asamended;thestrongequivalent
level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and the significant public
benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental impacts, including
reduced emissions associated with allowing battery powered sUAV's for these

boundaries. All flights are pre-programmed with precision GPS guidance.. In the
case of unplanned events, the Operator may input pre-programmed evasive
maneuvers from the control unit, and the onboard autopilot executes those
maneuvers. Pre-programmedOperatorinterventionsincludeinitiationofholdingat
presentposition; suspensionofmission;flybacktolaunchpoint;abortmissionand
land immediately; and emergency power cut off and land (Flight Termination
System).

Additional automated safety functions and safety enhancing features of the 360
DelawareOrbitTours' sUAV's mayincludethe following:

          1.1. Auto-pilot detection of lost GPS or of insufficient satellites initiates an
               immediate landing.

          1.4. Redundant "kill switches" that enable completely shutting the aircraft
               down in flight in the event of a loss of control or un-commanded
               deviationfromtheflightpath.

          1.6. The motors are driven by pulse width modulated signals, not analog

               signals.

          1.7. The aircraft will operate for the Purposes at no more than 30 mph
               (while imaging) nor above 200 feet above the structure (imaging
               altitude)oramaximumof400 AGL.

Given these safety features, 360 Delaware Orbit Tours proposes that Operators of
the 360DelawareOrbitTours' sUAV should notberequiredtoholdacommercial
orprivatepilotcertification.

Instead, Operators should be required to: have successfully completed, at a
minimum, FAA private pilot ground instruction and passed the FAA Private Pilot
written examination or FAA-recognized equivalents; have completed the
manufacturer'sor360DelawareOrbitTours' trainingprogramforoperationof the
UAS.

360 Delaware Orbit Tours notes that the FAA has found that safety factors
permitted operation of UASs by Operators with these qualifications in the case of
operations pursuant to public COAs where the mandatory operating conditions
specified above were present. See, Federal Aviation Administration, Notice N-
8900.227, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operational Approval, at 20-21 (July
30, 2013). Likewise, 360 Delaware Orbit Tours notes that the NPRM does not
requirethattheOperatorholdaprivatepilotlicenseissuedbytheFAA.

Given these conditions and restrictions, an equivalent level of safety will be
provided by allowing operation of the 360 Delaware Orbit Tours' sUAV without a
privatepilot'scertificateoracommercialpilot's certificate,undertheconditionsset
forthherein.

The risks associated with the operation of the 360 Delaware Orbit Tours' sUAV
(given its size,speed,operational capabilities, andlack ofcombustible fuel)areso

commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 with conventional aircraft (fixed

operations of the sUAS will ensure separation between these small-UAS operations
and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.
The FAA has granted exemptions to conduct similar operations in Exemptions
11062through11067,11080and 11110.

14 C.F.R. §91.121 Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising
altitude by reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure
airportoranappropriate altimetersettingavailablebeforedeparture."Asthe360
Delaware Orbit Tours' sUAV, in manual or emergency mode, will not have a
barometricaltimeter display,butinstead a GPSaltitude display,an exemption will
be needed. The Operator, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Manuals as
indicated before flight, will achieve an equivalent level of safety. The FAA has
granted exemptions to conduct similar operations in Exemptions 11062 through
11067,11080 and11110.

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

Section 91.151(a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane
