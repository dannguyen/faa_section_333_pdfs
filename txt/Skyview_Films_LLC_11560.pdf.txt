                                                           Exemption No. 11560
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0417

Ms. Terry L. Carbonell
Attorney for the Petitioner
100 South Airport Road
Tavernier, FL 33070

Dear Ms. Carbonell:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated February 19, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Skyview Films, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial videography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received one comment in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom II.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Skyview Films, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Skyview Films, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.
                                                                                                            3

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom II
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
                                                                                                            4

    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
                                                                                                            5

    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
                                                                                                               6

       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.

   30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
       exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
       District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
                                                                                                                 7

         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:

           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted

              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;

                                           SUMMARY

Skyview Films, LLC ("Skyview") seeks an exemption from the requirements of 14 CFR §§
61.113(a) and (b), 91.7(a), 91.119(b) and (c), 91.121, 91.151(a), 91.405(a) and (b),
91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b). The exemption will permit
Skyview to operate a UAS over certain areas throughout the United States, while keeping
documents required by the regulations at the ground control station and immediately
accessible to the PIC.

                                        BACKGROUND

Over the past 20 years, the principals of Skyview have been separately in the business of
Commercial Video and Film for the Real Estate Market, Public Broadcast Television,
Video/Film Contractors, Tourism industry and Native American Documentaries for
Federally Recognized Tribes in the US. With the introduction of the UAS technology,
Skyview was incorporated and desires to offer aerial videography through the use of the
UAS Phantom II manufactured by DJI. Skyview has 2 Phantom II units currently being
registered with the FAA under registration numbers N735SF and N736SF. Skyview has
plans to add 2 additional units, registered under reserved numbers N737SF and N738SF.
Registration numbers will be placed in accordance with §45.29(f) and will be as large as
possible on the fuselage of the UAS.

Skyview has received numerous requests from real estate professionals, construction
professionals and the motion picture industry for aerial videography services. Such
services are currently unavailable to these industries without the use of manned aircraft,
which poses a significant risk to the pilots and videographers participating in the video
production. The use of UAS will eliminate the hazards associated with manned flight.
Additionally, use of videography in the mainstream real estate market has been cost
prohibitive, depriving the average homeowner the opportunities afforded more affluent
homeowners: video "tours" of their homes and surrounding area for marketing and sales.
Specific examples of missions that Skyview seeks to accept are:

1|Page
         (a) Videography of single family and multi-family dwelling units.
         (b) Videography of residential, high rise and commercial structures under

             construction, including roof inspections.
         (c) Videography of television programs on set and outdoors in a controlled

             environment.
         (d) Videography of livestock in ranches and crop monitoring.
         (e) Videography monitoring of dangerous sea-life to protect beachgoers from large

             predators during migration season.
         (f) Aerial videography for visitor and convention bureaus and production of public

             service announcements.

Skyview's chief pilot has extensive experience in the use of UAS technology in video
production. Skyview has developed operational protocol, including minimum flight time,
training requirements and currency requirements for PICs to enhance the safety of UAS
flight and integration of UAS in the NAS. Granting Skyview's petition comports with the
Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's) responsibilities and authority to
not only integrate UAS into the NAS, but to "...establish requirements for the safe operation
of such aircraft systems [UAS's] in the national airspace system" under Section 333(c)
of the Reform Act specific to the use of UAS's for real estate, construction and public
interest functions. Skyview will conduct their operations in compliance with the
procedures described in their operation manual and as otherwise directed by the FAA.

                     PETITION FOR EXEMPTION & DISCUSSION

Petitioner, SKYVIEW FILMS, LLC, by and through its undersigned counsel, pursuant to the
provisions of 14 CFR §11.61 and Section 333, hereby petitions the Administrator for
exemption from the requirements of 14 CFR §§ 61.113(a) and (b), 91.7(a), 91.119(b) and (c),
91.121, 91.151(a), 91.405(a) and (b), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b).

Request for exemption from 14 CFR 61.113(a) and (b)
§61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, no person who holds a
private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers
or property for compensation or hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as
pilot in command of an aircraft.
(b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft in
connection with any business or employment if:
(1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and
(2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire.

Under current regulations, civil operations for compensation or hire require a PIC holding a
commercial pilot certificate per 14 CFR 61. Based on the private pilot limitations in
accordance with pertinent parts of 14 CFR 61.113(a) and (b), a pilot holding a private pilot
certificate cannot act as a PIC of an aircraft for compensation or hire unless the flight is only
incidental to a business or employment. However, in Grant of Exemption No. 11062 to
Astraeus Aerial (Astraeus), the FAA determined that a PIC with a private pilot certificate
operating the Astraeus UAS would not adversely affect operations in the NAS or present a
hazard to persons or property on the ground.

3|Page
The petition of Skyview does not differ significantly from the situation described in Grant of
Exemption No. 11062 (Astraeus) and Exemption No. 11138 (Trudeau). The petitioner
plans to operate in the NAS over private property while also limiting access to the property
at times he is operating the UAS. Given: 1) the similar nature of the Skyview's proposed
operating environment to that of Astraeus and Trudeau, 2) the parallel nature of private
pilot aeronautical knowledge requirements to those of commercial, and 3) the airmanship
skills necessary to operate the UAS, the additional manned airmanship experience of a
commercially certificated pilot would not correlate to the airmanship skills necessary for
the Skyview's proposed operations.

The FAA in Exemption No. 11138 (Trudeau) recognized that given the relative size, weight,
speed and operating parameters of the proposed UAS operations and its accompanying
reduction in risk to persons and property when compared to manned operations, these
minimum requirements as stated in Exemption No. 11062 (Astreaus) should be reduced,
but not eliminated. UAS operators still need to establish airmanship skills in order to meet
the conditions and limitations listed below such as the ability to maneuver near but
maintain specific distances from persons and property, respond to unexpected
emergencies, or avoid objects as well as the ability to avoid potential conflicts with manned
aircraft. In consideration of the above, the FAA determined that there is an appropriate
level of pilot flight hours necessary to qualify the PIC for the Skyview's type of proposed
operations.

Skyview is responsible for assessing its operations and identifying any additional skills
required to operate safely under normal and abnormal conditions. Normal condition skills
may include the ability to maintain altitude, maintain VLOS, and navigational skills.
Abnormal condition skills may include the ability to avoid obstacles, avoid air traffic, and
respond to loss of link. In a manner consistent with 14 C.F.R. § 61.51(b), Skyview has
established minimum PIC requirements, continued training and skills assessment and
evaluation by the chief pilot. Skyview Operations Manual requires all PICs to have a current
third class medical certificate, and a private or higher pilot certificate, at least 25 hours of
total time as a UAS rotorcraft pilot including at least 10 hours logged as a UAS pilot with a
4|Page
multi-rotor UAS and a minimum of 5 hours as a UAS pilot operating the same make and
model of UAS to be used for Skyview missions. Additionally, the PIC must accomplish 3
take-offs and landings in the preceding 90 days and 3 return to home emergency
procedures within the preceding 30 days for currency purposes.

Request for exemption from 14 CFR 91.7(a)
§91.7 Civil aircraft airworthiness.
(a) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition.

Skyview's aircraft will be registered but will not require an airworthiness certificate as
contemplated by the provisions of 14 CFR part 21 or 23 so compliance with §91.7 will not
be accomplished through traditional means. Skyview will maintain the manufactures
operating annual in addition to its own company operations manual. Skyview submits that
compliance with these operating documents will be sufficient means for determining an
"airworthy condition".

Request for exemption from 14 CFR 91.119(b) and (c)
§91.119 Minimum safe altitudes: General.
Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below the
following altitudes:
(b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any
open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a
horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
(c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over
open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated
closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.

Determination of a definition of "congested area" becomes a bit more difficult when dealing
with UAS operation, especially where the UAS has a gross weight of approximately 3
pounds. It can certainly be said that a "congested area" would include areas where there is
a concentration of people or traffic under the flight path of the UAS or where there is a
dense concentration of buildings under the flight path of the UAS. There are areas,

5|Page
however, within the traditional "congested area" for purposes of manned flight that would

be inappropriate to exclude from the realm of UAS flight. Such areas would include:

         (a) Construction sites ­ a defined and confined area generally protected from the

             general public where participating people (construction workers) are protected

             from overhead hazards and work in an environment where such hazards

             routinely exist.

         (b) Residential dwelling units ­ a defined area that could be easily blocked to

             restrict the access by the general public. Participating people would be limited to

             UAS flight crew and homeowner/realtor.

The superior maneuverability of the small UAS make them ideal candidate for operations in

smaller confined spaces where larger certificated aircraft cannot maneuver.

Relief from § 91.119(b) is necessary in limited circumstances such as construction sites or

other venues where participating persons routinely operate in an environment where

known hazards exist and they use protective equipment (hard hats and eye protection) for

protection from those hazards. Additional precautions are stated in Skyview's Operations

Manual:

        "Prior to the start of any operation under the provisions of this manual, the pilot in
        command shall brief all participating personnel. The briefing will include: all
        procedures, the risks involved, emergency procedures, and safeguards to be followed
        during the filming production event. Personnel will also be briefed on additional
        mission provisions that may be issued by the FAA Representatives, local law
        enforcement personnel, the chief pilot or other individual that has geographic
        responsibility for the operational area, including the location of boundaries or time
        limits. The briefing shall specifically include:

           · Authorization for video certificate of waiver and the attached
               special provisions

           · Procedures contained in this Operations manual
           · Plan of activities
           · Radio Communications
           · Take-off procedures
           · Aviation activities to be conducted during the filming production event
           · Approach and landing procedures
           · Recall procedures
           · Emergency procedures
           · Risks to participating personnel
           · How to control non-participating persons"

6|Page
Relief from § 91.119(c) is necessary because the aircraft will be operated at altitudes below

400' AGL. Skyview Pre-flight Check List provides the mechanism for obstacle location and

avoidance:

"Check Area for Obstacles

         - Note location of public and private use airports and heliports and medical heliports
         and helipads
         - Inspect flight zone for utility poles, transmission and guy wires, trees and
         Other vertical obstacles to flight
         - Inspect traffic patterns and flow of adjacent roadways and parking areas and
         ensure traffic flow will not be impacted, nor drivers distracted
         - Inspect flight zone for suitability of adjacent public viewing area protected from
         flight zone
         - Locate and define take-off and landing zone (LZ)"

The Operations Manual additionally provides:

"The certificate holder shall ensure that no persons are allowed within 100 feet of the flight
zone except those consenting to be involved and those necessary for the video production.
This provision may be modified if the level of safety can be achieved and the Administrator has
approved. For example, an equivalent level of safety may be determined by an evaluation of
the video production area to note terrain features, obstructions, buildings, etc. Such barriers
may protect nonparticipating persons (observers, the public, news media, etc.) from debris in
the event of an accident."

Finally, in support of exemption from both 91.119(b) and (c), Skyview has established and

the PICs are required to practice and become proficient in executing emergency

procedures. The Skyview Pre-flight Check List provides:

"1. Lost sight of UAS ­ Perform Return Home Procedure
2. UAS out of control ­ Perform Return Home Procedure
3. UAS Battery low ­ Return UAS to LZ immediately
4. IMMEDIATELY land UAS at nearest safe ground location if:

         - manned or other unmanned aircraft is in the vicinity of flight zone
         - unauthorized persons or equipment enter the flight zone
         - hazardous weather conditions develop
         - bird flock enters the flight zone
         - traffic obstruction occurs
         - PIC becomes distracted believes safety is compromised for any reason"

Request for exemption from 14 CFR 91.121
§91.121 Altimeter settings.
(a) Each person operating an aircraft shall maintain the cruising altitude or flight level of
that aircraft, as the case may be, by reference to an altimeter that is set, when operating--
(1) Below 18,000 feet MSL, to--
(i) The current reported altimeter setting of a station along the route and within 100 nautical
miles of the aircraft;
(ii) If there is no station within the area prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the
current reported altimeter setting of an appropriate available station; or
(iii) In the case of an aircraft not equipped with a radio, the elevation of the departure airport
or an appropriate altimeter setting available before departure.

The Phantom II unit is equipped with GPS derived altitude capabilities. The FAA discussion
in Exemption No. 11138 (Trudeau) is applicable to Skyview operations. Due to the limited
altitude of the proposed operations (400' AGL and below), it is requested that operational
altitudes be reported to ATC in terms of AGL.

Request for exemption from 14 CFR 91.151
§91.151 Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.
(a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless (considering
wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended
landing and, assuming normal cruising speed--
(1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes.
The operating documents, specifically, the Phantom II User Manual, indicate that two low-
voltage (low battery) alerts are issued - warning that the first alert should be followed
(30% - low battery level warning). Also, the UAS has an automated function which results
in immediate landing when a low battery is detected. The Skyview Check List provides for
the PIC to continuously monitor the UAS battery and prohibit operation with lower than
30% battery life remaining. These factors should provide the FAA with sufficient reason to
grant the relief from 14 CFR 91.151(a) and prohibit the PIC from beginning a flight unless
(considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough power to fly to the first
point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, land the UA with 30%
battery power remaining.

§91.405 Maintenance required.
Each owner or operator of an aircraft--
(a) Shall have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between
required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies
repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter.

§91.407 Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or
alteration.
(a) No person may operate any aircraft that has undergone maintenance, preventive
maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration unless--
(1) It has been approved for return to service by a person authorized under §43.7 of this
chapter;

§91.409 Inspections.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person may operate an aircraft
unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, it has had--
(1) An annual inspection in accordance with part 43 of this chapter and has been approved
for return to service by a person authorized by §43.7 of this chapter; or
(2) An inspection for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate in accordance with part 21 of
this chapter.

§91.417 Maintenance records.
(a) Except for work performed in accordance with §§91.411 and 91.413, each registered
owner or operator shall keep the following records for the periods specified in paragraph (b)
of this section:
(1) Records of the maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration and records of the
100-hour, annual, progressive, and other required or approved inspections, as appropriate,
for each aircraft (including the airframe) and each engine, propeller, rotor, and appliance of
an aircraft. The records must include--
(i) A description (or reference to data acceptable to the Administrator) of the work
performed; and
(ii) The date of completion of the work performed; and
(iii) The signature, and certificate number of the person approving the aircraft for return to
service.
(2) Records containing the following information:
(i) The total time in service of the airframe, each engine, each propeller, and each rotor.
(ii) The current status of life-limited parts of each airframe, engine, propeller, rotor, and
appliance.
(iii) The time since last overhaul of all items installed on the aircraft which are required to be
overhauled on a specified time basis.
(iv) The current inspection status of the aircraft, including the time since the last inspection
required by the inspection program under which the aircraft and its appliances are
maintained.

9|Page
(v) The current status of applicable airworthiness directives (AD) and safety directives
including, for each, the method of compliance, the AD or safety directive number and revision
date. If the AD or safety directive involves recurring action, the time and date when the next
action is required.

The above maintenance provisions apply to aircraft that have an airworthiness certificate.
The aircraft operated by Skyview will not have an airworthiness certificate so these
regulations should not apply to Skyview. Skyview proposes that the PIC be the primary
inspector in lieu of the maintenance personnel contemplated by the above regulation. Prior
to each flight the PIC will inspect the aircraft to assure that it is in airworthy condition. Any
maintenance issues or replacement of consumable items shall be accomplished prior to the
initiation of flight and documented in accordance with the Operations Manual and check
list. Under no circumstances shall the UAS be operated if there is any question as to the
airworthiness of the aircraft. Due to the relatively small size and lack of complexity of the
Phantom II unit, the PIC can ensure the proper level of safety for aircraft airworthiness.

                                 PILOT QUALIFICATIONS

Skyview Operations Manual requires all PICs to have the following qualifications:
    1. current third class medical certificate
    2. private or higher pilot certificate
    3. at least 25 hours of total time as a UAS rotorcraft pilot including at least 10 hours
         logged as a UAS pilot with a multi-rotor UAS and a minimum of 5 hours as a UAS
         pilot operating the same make and model of UAS to be used for Skyview missions.
    4. the PIC must accomplish 3 take-offs and landings in the preceding 90 days for
         currency purposes.
    5. The PIC must accomplish 3 return to home emergency procedures in the preceding
         30 days for currency purposes.

11 | P a g e
Skyview employs a chief pilot, L. Felipe Marrou, who has logged over 150 hours operating
UAS with over 125 hours in the Phantom II. The chief pilot is responsible for oversight of all
PICs, determining if they are qualified and current and conducting periodic training for the
PICs to assure proficiency in emergency procedure and Skyview company operating
procedures.
Skyview employs one other qualified PIC, Atilano L Nunez who currently has 25 hours in
the Phantom II.

                                OPERATING PARAMETERS

While the Skyview Operations Manual provides the details for operational policies and
procedures, following is a summary to assist the FAA in determining that these policies and
procedures ensure an equivalent or higher level of safety to those operations conducted
under current FAA regulations:

    1. The UAS will weigh less than 4 pounds.
    2. All flights will be conducted within VLOS to the PIC and/or VO, which shall

         constitute the minimum crew for any flight.
    3. Maximum flight time on one fully charged battery will be the lesser of 30 minutes or

         30% battery life remaining, whichever should first occur.
    4. Standard flights will be at or below 400' AGL in day time VFR conditions. Special

         flights over 400' AGL will require the use of additional VOs and coordination with
         local ATC.
    5. Flights will be at a minimum distance of 100' from non-participating persons who
         are located behind a secure area. All participating personnel will be briefed on the
         UAS operations and have signed a consent to be participating in the secure
         operating area. At any location where UAS operations are overhead of participating
         personnel, safety equipment including hard hats and eye protection shall be utilized.
    6. All PICs must meet the minimum pilot qualifications as set forth by Skyview to
         include a private pilot certificate, third class medical certificate, at least 25 hours of
         total time as a UAS rotorcraft pilot including at least 10 hours logged as a UAS pilot

12 | P a g e
         with a multi-rotor UAS and a minimum of 5 hours as a UAS pilot operating the same
         make and model of UAS to be used for Skyview missions, and 3 take-offs and
         landings in the preceding 90 days and 3 return to home emergency procedures
         within the preceding 30 days for currency purposes.
    7. Operations will only take place in an area that has been cleared and secured in
         accordance with the Skyview Operations Manual.
    8. All PICs will strictly adhere to the check list for each and every flight including
         briefings, permissions, notifications, preflight actions, flight conditions and
         emergency procedures in the event of lost communications, intrusion into the
         secured area by non-participating persons, or other hazards.
    9. All required permissions, consents ad permits will be obtained in advance of each
         and every flight.
    10. Skyview will file the proper notifications with all local authorities, including filing
         NOTAMs where applicable.

                                     PUBLIC INTEREST

National policy established by Congress favors integration of UAS into the NAS in
controlled and safe environments as outlined in this petition. Granting the Skyview petition
will offer the FAA an opportunity to further their knowledge base for conducting
commercial UAS operations in order to implement future rules for widespread use of UAS
in the NAS.
Specifically, Skyview is proposing to provide a safe and economical solution to Commercial
clients, construction and real estate companies, TV and Film Production companies etc. for
videography services to be used as marketing tools, educational tools, sales tools, etc.

                                         CONCLUSION

As set forth above Skyview Films, LLC seeks an exemption from the requirements of 14 CFR
§§ 61.113(a) and (b), 91.7(a), 91.119(b) and (c), 91.121, 91.151(a), 91.405(a) and (b),
91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) to operate a UAS over certain
areas throughout the United States. By granting this petition, the FAA will be fulfilling the

13 | P a g e
Congressional mandate to integrate UAS into the NAS and advancing the interest of the
public by permitting safe and economical use of UAS in the NAS.

     This waiver applies only to those persons, vehicles and structures directly involved
     in the performance of the actual video. The certificate holder shall ensure that no
     persons are allowed within 500 feet of the flight zone except those consenting to
     be involved and those necessary for the video production. This provision may be
     modified if the level of safety can be achieved and the Administrator has
     approved. For example, an equivalent level of safety may be determined by an
     evaluation of the video production area to note terrain features, obstructions,
     buildings, etc. Such barriers may protect nonparticipating persons (observers, the
     public, news media, etc.) from debris in the event of an accident.

  D. Area of Operations

       Skyview's approved area of operations will be the United States of America.

E. Plan of Activities

    At least three (3) days prior to any scheduled video, Skyview will submit a
    written plan of activities to the local FSDO having jurisdiction over that
    area. The plan of activities should include the following:

1. Dates and times for all flights.

2. Name and phone number of person responsible for the video production event.

Revised: February 19, 2015  Page 4 of 18
3. Name and phone number of person responsible for aircraft (PIC).

4. Make, model, and serial or N-number of aircraft to be used and type of
    airworthiness certificate, including category if applicable.

5. Name and certificate number of pilots involved in the video production
    event.

6. A statement that the waiver holder has obtained permission from property
    owners and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event. The list of
    those who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon
    request from the waiver holder.

7. Signature of waiver holder or representative.

8. A description of the flight activity including maps or diagrams of any area, city,
    town, county, and/or State over which filming will be conducted and the minimum
    altitudes essential to accomplish the operations.

    The three (3) day notification requirement may be waived; however, the operator
    should contact the FSDO as soon as possible with this request and be prepared
    to explain in detail why the three (3) day notification is not practical. An example
    of such a mission would be to video a phase of construction not easily scheduled
    due to weather constraints.

F. Permission to Operate

    Before any flight operations is conducted at or below 400 feet AGL under the
    provisions of the certificate of waiver and this manual, the operator will obtain
    permission to conduct these operations from property owners and local officials
    as necessary or appropriate. Persons from whom permission may be required
    are listed below:

     (1) Property owners
     (2) Law enforcement officials
     (3) Fire department officials
     (4) Local, State and Federal government officials
     (5) Air traffic control

The Skyview personnel obtaining such permission will do so in writing whenever
practical; however, verbal permission is acceptable otherwise. A standard
permission form is provided in Appendix A and may be used when obtaining
written permission. Skyview personnel will assure a sufficient number of those
forms are available at the job site. Written permission forms will be maintained at
the job site until flight operations are completed, and then turned into the chief
pilot to be kept on file for a minimum of six (6) months. These forms will be

Revised: February 19, 2015  Page 5 of 18
made available for inspection by the FAA or other official personnel upon
request.

Operations may be permitted above 400' AGL under extremely limited
circumstances. Any operation above 400'AGL shall be conducted for the
shortest duration possible to accomplish the task and shall be completed at the
lowest altitude to accomplish the task. Specific examples of tasks requiring
operation above 400' AGL would be videography of high rise construction
activities, inspection of structures in excess of 400', and similar such tasks.

    For operations above 400' AGL all effort shall be made to remain as close to the
    obstacle being filed as safely possible in order to avoid any possible conflict with
    other air traffic in the surrounding area.

G. Security

    Prior to any flight operation, the operator will coordinate with appropriate
    production personnel to devise a plan of securing the area(s) of operation from
    all unauthorized persons and vehicles. Areas of special emphasis shall include:

             a) Local weather conditions
             b) Local airspace and any flight restrictions
             c) Location of persons and property on the ground
             d) Location of any ground obstacles
             e) Assessment of the operating area to ensure that the operations will

                  pose no undue hazard to other aircraft, people or property in the event
                  of loss of control.

If the operations take place I an area or at an altitude where other air traffic could
pose a hazard, the local ATC shall be notified as to the location of the operations
and additional VOs will be used to warn the PIC and ATC if aircraft are
approaching the area of operations.

Provisions will be made to immediately discontinue operations should the area(s)
become unsecured or for any other reason in the interest of safety. A Preflight
Check List detailing procedures is attached as Appendix B.2.

H. Briefing of Pilot/Production Personnel

Prior to the start of any operation under the provisions of this manual, the pilot in
command shall brief all participating personnel. The briefing will include: all
procedures, the risks involved, emergency procedures, and safeguards to be
followed during the filming production event. Personnel will also be briefed on
additional mission provisions that may be issued by the FAA Representatives,
local law enforcement personnel, the chief pilot or other individual that has
geographic responsibility for the operational area, including the location of
boundaries or time limits. The briefing shall specifically include:

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote control and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control system

connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more

information.

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G Wi-Fi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
          updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
          while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote control's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range

during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Control Operation

  The operations of remote control are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote control are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote control is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

Control    nose direction
(Mode 2)                                  The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                                          Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                          Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                          The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                                          altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                          Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                          position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                                          suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                          prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                          elevation changes.

                                                      The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                                      clock-wise.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      forward.
                                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                                      stick is centered.
                                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                                      faster flight velocity.
                                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                                      centered.
                                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in
                                                      a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

                                                         Flip once

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote control and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

A                                         BC          D

                                          Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote control.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Control Operation> for

      more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 |
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
          4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote control is lost. The flight control system
will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote control and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote control is powered off.
2 The remote control is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must have

        been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote control.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the aircraft, essentially reducing

        the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 |
Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures

1 Record Home Point.                       2 Flying.                                         3 Remote controller signal lost.

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
        will descend automatically.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
control from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position as
a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks on
the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:
1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is

        recorded last time.
2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

                      distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote control's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,
                      make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.
