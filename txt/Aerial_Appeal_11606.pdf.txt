                                                           Exemption No. 11606
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0510

Mr. Brian Shannon
Aerial Appeal
5114 Grand Phillips Lane
Katy, TX 77450

Dear Mr. Shannon:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated February 26, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Aerial Appeal (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial filming
and photography for coverage of events, enhanced real estate listings, and structural
inspections.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI F550, DJI Phantom 2, DJI S800 EVO, and
DJI Inspire.
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Aerial Appeal is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Aerial Appeal is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI F550, DJI
         Phantom 2, DJI S800 EVO, and DJI Inspire when weighing less than 55 pounds
         including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
         petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

                        Aircraft Nose Direction

step1:         Servo Installation (If the servos have already been installed, please skip this step.)

1. (Shown in the Fig) Define and mark the two HS-7954SH servos from Hitec as left servo and right servo.

2. Connect the left servo to the [L] port on the control board, and the right servo to the [R] port.

3. Keep pressing the SET button with aid of a small tool, and then power on. You will see the yellow LED

        beside SET button flashes quickly, and then wait until the servos have finished their position initialization.

4. Make sure the servo arm is parallel to the servo's center line.

5. Power off, assemble the left and right servos to the left and the right parts of the landing gear.

Tips: If you use your own servos, it is recommended to use the dedicated programmer from Hitec to enlarge the

servo travel from 120° to 150°, and then install servos by the above steps. Servos from DJI have been enlarged

servo travel.

step2: Mechanical Assembly
  1. Assemble the left and right parts respectively, and then fix the screws at the joints with appropriate
          thread locker.

  2. Connect the left and right parts with connecting rod.
  3. For safety reasons, make sure to connect the springs to both parts.

 step3: Electrical Connections

  1. Plug the cables from the servos into the correct ports on the control board. Make sure the right servo is
          connected to the [R] port, and the left servo to the [L] port.

  2. Connect the required 2-position switch of R/C receiver to the [IN] port.

2 Travel Calibration

If the Landing Gear you got has been installed with the servos, please skip this step. Otherwise, calibrate the system
using the following procedures.

  1. For safety reasons, please keep your hands away from any link mechanism to avoid injury.
  2. Make sure the [R], [L] and [IN] connections are correct and firmly connected.
  3. Hang the Landing Gear in the air during calibration, as the landing gear will move.
  4. Keep pressing the SET button using a small tool and power on. You can see the LED flashes YELLOW

          quickly, and then press the SET button once again. The system begins auto calibration with the indication
          of the LED flashing YELLOW slowly. DO NOT obstruct any moving part during auto calibration.
  5. The left-part is calibrated, the left link mechanism first moves up then moves down automatically. Then
          the right-part is calibrated, the right link mechanism first moves up then moves down automatically.
  6. After calibration, both left and right parts are in the [Lower] position, and the LED is solid GREEN on.
          Then the landing gear will work normally.
  Notes:
  (1) If the LED is solid YELLOW on during calibrating, it means that there is something wrong with the
          calibration, please re-do the Servo Installation of the Assembly & Connection section, since the servo arm
          might be installed with a wrong angle.
  (2) Please avoid any obstruction during calibrating. If the landing gear is blocked from moving, please
          recalibrate the landing gear by the above steps.
  (3) If the [R] and [L] servo cables are reversed, the travel will not be measured correctly. Please connect
          correctly and recalibrate the landing gear using the above steps.

  Select a 2-position switch (default setting is OK) of
  Transmitter as the control input of the landing gear, and
  then make sure the corresponding port of receiver is
  connected to the [IN] port on control board.

                                          gear (Fig. 2)

   Tips:
   (1) If the switch of Transmitter has FailSafe function,

            set the FailSafe value to the [Lower] position, so
            that the landing gear will be in [Lower] status when
            the receiver enters FailSafe mode, to land the
            aircraft safely.
   (2) To avoid false switch triggering, you can use the
            slide lever or other trim as the landing gear's
            control switch.

4 Usage

The landing gear can be used by following the steps below after assembly & connection.
  1. Make sure the transmitter & receiver batteries are fully charged.
  2. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position, and then turn on the transmitter.
  3. Make sure the [R], [L] and [IN] connections are correct and firmly connected.
  4. Make sure the Landing Gear is at the [Lower] position, and then power on the system. If the green LED is
         solid on, then this is a normal start. If the LED flashes GREEN slowly, please re-calibrate the system
         according to the procedure of Travel Calibration.
  5. Make sure to toggle the switch to the [Retracted] position ONLY AFTER you takeoff the aircraft.
  6. When the aircraft is landing, please toggle the switch to the [Lower] position for a safe landing.
Tips
(1) The system will turn off the servo power temporarily within 3 seconds after the landing gear has reached

      the target position.
(2) When powering on the system, if the Transmitter switch is at the [Retracted] position, which is the unsafe

      signal for the landing gear, the LED will quickly flash RED. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position.
(3) If there is an abnormal signal or no signal input into the [IN] port the LED will slowly flash RED. Please

      check the receiver and the connections.
(4) If the power consumption of servos is too large during usage, the LED will be solid RED on. If this status

      lasts more than 4 seconds, the landing gear will lower and the LED will flash GREEN slowly. Please
      re-calibrate the system.

        Aerial Appeal
Procedures & Operations
 Safety for public on the ground as well as manned aircraft above is an essential and
 utmost consideration for aerial videos and photography. As such, safety protocols and controls
 must be implemented through pre-flight preparation and during flight.

 Pre-Flight Procedures:

    Check batteries with voltage meter to insure fully charged and ready for use.
    Inspect batteries for damage or leakage that may affect proper operation.
    Inspect propellers for cracks, chips or damage.
    Check weather forecasts for wind advisory or other conditions that my impact flight.
    Consult five (5) mile radius map for airport/heliport locations.
 Inspect flight area for

          location of light poles
          proximity to utility wires
          vicinity of trees
          flocks of birds that may cause interference and potential flight impact
          vicinity of any elevated obstructions that may pose potential flight hazard
          optional point of control for best visual site of UAS while in flight
    Takeoff and landing
          inspect area for best and safest point of takeoff and landing

 Flight Procedures:

           Takeoff and land from same location
           Remain alert to birds, sound or aircraft, curious public, and approaching vehicles
           Do not allow anyone to engage in conversation or distract the PIC

           Restrict flight to minimal elevation sufficient to achieve desired results
           Remain prepared for emergency landing at all times
           Pay attention to flight time

                o Always set a timer as a safety alert to provide 30% power remaining upon landing
           Land UAS and shut down propulsion immediately following landing
