                                                           Exemption No. 13038
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2761

Mr. Jeffrey W. Logan
Vice President Operations
Paragon Geophysical Services, Inc.
3500 North Rock Road, Building 800, Suite B
Wichita, KS 67226

Dear Mr. Logan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 8, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Paragon Geophysical Services, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct site survey, quality control data collection, volumetric, geo-location magnetic and
gravity measurements, aerial photography, videography, agriculture, scientific studies,
wildlife monitoring and forestry.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the Sensurion Magpie MP-1, DJI Spreading Wings
S1000+, DJI Inspire, and DJI Phantom.
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Paragon Geophysical Services, Inc. is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Paragon Geophysical Services, Inc is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Sensurion Magpie
         MP-1, DJI Spreading Wings S1000+, DJI Inspire, and DJI Phantom when weighing
         less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will
         require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
         permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
                                                                                                            4

    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

Appendix A discusses each rule listed above and explains why exemptions pursuant to the
proposal set forth in this letter are appropriate, provide an equivalent level of safety,and are in
the public interest.

Paragon Geophysical Services, Inc. has been in operation for more than 30 years and is dedicated
to helping companies discover oil, natural gas and geothermal reservoirs, while maintainin ~ the
hi~hest safety a.nd quality standards. Based out of Wichita, Kansas, Paragon recruits highly
experienced crew members a.nd utilizes the latest technolo ~y to deliver results and information
quicker than our competitors. Paragon" s continual investment in people and technoloay results in
a less environmentally invasive and less costly final product. Paragon's use of unmanned aerial
systems will reduce the amount of surface traffic on native grasslands, pastures a.nd cultivated
areas, which will in turn reduce possible surface dama ~e and compaction in environmentally
sensitive areas, thus would be in the best "public interest'".

                                         Equivalent Level of Safety

The applicant proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at
least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory
structure because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to operations that
would be conducted with conventional aircraft. These conditions are drawn from Exemptions
11062 through 11067, 11080, 11109, and 11110.

Below are the limitations and conditions to which Paragon (or "operator") agrees to be bound
when conductin~ commercial operations under an FAA issued exemption:

     1. Operations will be limited to the Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) listed below with
         type, weight and airspeeds indicated. All UAS listed have a weight of less than 55
         pounds includina payload, and having a maximum airspeed of less than 87 knots (100

2. The UAS will not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). In no
    case will the UAS be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum UAS operatin ~
    airspeed recommended by the aircraft ma.nufacturer.

3. The UAS will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ~round level
    (AGL). Altitude will be reported in feet AGL.

4. The UAS must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot-in-command
    (PIC) at all times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any
    device other than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical
    certificate or U.S. driver's license.

5. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UAS must be operated within the
    visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used to
    satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability. The
    VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times; electronic messaging or
    texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must be designated before the
    fli<-Yht and cannot transfer his or her designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC
    must ensure that the VO can perform the duties required of the VO.

    operating documents must be accessible durino , UAS -operations and made available to
    the Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in the FAA approved exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating
    documents, the conditions and limitations in the FAA approved exemption take
    precedence and must be followed. Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as
    outlined in its operatinc , documents.

    The operator may update or revise its operatin ~ documents. It is the operator's
    responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised documents to the
    Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The operator must also
    present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension of or amendment to its
    FAA approved exemption. If the operator determines that any update or revision would
    affect the basis upon which the FAA ganted its exemption, then the operator must
    petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS Integation Offfice
    (AFS - 80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the
    operating documents.

7. Any UAS that has underaone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or
    flight characteristics, e.cr., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo a
    functional test flicrht prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test fli ~hts may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such a
    manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

8. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is in
    a condition for safe operation.

9. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the UAS
    is in a condition for safe fli ~ht. The pre-fli ~ht inspection must account for all potential
    discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the inspection reveals
    a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is prohibited from
    operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the UAS is found to
    be in a condition for safe fli ~ht.

10. The operator will follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul, replacement,
    inspection, a.nd life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft components.

11. Each UAS operated under this petition will comply with all manufacturer safety bulletins.

    manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated will adhere to the conditions and
    limitations specified within this petition for exemption. Traininc, operations may only be
    conducted durin~ dedicated training sessions. Durin ~ trainin~, proficiency, and
    experience-buildin~ fli~hts, all persons not essential for flight operations are considered
    nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UAS with appropriate dista.nce from
    nonparticipants in accorda.nce with 14 CFR 5 91.119.

14. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR S 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorolo ~ical conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

15. The UAS may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not denoted
    with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-published
    aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's management is
    obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption holder. The letter of
    agreement with the airport management must be made available to the Administrator or
    any law enforcement official upon request.

16. The UAS may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

17. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UAS must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

18. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emercrencies.

    large as practicable.

22. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR 5 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the PIC at
    the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request.

23. The UAS must remain clear a.nd give way to all manned aviation operations and activities
    at all times.

24. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any movina device or vehicle.

25. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipatincl,
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
         a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UAS and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection a.nd are within 500 feet of

Unless otherwise specified in this petition for exemption, the UAS, the UAS PIC, and the UAS
operations will comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45,
47, 61, and 91.
The operation of small UAS, weighing less than fifty pounds, conducted in the strict conditions
outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exemptions
requested herein. These lightweiaht aircraft operate at relatively slow speeds, near the ground,
and in areas that are under the control of the operator. As a result, they, are far safer than
conventional operations conducted with manned aircraft operating in close proximity to the
ground and people.

         :- States: Each pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiaY
             with all available information concerning that flight. This information must
             include- (paragraphs a, b, I and 2)

    A pre-flight mission brief will be attended by all crew members. This "PMB" will
    contain weather and all flight information includin ~ emer~ency and abort procedures. A
    signature will be required by all crew members indicating they have received the PMB
    and have read any NOTAMs or other procedural updates which may have impact to
    standard operatinb procedures. In addition, the PIC will verify the UAS is readv for flight
    by conductinor a pre-flight inspection.

    The exemption requested for this section is specifically addressed toward the
    requirements which do not apply to UAS operations such as runways and air traffic
    control integration.

    the use of pre-determined GPS enabled waypoints pro ~rammed before or durin ~ fli~ht
    and/or the use of a sin ale hand held transmitter or control station controlled by the PIC.
    This design does not allow for dual controls during flight training and therefore the

    within Class C and D airspace, Paragon will submit a request and operate under an
    approved COA.

    As UAS are inherently safer than traditional aircraft due to their small size, light weight,
    battery operation versus fuel and have no humans on-board; Paragon will not operate
    within 500 feet of any vehicles, persons or structures other than those part of the flight
    operation being conducted. In addition, objects and hazards identified and geo-located
    prior to flight operations will be utilized within the flight plannina stages to ensure this
    obj ective is met.

    14 C.F.R. § 91.121
         > States: Each person opeYating an aircYaft shall maintain the cf°uising altitude or
            f ight level of that aiYcraft, as the case may be, by YefeT°ence to an altimeteY that is
             set, when oper°ating...

    UAS are equipped with Global Positionin ~ System (GPS) which provide altitude and
    ~eo-location data to the operator versus utilizing an altimeter. Due to this fact, an
    exemption is required for this system to be utilized in fli ~ht. GPS are precise within a few
    feet vertically and therefore meet a safety level equal to if not higher than regulatory
    ~uida.nce.

    As described in the limitations and conditions section of Paragon's petition for
    exemption; in the event the UAS loses GPS signal, automated landing will immediately
    commence. The flight plan is built in such a way that hazards are identified prior to
    launch and an immediate landincr within the fliaht plan will ensure all hazards are
    avoided.

· 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a)
         y- States: No peYson may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
             (consideringg wind and foYecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
             the fiYst point of intended landing and., assuming normal cr°uising speed-- (1)
             DuYing the day, to fly afteY that for at least 30 minutes;

    This regulation is based on the capabilities of a traditional aircraft which have flight times
    of several hours or greater; therefore, with the majority of UAS, which have flicrht times
    of an hour or less, this regulation would effectively deny the ability of the UAS to
    operate.

    Drawing from previously approved Exemptions the PIC is will not begin a flight unless
    (considerin~ wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enou ~h available power for
    the UAS to conduct the intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes

    ability to quickly and safely land UAS in non-traditional environments ensures at least a.n
    equal level of safety.

    Due to the fact the proposed UAS presently do not have airworthiness certificates, these
    regulations do not apply and therefore an exemption is required. Pre/Post flight and
    routine inspections and maintenance will be conducted in accordance with the
    manufacturer's auidance as stated in the user/maintenance manuals. Paragon will
    maintain logs of pre- and post-flight inspections. In the event maintena.nce is required, the
    PIC will verify the UAS is in an airworthy status prior to operational use.

    All inspection a.nd maintenance will be documented and maintained in-house. These
    actions will meet the intent of the reaulation exemption is beine , requested and lead to the
    equivalent level of safety.
