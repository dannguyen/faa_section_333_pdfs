                                                           Exemption No. 12604
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1881

Mr. Jonathan F. Mayhall
Counsel
Lanier Ford Shaver and Payne P.C.
P. O. Box 2087
Huntsville, AL 35804

Dear Mr. Mayhall:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of AirGon, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The petitioner
requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography, data
collection, training programs1, and demonstration flights.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

1 The petitioner requested authority to conduct UAS training. At this time, the FAA is unable to authorize UAS
operations for training until a further assessment is completed. When the FAA completes its review, we will
proceed accordingly and no further action will be required by the petitioner. However, the petitioner is permitted
to train its own pilot in commands and visual observers in accordance with condition no. 14 and the other
conditions and limitations in this exemption.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is an AV-900.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection2. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

2 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                3

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, AirGon, LLC is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, AirGon, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the AV-900 when
    weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
                                                                                            4

duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.
                                                                                                            5

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
                                                                                                            6

    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.
                                                                                                                 7

    28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
         boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
         to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
         reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
         contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the
"Act") and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, AirGon, LLC ("AirGon") seeks exemption from the Federal
Aviation Regulations ("FARs") identified below. AriGon seeks expedited approval and
exemption to allow commercial use of its AV-900 small Unmanned Aircraft System
("UAS") for the purpose of aerial photography, data collection, training programs, and
demonstration flights. All operations will follow strict operational limitations as
described in this document and the attached "AV-900 Mission Planning Guide/' "AV-900
Operations Guide/' the "AV-900 System Guide/' the "AV-900 Training Guide/' and the
"AV-900 Pre-flight Checklist" (collectively, the "Operating Documents"), as well as all
recommendations, limitation, and conditions by the FAA.

    A. Background.

    1. AirGon, LLC.

         AirGon is the airborne micro metric mapping subsidiary of the GeoCue Group
("GeoCue"). GeoCue has been providing workflow and production solutions for sensor-
based mapping since 2003. GeoCue has a long history in providing tools and
technology used in creating accurate mapping products from manned aircraft sensor
data. GeoCue is now applying this reservoir of experience to the challenges of collecting
metric mapping information using low cost technology.

         AirGon is focused on creating metric mapping information from hyper-
economical, small UA5. AirGon offers a complete range of products and services aimed
at rapid collection of accurate analytic data and the creation of 2D and 3D derivative
products.

    2. AV-900.

         The AV-900 is a vertical take-off and landing ("VTOL") hexcopter built on the DJI-
5900 commercial kit. It is 39.4" diameter, 19.7" tall (excluding the 7.9" GN55 mast) and
has a typical takeoff weight of 14.872 lbs. (with a standard 65 21,000mAh battery, NEX-5
camera and 20 mm lens) and maximum takeoff weight of 18.07 lbs. The AV-900 system
uses the "3D" Robotics "Pixhawk" realization of the PX4 autopilot system, which
supports the multiple waypoint navigation necessary for precision mapping and
contains a number of failsafe features to ensure safe operations. For additional
information on the AV-900 please see the Operating Documents, which specify
manufacturing information, aircraft performance, operating limits, normal and
emergency operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. Although the AV-900
is a proprietary system, all major components of the system have been approved in
previous grants of exemption. UA5 based on the DJI-5900 kit have been previously
approved by the FAA in Exemptions 11305 and 11326, and UA5 incorporating the
Pixhawk autopilot have been approved in Exemptions 11192 and 11166. All operating
parameters in this case are identical or substantially similar to the approved operating
parameters in the Exemptions listed above as well as those in Exemptions 1109, 1112,
and 11213.

    B. Publication in the Federal Register.

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 11.87, AirGon requests that the FAA not publish this
petition request in the Federal Register and not delay action based on the following:

    1. This petition for exemption does not set precedent.
    2. The requested relief is identical or substantially similar to the that granted

         previously, specifically, Exemptions Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, 11213, 11305,
         11326, 11192, 11166, and others.
    3. A delay in action on this petition would result in lost opportunities revenues from
         potential operations as well as a delay in the public benefit of granting this

                                                            2
         petition. In addition, a competitive advantage for unapproved commercial UAS
         operators exists and continues to grow every day.

         Notwithstanding your decision on whether to publish this petition in the Federal
Register, all of the Operating Documents submitted with this petition contain
confidential, proprietary information that is not available to the general public. Pursuant
to 14 C.F.R. § 11.35(b), AirGon requests that the Operating Documents not be published
in the Federal Register or made available to the general public.

    C. Statutory Authority.

    1. FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Section 333.

         Section 333(a) states that the FAA "shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft
systems may operate safely in the national airspace before completion of the plan and
rulemaking required by section 332." Section 333(b) lays out factors for the FAA to
consider in making the determination under Section 333(a). Specifically, the FAA shall
determine "which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size,
weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and
operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the national
airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security." Section 333(b)(2)
also specifies that the FAA shall determine whether a certificate of authorization or
airworthiness certification is required for the operation of an UAS. Finally, Section 333(c)
provides that the "Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such
aircraft systems in the" NAS. As noted above, the FAA has previously found that UAS
substantially similar to the AV-900 meet the requirements of Section 333 and
accordingly has granted exemptions from the regulations at issue in this petition.

    2. How AirGon meets the criteria laid forth in Section 333.

     Below are the criteria laid forth in Section 333(b) and a detailed description of how
AirGon meets each of these criteria.

         a. Size, Weight, and Speed.

                   The AV-900's airframe weighs 8.85 lbs. and it has a maximum takeoff
weight of 18.08 lbs., when loaded with battery and camera, its diameter is 39.4," and its
height is 19.7". The maximum horizontal speed is 20 mph and the maximum climb and
decent rates are 200 fpm. The AV-900 is a small, lightweight aircraft that operates at
relatively slow speeds and will pose little to no hazard to people or structures on the
ground. Therefore, the size, weight, and speed of the AV-900 make it a considerably

                                                         3
safer alternative to manned, fixed wing or rotary aircraft for aerial imaging and mapping
applications.

         b. Operational Capacity.

                  The primary function of the AV-900 is to collect high resolution/high
accuracy mapping data in support of small area metric mapping operations. High
resolution data generated from the cameras on the AV-900 offer a wide range of
applications including: orthophoto generation, precision asset location, dense point
cloud collection, volumetric analysis, and other related small area mapping tasks. The
sites where AirGon intends to operate are controlled access areas such as quarries,
surface mines, and construction sites during the grubbing and surface preparation
phases. The maximum size is typically less than 556 acres with an average size around
140 acres. The data from these flights will help companies and mine operators
maximize mine yields, and will improve the efficiency of construction site preparation,
which is of great benefit to the economy and to the public.

                  The AV-900 is a vertical take-off and landing system. Therefore, it can be
launched on-site, without need for a runway or transit to and from the site. Once
airborne, the AV-900 will fly at an altitude of 400ft. AGL or less over the designated site.
Prior to the Flight in accordance with the procedures set out in the Operational
Documents, the Pilot in Command ("PIC') sets a designated flight area and flight
parameters to ensure that the AV-900 will remain within the confines of the site, not
exceed a maximum altitude of 400 ft. AGL, and remain within the visual line of sight
("VLOS") of the PIC and Visual Observer ("VO"). In the event of a critical issue such as a
low battery state or loss of data link, the AV-900 will perform a safe landing procedure
or return-to-launch sequence. In addition, the PIC may override the autopilot with
manual control if necessary. Additional information about the operational capacity of
the AV-900, including safety procedures can be found in the attached Operational
Documents. The AV-900's small operational footprint and built-in safety protocols
provide a safer alternative for aerial imaging than manned aircraft and would pose a
minimal hazard to the NAS or the public.

         c. Proximity to Airports/Populated Areas.

                   As noted above, AirGon plans to use the AV-900 to primarily conduct
operations over mining, quarry, and construction sites. All AirGon operations will be
conducted over private, controlled access property. The job sites where AirGon will
operate are typically secured with perimeter fencing and regulated by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and/or the Mine Safety and Health
Administration ("MSHA"). In addition, many of the job sites will likely be in remote or

                                                          4
industrial areas away from populated areas. In the event that one of the job sites are
within 5 NM of an airport, AirGon will take all appropriate safety measures including
obtaining a letter of agreement with the airport's management. By operating at low
altitudes over controlled access, generally remote sites, the AV-900 will pose minimal
risk to the NAS and individuals and property on the ground.

         d. Visual Line of Site ("VLOS").

                   The AV-900 will be flown in accordance with day Visual Flight Rules ("VFR")
and only in Visual Meteorological Conditions ("VMC") during day-light hours. The AV-
900 will operate within 1NM and VLOS of the PIC and the Visual Observer ("VO")

positioned next to the PIC at an altitude of 400 ft. AGL or less. The PIC and VO will be

responsible for ensuring that the AV-900 remains within VLOS at all times. Should the
AV-900 escape VLOS, the PIC will engage the AV-900's safety features to ensure that the
AV-900's flight is safely terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Operational Documents.

    3. The extent of relief sought and reason for seeking relief.

              a. 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates.

                   14 C.F.R. Part 21 Subpart H establishes the requirements for the issuance
of an airworthiness certificate. The FAA has determined that no exemption of this
section is required if a finding is made under the Reform Act that the UAS selected
provides an equivalent level of safety when compared to aircraft normally used for the
same application. The physical characteristics and operational capacity of the AV-900 is
similar to that of UAS aircraft approved in previous exemption requests; therefore, no
exemption is believed to be necessary. However, if the FAA determines that an
exemption is needed, AirGon hereby requests exemption from Part 21, Subpart H.

                   Section 333 authorizes the FAA to exempt a UAS from the requirements of
an airworthiness certificate based on consideration of the following: size, weight, speed,
operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within
VLOS. As noted above, the AV-900 and procedures developed by AirGon are consistent
with all physical and operational conditions established by the FAA. The combination of
the limited operating limitations and the AV-900 lightweight airframe results in a safer
alternative for aerial surveying than currently offered by traditional manned aircraft.

              b. 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.23(a), 61.101(e)(4), 61.113(a) and (b), 61.133(a), 61.315(a):
                   Pilot Qualifications.

                   AirGon seeks exemption from the above regulations to the extent that
they require the PIC of an UAS to have a commercial pilot's license with a current
medical certificate. Section 61.23(a) sets out the operations requiring a medical
certificate and the level of certificate required. Sections 61.113(a) and (b) limit private
pilots to non-commercial operations. Likewise §§ 61.315(a) and 61.101(a) limits light-
sport and recreational pilots, respectively, to non-commercial operations. Section
61.133(a) requires an individual with a commercial pilot's license to be pilot in command
of an aircraft for compensation or hire. All AirGon pilots will be required to have a valid
driver's license in addition to a sport-pilot, recreational, or private pilot certificate and
will complete training in conducting operations using the AV-900. Prior to conducting
operations for AirGon clients all AirGon pilots will be required to demonstrate their
ability to safely operate the AV-900 including performing evasive and emergency
maneuvers and maintaining an appropriate distance from persons, vessels, vehicles, and

                                                        6
structures. All AirGon pilots will also be required to log flight hours and currency in a
manner consistent with 14 C.F.R. § 61.51(b).

                   Given the reduced risks associated with operation of the AV-900 due to its
small, size, operational limitations, and lack of an onboard pilot or passengers, AirGon
operations will achieve an equivalent level of safety by requiring the PIC to possess a
recreational or sport pilot license and a valid driver's license only. Indeed, the FAA has
approved commercial UAS operations by PIC's with a similar level of certification in
previous cases including Exemption 11305.

            c. 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness.

                   14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a) provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft
unless it is in airworthy condition. Should the exemption be granted allowing
commercial operation of the AV-900 without an airworthiness certificate, no standard
will exist for airworthiness of the AV-900. As a result AirGon seeks full exemption from
this regulation.

                   AirGon will achieve an equal level of safety by following the procedures in
the Operational Documents, which contain pre-flight protocol for each flight, safety
checks, and comprehensive maintenance procedures. The FAA has previously approved
exemption from this regulation for other UAS based on the DJI-900, including in
Exemption 11240.

              d. 91.9(b): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.

                   Section 91.9(b) states that no person may operate an aircraft unless there
is a current approved flight manual for the aircraft onboard. The AV-900 has no ability
or place to carry such a flight manual on the aircraft. In addition, the AV-900 is
unmanned and the PIC is located at the ground control station. AirGon therefore seeks
exemption from the requirement to carry the aircraft flight manual onboard. The
equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping the flight manual at the ground
control station where the PIC will have access to it. The FAA has approved operation
under these conditions in Exemptions No. 11062, 11240, and 11305 among others.

              e. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

                   AirGon requests an exemption from § 91.119. Section 91.119 establishes
safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119(c) limits aircraft flying over
areas other than congested areas to an altitude of 500 ft. AGL, except over open water
or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than

                                                             7
500ft. to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. An exemption is required because the
proposed UAS operations will need to occur below 400 ft. AGL. Further, due to the
nature of the proposed operations, the PIC and other flight crew may at times be less
than 500ft. away from the UAS.

                   An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because of the size, weight,
speed, and material of AV-900 and the operational limitations discussed above. All
operations will be conducted with the permission of the property owner, and the PIC will
be able to control the site and ensure that all affected individuals will be aware of the
operations and will stay a safe distance away from operations or under a protective
covering. Any risk associated with AirGon's operations will be significantly less than that
of manned aircraft, which are heavier, must have onboard flight personnel, and must
travel to and from the job site. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the AV-900
will maintain separation between AirGon's operations and the operations of
conventional aircraft that must comply with § 91.119.

              f. 91.121: Altimeter Settings.

                   AirGon seeks exemption from § 91.121, which requires a person operating
an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude or flight level by reference to an altimeter that is
set to the elevation of the departure airport or barometric pressure. The Pixhawk
autopilot on board the AV-900 will have a barometric altimeter, which is automatically
set to 0 when the Return to Launch ("RTL") location of the AV-900 is established just
prior to launch. However, the barometric altimeter will only be used by the autopilot in
two circumstances: (1) the GPS signal is not sufficient to determine the altitude of the
AV-900; or (2) the AV-900 is at an AGL below 33 ft. Therefore, because the barometric
altimeter will not be used directly by the PIC, AirGon seeks exemption to the extent
necessary.

                   An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because, first, the AV-900 will
report GPS AGL altitude to the PIC via radio telemetric feed. Second, as described
above, for situations in which the GPS signal cannot deliver accurate altitude data, the
autopilot will use the barometric altimeter to ensure the AV-900 operates at the proper
altitude. Finally, all operations will be conducted within VLOS and in accordance with
the operational constraints described above.

              g. 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions.

                   Airgon seeks exemption from § 91.151(a), which requires an individual to
ensure that, for a flight in VFR conditions, there is enough fuel to fly for an additional 30
minutes after reaching the first point of intended landing. The nominal flight time for

                                                         8
the AV-900 is 22 minutes; therefore, no flight of the AV-900 would be possible under
this regulation.

                  An equivalent or greater level of safety exists via the safety features
described in the Operational Documents. Specifically, during the flight, the level of
battery power is communicated to the control station via telemetry. In the event of
either loss of telemetry or the battery level falling below 20% capacity, the AV-900 will
automatically return to its launch station. In addition, in the event either of these
features were to fail, the PIC could take control of the AV-900 and safely return it to the
ground. Further, unlike with a manned aircraft, given the size and relative cost of the
AV-900, as well as the fact that it carries no passengers, in an emergency situation the
PIC can sacrifice the AV-900 to protect persons and property.

              h. 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(l), 91.409(a)(l) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b):
                   Maintenance & Inspections.

                  AirGon seeks exemption from §§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(l), 91.409(a)(l) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b). These sections specify maintenance and inspection standards
in reference to 14 C.F.R. Part 43 for aircraft to maintain an airworthiness certificate. The
UAS that AirGon intends to operate will not have an airworthiness certificate and
therefore exemption is needed.

                  AirGon will provide an equivalent level of safety by performing
maintenance and inspections in accordance with the Operational Documents. In
addition, prior to each flight, AirGon pilots will complete the pre-flight checklist,
ensuring that all critical systems of the UAS are functioning properly. The Operational
Documents contain recordkeeping requirements for routine, interval, and post-flight
maintenance. As a whole, the maintenance and inspection procedures set out in the
Operational Documents will ensure that an equivalent or higher level of safety is
achieved, especially when combined with the size and operational limitations of the AV-
900.

    4. How the request benefits the public as a whole.

         The AV-900 is a safe, efficient and economical alternative to the manned aircraft
that are currently being used to conduct aerial imaging of mining, quarry, and
construction operations. There are four major reasons why the public would benefit
from granting AirGon exemptions from these regulations: reducing the burden on Air
Traffic Controllers (ATC), reducing air pollution, reducing the risk to life and property on

                                                            9
the ground, and maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of mme and quarry
operations.

         The AV-900 can take-off and land on-site and operate at an altitude of 400 ft.
AGL or less within VLOS of the PIC; therefore, there is no need for ATC to provide
coordination during ground, take-off, departure, transit, arrival, and landing phases of
flight. Reducing the burden placed on ATC will provide a significant benefit to the
public.

         The AV-900 will reduce pollution. A traditional aircraft must take-off and land at
an airport and therefore must fly to and from the site. The necessity to travel to and
from the site wastes a significant amount of fuel. In contrast, the AV-900 is light weight,
uses electric batteries and motors instead of fuel and internal-combustion engines, and
can be launched and landed on-site. Therefore, the AV-900 will significantly reduce the
fuel and energy consumption needed to perform aerial surveying.

         The small size and relatively low speed of the AV-900 will also reduce the risk to
life and property on the ground. The AV-900 weighs, at maximum 18.07 lbs. and has a
maximum speed of 20 mph. In the event of failure, the AV-900 poses significantly less
risk to persons and property on the ground than manned aircraft which carry flammable
fuel and weigh significantly more than the AV-900. Also, as mentioned above, the AV-
900 will only operate over the job site and will not be required to commute to an
airport. This will all but eliminate the risk to persons and property outside of the job
site.

         Conducting site surveys via UAS also provides significant safety benefits over
conducting surveys using ground-based surveyors. When performing ground-based
surveys, surveyors and support personnel must be intermingled with active mining
equipment. Collecting data via UAS removes personnel from areas with mining
equipment resulting in a significantly lower risk of injury to surveyors and support
personnel.

          Finally, use of the AV-900 will allow mine and quarry operators to obtain accurate
surveys of their sites at a cost significantly less than that of manned operations. As has
been noted above, surveying done by manned aircraft is more expensive, more
dangerous, and less efficient than surveying using UAS technology. In addition, aerial
surveying via UAS is more accurate and safer than ground-based surveying. Ground-
based surveying is especially dangerous on mine and quarry sites as data collection
personnel must operate in the midst of active mining equipment. Therefore, by
granting this exemption mine and quarry operators will be able to obtain more accurate
information about their sites more often than possible under current circumstances.

                                                             10
Thus, mine and quarry operators will be able to more efficiently and economically
conduct their mining operations and maximize yields from their sites. This will reduce
the cost of raw materials, invigorating the markets for these materials. In addition,
maximizing yields will provide significant environmental benefits such as reducing
waste. Similar to the benefits in the mining and quarry fields, aerial UAS surveying of
construction sites in the site preparation phase will reduce site preparation time, and
reduce the overall cost of construction.
