                                                          Exemption No. 11339
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0023

Mr. Bradley Ward
Chief Pilot
Empire Unmanned, LLC
11559 North Atlas Road
Hayden, ID 83835

Dear Mr. Ward:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 6, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Empire Unmanned, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct precision photogrammetry and crop scouting for precision agriculture.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a SenseFlyeBee Ag.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Empire Unmanned, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Empire Unmanned, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the SenseFly eBee Ag
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
    as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
       documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.

Re: Exemption Request Under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the "Reform Act")
and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Empire Unmanned LLC, seeks an exemption from Federal Aviation
Regulations ("FARs") detailed below for the eBee Ag Unmanned Aircraft System manufactured
by SenseFly SA of Switzerland. This application is identical to the application of Advanced
Aviation Solutions LLC, to which you granted Exemption 11136 on 5 January, 2015. With
Advanced Aviation Solutions' cooperation, we have updated the restrictions to match the
additional restrictions of the Grant 11136. To speed processing, all other requests including
those that you deemed unnecessary, remain the same.

The requested exemption would support an application for a commercial Certificate of
Authorization to use the system to support agriculture. The eBee Ag system consists of a
lightweight (1.5 lb) battery operated aircraft, a PC-based ground control station, and associated
communications equipment. The aircraft carries an onboard geo-referenced still camera that
allows it to conduct precision photogrammetry and crop scouting at the resolutions necessary for
precision agriculture. This high-resolution data can direct variable seeding rates as well as the
precise application of fertilizer and chemicals reducing their use. This data helps farmers to
maximize yields while reducing costs and impacts to the environment. By approving these
exemptions, the FAA will create benefits to both agriculture and the environment which are
ultimately in the public interest.1

The aircraft will be operated in the field with both a Pilot in Command (PIC) and a ground-based
Visual Observer (VO) in accordance with FAA Order 8900.1, vol. 16 "Unmanned Aircraft
Systems" with the following additional restrictions:

- All operations will occur in Class G airspace at no more than 400' AGL
- Operations will be operated over private property with the permission of the land owner
- All required permits will be obtained from state and local government prior to operation
- The aircraft will not be operated over urban or populated areas
- The aircraft will not be operated at air shows or over an open-air assembly of people
- The aircraft will not be operated over heavily trafficked roads
- The aircraft will not be operated within 5 NM of an airport or heliport
- Operations will be limited to day, visual meteorological conditions
- Aircraft will remain within Visual Line of Sight at no greater than 1/2 NM of the PIC at all time

1 We will provide an explanation of equivalent level of safety for each exemption request, but will point back to the
benefits to agriculture and the environment to justify why the requests are in the public interest.

                                                                                                                         1 of 6
- While the aircraft is airborne, the VO will be positioned within voice distance to the PIC
- PIC will file a NOTAM providing radial/DME, radius, and a date/time group for each operation

The PIC and VO will meet the requirements outlined in FAA Order 8900.1, volume 16, chapter 4.
The PIC will hold a Private Pilot's Certificate and current Class III medical. Additionally, the
PIC will perform maintenance on the system and will complete a course of maintenance
instruction as part of their initial training. Due to the simplicity of the system, we do not
anticipate the need for a supplemental pilot.

We submit that the combination of the aircraft's light weight, historically demonstrated flight
performance, fully qualified flight crew and strict operation under the guidelines established in
8900.1, the FAA can have confidence that the operation will have an equivalent or greater level
of safety of manned aircraft performing the same mission.

The name and contact information of the applicant are:

Empire Unmanned LLC
Attn: Bradley Ward
Ph: 208-292-3850

The regulations from which the exemption is requested are as follows:

- 14 CFR Part 21
- 14 CFR 91.203
- 14 CFR 45.23, 45.29
- 14 CFR 91.9
- 14 CFR 61.113, 61.133

            EXEMPTION REQUESTS AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Advanced Aviation Solutions requests an exemption from the following regulations as well as
any additional regulations that may technically apply to the operation of the SenseFly eBee Ag:

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates

This part establishes the procedures for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate. While the
FAA continues to work to develop airworthiness standards for UAS, we request an experimental
certificate be issued for the SenseFly eBee Ag under either or both of the following provisions:

         21.191 Experimental certificates.
         Experimental certificates are issued for the following purposes:
         (a) Research and development. Testing new aircraft design concepts, new aircraft
         equipment, new aircraft installations, new aircraft operating techniques, or new
         uses for aircraft.
         (b) Showing compliance with regulations. Conducting flight tests and other
         operations to show compliance with the airworthiness regulations including
         flights to show compliance for issuance of type and supplemental type
         certificates, flights to substantiate major design changes, and flights to show
         compliance with the function and reliability requirements of the regulations.

Since the experimental certificate can be used for commercial purposes such as market surveys,
sales demonstrations, and customer crew training, we would expect that an experimental
certificate would permit our commercial purpose as well.

The aircraft will not carry persons or property, will not carry fuel, and will only fly under strict
operational requirements. Combined with the fact that the aircraft weighs only 1.5 pounds and is
constructed primarily out of foam, we propose that the eBee Ag will be at least as safe, if not
safer, than a conventionally certificated aircraft performing the same mission.

If an experimental airworthiness certificate is not appropriate for this application, then we
request an exemption of 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H, and the requirement for an airworthiness
certificate in general, citing the equivalent level of safety outlined in the previous paragraph.

14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b) Civil aircraft: Certifications required.

The regulation provides that an airworthiness certificate, with the registration number assigned to
the aircraft and a registration certificate must be aboard the aircraft. Additionally, subparagraph
(b) provides that the airworthiness certificate be "displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so
that it is legible to passengers or crew." At 1.5 lbs, the eBee is too small to carry documentation,
does not have an entrance, and is not capable of carrying passengers or crew.

To obtain an equivalent level of safety and meet the intent of 91.203, we propose that documents
deemed appropriate for this aircraft by the FAA will be co-located with the crew at the ground
control station and available for inspection upon request. In order to identify the aircraft, we
propose that the information found on airworthiness and registration certificates be permanently
affixed to the aircraft via placard:

14 CFR 45.23 Display of marks; general and 45.29 Size of marks.

These regulations provide that each aircraft must display "N" and the aircraft's registration
number in letters at least 3 inches high. Additionally, the aircraft must display the word
"EXPERIMENTAL" in letters at least 2 inches high near the entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or
pilot station. The 1.5 pound eBee Ag does not have an entrance in which the word
"EXPERIMENTAL" can be placed, and may not have a registration number assigned to it by the
FAA.

We propose to achieve an equivalent level of safety by including the word "EXPERIMENTAL"
on the top of the aircraft, where the PIC, VO and others in the vicinity of the aircraft while it is
preparing for launch will be able to see the designation. Additionally, we feel that the permanent
placard discussed in the previous paragraph will provide the aircraft's registration information
should it be found on the ground. Finally, we will display at the ground station a high contrast
flag or banner that contains the words "Unmanned Aircraft Ground Station" in letters 3 inches
high or greater. Since the aircraft will operate within 1/2 NM of the ground station, the banner
should be visible to anyone that observes the aircraft and chooses to investigate it's point of
origin.

14 CFR 91.9 Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements.

This regulation provides that no person may operate an aircraft unless a current, approved flight
manual is in the aircraft. We assume that the intent of this requirement is to ensure that flight
manual information is available to the aircrew while operating the aircraft. We request an
exemption to this requirement since the aircraft is not only too small to carry documentation, the
documentation would not be available to the crew.

To obtain an equivalent level of safety and meet the intent of 91.9, we propose that a current,
approved Airplane Flight Manual (appendix E) must be available to the crew at the ground
station anytime the aircraft is in, or preparing for, flight.

14 CFR 61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in Command and 61.133
Commercial pilot privileges and limitations.

The regulation provides that no person that holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in
command of an aircraft for compensation or hire. Subparagraph (b) allows a private pilot to act
as pilot in command of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if: (1) The

                                                                                                                         5 of 7
                                                                                                       Appendix A

flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and (2) The aircraft does not carry
passengers or property for compensation or hire.

Our proposed operations meet the requirements of 8900.227 para 16(c)(2)(c) "Operations
without a pilot certificate" in which the PIC is required to complete "FAA private pilot ground
instruction" and pass "the FAA Private Pilot written examination." Since there are currently no
means available for the pilot of a UAS to gain the experience in an equivalent category and class
in order to apply for a commercial pilot's license, we propose to generate an equivalent level of
safety by requiring our pilots to complete, at a minimum, FAA commercial pilot ground
instruction and pass the FAA Commercial Pilot written examination in addition to completing
the private pilot requirements. Since the aircraft cannot carry passengers or property, we feel we
meet the intent of 61.113 Subparagraph (b) even though the intent of this application is to
conduct a business.

14 CFR 91.109 Flight instruction; Simulated instrument flight and certain flight tests

The regulation provides that "No person may operate a civil aircraft that is being used for flight
instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls." The eBee ground control
station is based on a small hand-held computer and while it does not offer a second set of
"controls", both the student and instructor can, and will, operate the single set of controls
simultaneously. With both student and instructor having "hands-on" the controls during flight,
we feel that this technique meets the intent 91.109 and provides an equivalent level of safety.

14 CFR 91.119 Minimum safe altitudes: General.

The regulation provides that over sparsely populated areas the aircraft cannot be operated closer
than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. Since the aircraft will be operating at a
maximum of 400 feet AGL, we cannot comply with this requirement.

To provide an equivalent level of safety we will only fly over private property with the
permission of the land owner. The land owner will be briefed of the expected route of flight and
the associated risks to persons and property on the ground. We maintain that due to the small
size of the eBee Ag, the hazard to persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures is not comparable to
manned aircraft and should be considered in granting the exemption. (see appendix C section
6.4.1 Consideration about risks related to ground impacts)

The aircraft will not be operated over congested areas nor over any open air assembly of persons.
The aircraft will be operated at an altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landing
without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface.

14 CFR 91.121 Altimeter settings.

The regulation provides that aircraft shall maintain cruising altitudes by reference to an altimeter
setting available within 100 nautical miles of the aircraft. The aircraft will fly below 400 feet
AGL and will not need to maintain hemispherical cruising altitudes in order to de-conflict with
other aircraft. As such, an appropriate altimeter measurement presented to the pilot should be
Above Ground Level and should be based on the barometric pressure at the point of launch. To
provide an equivalent level of safety, the UAS's AGL altimeter will be set to zero on the ground
prior to every flight. Since the aircraft will fly no more than 50 minutes, even rapid changes in
barometric pressure will have limited affect on the safety of the flight.

                                                                                                                         6 of 7
                                                                                                       Appendix A

14 CFR 91.151 Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.
The regulation provides that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under day-VFR
conditions unless there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and to fly after
that for at least 30 minutes. We feel the intention of this paragraph is to provide a reserve of
energy as a safety buffer for go-arounds and other delays to landing.
The eBee Ag is battery operated and the maximum duration of flight from a single battery charge
is 50 minutes. Since the aircraft will never fly more than 1/2 nm from the point of intended
landing, a full battery charge at launch will ensure that we meet the reserve energy requirement
of this paragraph. We request an exemption to the word "fuel" and ask for an equivalent
interpretation with the word "energy".
14 CFR Subpart E (91.401 - 91.417) - Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, and
Alterations
The regulation provides that the operator is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft in
an airworthy condition, including compliance with part 39 and 43. Paragraphs 91.407 and
91.409 require that the aircraft be "approved for return to service by a person authorized under
43.7" after maintenance and inspection. It is our intention that the PIC perform maintenance and
inspection of the aircraft and "be authorized to approve the aircraft for return to service."
As provided in the attached Maintenance Procedures (appendix D), the PIC will ensure that the
aircraft is in an airworthy condition prior to flight and conduct detailed inspections after every 10
hours. Maintenance performed by the PIC is limited to repairing small cracks, replacing a
propeller, and updating software and firmware. All other maintenance will be performed by the
manufacturer. The PIC will document work performed in accordance with 91.417. We feel that
due to the size, construction, and simplicity of the aircraft, the PIC can ensure an equivalent level
of safety.

                                                                                                                         7 of 7
