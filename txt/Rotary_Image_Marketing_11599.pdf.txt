                                                           Exemption No. 11599
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0506

Mr. Christopher Alan Frank
Rotary Image Marketing
9206 Timber Knoll Dr.
College Station, TX 77845

Dear Mr. Frank:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated February 22, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Rotary Image Marketing (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial videography and cinematography to develop community awareness for housing
and business properties.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a Phantom 2 Vision +.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Rotary Image Marketing is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Rotary Image Marketing is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Phantom 2 Vision+
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
              and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those
              who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;

                                       for Rotary Image Marketing

a) Christopher Alan Frank
    9206 Timber Knoll Dr.
    College Station, Texas 77845
    (979) 820-3096
    chrisfrank83 @yahoo.com

b) Request exemption from part 21, subpart Hand Sections 45.23(b), 61.113(a) and (b),
    91.7(a), 91.9(b)(2), 91.1 03(b), 91.109, 91.119, 91.121, 91.151(a), 91.203(a) and (b),
    91.405(a), 91.407(a)(l), 91.409(a)(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) ofTitle 14, Code ofFederal
    Regulations (14 CFR).

c) This exemption would allow Rotary Image Marketing to operate the Phantom 2 vision +

    quad copter unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial videography and
    cinematography to develop community awareness for those parents/students who are
    planning to attend Texas A&M University and individuals, companies that are
    unfamiliar of the geographical layout of the Bryan/College Station area for housing and
    business properties. This exemption would allow Rotary Image Marketing to enhance
    real estate, small or large business, and apartment/condo marketing.

    The extent of each relief requested will be as follows:

    CFR 45.23(b) Display of marks; general

     I request the UAS not to be either a certificated aircraft or a certificated "experimental"
     aircraft. Exemption from display of marks is requested due to its size and airspace that it
    will operate in.

     CFR 61.113(a) and (b) Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command

     As I Chris Frank, currently hold a private rotary certificate with a third-class airmen
     medical certificate and currently a UH-60L PIC for the US Army, I understand the
     importance to be knowledgeable of the National Airspace System (NAS). However, I
     request that a non certificated pilot be able to operate the UAS with direct and written
     discretion of a certificated pilot with proper ground, operation and airspace training that
     is established by that certificated pilot. This appointed pilot would be tested in aircraft
     operation, maintenance, emergency procedures and the NAS before assuming operation
of the UAS. A proper training program will be in place with documentation and training
logs.

CFR 91.7(a) Civil aircraft airworthiness

Given that the UAS will not require an airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14
CFR part 21, I request exemption. Also, there is no FAA regulatory standard for
determining the airworthiness of an UAS. The manufacturers operating documents will
be used by the operator to determine if the UAS is airworthy.

CFR 91.9(b)(2) Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements

Followed by exemption :from CFR 45.23(b). Manufacturers operating manual shall be
used and kept by the operator on location ofUAS operations

CFR 91.103(b) Preflight action

While there is no approved airplane or rotorcraft flight manual available for the UAS the
manufacturers operating manual is requested to be used for proper preflight. Runways
and airports will not be used to deploy or recover the UAS excluding them :from the
preflight/planning action.

CFR 91.109 Flight introduction; simulated instrument and certain flight tests

Although the UAS does not allow operation with a dual set of controls, proper hands on
training ofUAS operation will be given to any operational pilot by a certificated pilot
who has sufficient UAS operation hours. Simulated training may be used for sufficient
operational training. All pilots will be familiar with preflight actions, routine flight
operations, and emergency procedures.

CFR 91.119 Minimum safe altitudes: general

Notification of all residing tenets on which property the UAS is intended to operate on
will be coordinated in advance. Tenets will be aware of the exact time and area that the
UAS will be operating in.

CFR 91.121 Altimeter settings

The UAS operator will maintain a GPS that will have derived altitude capabilities to
report feet AGL. Altitudes to be flown will be reported to local ATC before flight.
CFR 91.151(a) Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

The UAS operator will land the UAS prior to the manufacturer's recommended minimum
level of battery power of 30%. The UAS shows a low voltage warning when 30% battery
life is remaining. This provides ample time for the UAS operator to land in an immediate
safe area. Also, the UAS is equipped with an automated function that lands the aircraft
immediately when a low battery is detected.

CFR 91.203(a) and (b) Civil aircraft: certification required

Operations ofthe UAS prove to be above safety standards due to its size, weight, speed,
and limited operating area that it will be operated in

CFR 91.405(a) Maintenance required

This only applies to aircraft with airworthiness certificates. Maintenance of the UAS will
be performed by the operator if a discrepancy is found during pre-flight and recorded on
a "Maintenance Log" for personal history records.

CFR 91.407(a)(l) Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,
or alteration

This only applies to aircraft with airworthiness certificates. Maintenance test flights will
be performed after each maintenance discrepancy is corrected as a safety precaution and
recorded on a "Maintenance Test Flight Log" for personal history records.

CFR 91.409(a)(l) and (2) Inspections

This only applies to aircraft with airworthiness certificates. Pre-flight will be performed
as a safety precaution by the operator using the outlined procedures in the operating
documents.

CFR 91.417(a) and (b) Maintenance records

This only applies to aircraft with airworthiness certificates. Any maintenance performed
on the UAS will be recorded on a "Maintenance Log" for personal history records
d) The UAS operations would provide more detailed and adequate information to potential
    individuals, companies looking to relocate to the Bryan/College Station area and promote
    economic growth overall. Also, the aerial videography would allow small business
    owners a more feasible option for marketing and advertisement over the high cost of
    manned rotary/fixed wing aircraft as in the past. Further, the UAS operation increases the
    safety of patrons due to its small size and lack of combustible fuel over compared to a
    large manned aircraft and reduces the ambient noise level helping to prevent noise
    complaints. Lastly, the UAS proves to be more ecological by emitting no exhaust fumes
    and requires no fossil fuels for operations.

e) UAS operations will not reduce the safety of other airborne pilots, operating pilots, or
    patrons that are in an area ofUAS operation. Conversely, the UAS increases safety as it
    reduces flight operations by rotary wing aircraft flying at low levels while conducting
    videography operations which are conducive to a pilot becoming over task saturated and
    not recognize other flight dangers enabling them into a dangerous situation. Additionally
    the UAS size, weight, and speed do not pose a threat to the public or users of the NAS.

f) (1) Rotary Image Marketing request exemption from the requirements of part 21, subpart
    Hand Sections 45.23(b), 61.113(a) and (b), 91.7(a), 91.9(b)(2), 91.103(b), 91.109,
    91.119, 91.121, 91.151(a), 91.203(a) and (b), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(2), and
    91.417(a) and (b) ofTitle 14, Code ofFederal Regulations (14 CFR).

    (2) This exemption will permit Rotary Image Marketing to operate an Unmanned Aircraft
    System (UAS) for the purpose of conducting real estate and business videography and
    cinematography throughout the Bryan/College Station area to provide a more feasible
    and safer option for real estate and small business owners advertising and marketing.

g) Supporting operating documents are attached.

Rotary Image Marketing  22 Feb 2015

To whom it may concern,

         We are submitting this Petition of Exemption for the purpose of allowing
businesses the financial ability to use videography and cinematography as a marketing
tool for their business, property, and or house. Also, to showcase land and housing
options for newcomers to the Bryan/ College Station area who may be unfamiliar to its
geography My wife Jeanie Frank, is currently a real estate agent in the Bryan/College
Station, Texas area and understands the needs of the local businesses and people. She
works for United Country Real Estate which works largely in auction homes, large plots
ofland, and homes with land acreage attached. She has developed the knowledge of how
to market homes from photography resources but clearly understands the effectiveness in
the video marketing power that a drone can provide for properties and housing.

         I myself am working on acquiring my real estate license to better understand and
serve the people with a great service. I also currently am employed as an Airport
Operations Manager at Easterwood Airport which is located in College Station, Texas. In
my duties, it is my job to comply with FAA requirements as a Part 139 airport and be in
compliance with all FAA procedures as well. I understand the notification process that
drones need to take with the local airports and I currently issue NOTAMS for the airport
and local airspace. Additionally, I currently serve in the United States Army Reserve as
153D UH-60A/L Blackhawk Pilot. I have served in the military for 13 years and as a
pilot for the last 5 years. I have over 500hrs of multi-turbine engine rotary time and serve
as a Pilot In Command (PIC).

         I write this letter hoping to show that our experience allows us to realize,
understand and respect the very issues that the FAA is facing with drones for commercial
use. Our years of experience and knowledge make us more heightened and aware of the
obstacles that lie ahead but make us respect the process. As aviation enthusiast, we look
forward to developing the UAS into the marketing world.

3.2 Built-in Flight Control System

The Phantom 2 Vision+ is equipped with a DJI Naza-M V2 Flight Control System. This provides incredible ease of use
and stability. Pilots can control the Phantom's movements in many directions, including pitch (!onwards and backwards),
roll (left and right), elevator (up and down) and yaw (turn left or right). The flight control system also can provide IOC,
Failsafe and battery level warnings.

Modules                                                                         Furictior:is
Flight Controller
IMU                    Acts as the brains of the complete flight control system, responsible for connecting and
GPS & Compass          controlling all the modules together.
LED Flight Indicators
                       Has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both attitude and
                       altitude.

                       The compass reads geomagnetic information and assists the GPS (Global Position System)
                       to accurately calculate the position and height of the aircraft.

                       Indicates the status of flight control system.

FC Assistant Port
The flight control system communicates with the PC Assistant through a Micro-USB cable between the Phantom FC
Assistant Port and the PC. Users can use Assistant to configure the aircraft and upgrade the Phantom firmware. Please
refer to Using the Phantom 2 Vision+ Assistant (Page 46) for details.

Micro-SO Slot

With flight battery powered off, make sure the Micro-SO
card is inserted correctly into the Micro-SO Slot before
taking any photos or recording any video.

The Phantom 2 Vision+ comes with a 4GB Micro-SO card                                                              Figure 15
and can support cards up to 32GB. The DJI VISION App
may not be able to read some Micro-SO cards. Using
the DJI VISION App to reformat new Micro-SO cards is
recommended.
Refer to Format Micro-SO Card (Page 37) for details.

0 Do not insert or remove Micro-SO card when flight battery i~ powered on.

Gimbal Error Warnings

Before the aircraft takes off, if a gimbal motor error is detected or the gimbal clamp is not removed, there will be a
warning prompt on the camera page of the DJI VISION App. This will disappear after the problem is resolved.

Built-in LiPo Battery: The remote controller includes a rechargeable LiPo battery with           ·~·*
a capacity of 2000mAh. You can monitor the current battery level using the LED
indicators on the front panel of the remote controller as the figure shown:                      25% 50% 75% 100%

& The remote controller will show a blinking LED and sound an alert when the voltage drops below 3.45V, then

         automatically power off after 3 seconds. This process will repeat even if you power cycle the remote controller. If
         this low voltage warning occurs during flight. the remote controller will automatically power off, causing the aircraft
         to enter Failsafe mode, which cannot be interrupted (refer to Failsafe Function (Page27) for details). It is strongly
         recommended that you recharge the battery immediately when the 3.45V-3.5V low voltage warning occurs.

5.5 Antenna Orientation

Keep the antennas pointing skyward, perpendicular to the ground for maximum remote controller range during flight.
