                                                           Exemption No. 11451
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0234

Mr. Michael A. Mang
Vice President
Butler, Fairman and Seufert, Inc.
8450 Westfield Boulevard, Suite 300
Indianapolis, IN 46240

Dear Mr. Mang:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated January 29, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Butler, Fairman and Seufert, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial inspection, environmental monitoring, construction monitoring, and
preliminary engineering report related imagery for civil engineering projects.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21 and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Butler, Fairman and Seufert, Inc. is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Butler, Fairman and Seufert, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
    permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

Dear Sir or Madam: 
 
Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the  
"Reform Act") and 14 C.F.R. as noted above, Butler, Fairman and Seufert Inc. ("BF&S" or  
"Petitioner") hereby submits this petition for exemption to authorize civil operations of small 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUAS") for the purposes of aerial inspection, environmental monitoring, 
construction monitoring and preliminary engineering report related imagery for civil engineering related 
projects. Including private properties and public properties owned by State or Local governments within 
the Continental United States. As a fullservice civil engineering firm BF&S proposes to directly operate 
sUAS for commercial operation by employees and contractors as a value added benefit for civil 
engineering related projects. 
 
This petition is, in most regards, similar to granted exemption No. 11138 both in operational approach 
(closer than 500') and equipment being utilized (DJI Phantom 2 ). 
 
Applicant name and address is:

Public Interest 
 
BF&S was incorporated in 1961 and is a multifaceted Civil Engineering firm with an emphasis on 
transportation and related infrastructure.  BF&S has multiple offices in Indiana and works with 
communities throughout Indiana and surrounding states.  Currently there are over 140 employees with 
various disciplines and professional licenses providing services in core areas including airport design and 
inspection, asset management, bridges, construction inspection, environmental services, GIS, MS4, 
greenways/streetscapes, historic architecture, landscape architecture, land use planning, parks, rightof
way services, roadways/highways, site development, survey, trails, water & wastewater. 
 
The granting of this exemption request would provide State and Local officials (our clients), engineers 
and environmental scientists with highresolution imagery of infrastructure and equipment, including 
roadway, bridges, airports, elevated water tanks, water/wastewater treatment facilities and storm 
water management. Such sUAS operation will provide safety enhancements in and around surrounding 
areas and increase efficiency and reliability of inspections and investigations.  The use of sUAS will 
reduce the risk of inspections by reducing the need for human inspection by personnel on permanent 
and temporary elevated structures currently being performed by bucket trucks, lifts, and ladders. 
Reduce needs for boating or on water activities. It would also reduce personnel time in vehicle traffic 
and reduce maintenance of traffic activities. sUAS operation will improve efficiency and reliability of 
inspections by allowing for higher quality inspections which serve the public interest and provide a new 
level of detail and transparency to public projects.  
 
Additionally, BF&S uses for the sUAS have safety benefits that include reducing the danger and 
emissions associated with full size aircraft. sUAS have no fuel to ignite or explode, and no crew adds a 
greater degree of flexibility. The sUAS further minimizes ecological and ground safety issues to the 
general public and property owners.  
 
Proposed Location Areas 
 
BF&S has years of experience in working with the FAA on airport construction and rehabilitation projects 
and realizes that regulations are needed to protect the National Airspace System (NAS). We also do not 
wish to create any new burdens on existing FAA processes and facilities. Our sUAS area of use will be 
broad and that each project location has different requirements in terms of the NAS. The operation 
location areas have been designated as follows:  
 

    1. Airport property (limited basis) 
    2. Airport property to five miles out 
    3. Populated areas and Public RightofWay  

         (Populated areas are determined by yellow areas on VFR Sectional Aeronautical Charts or as 
         determined by local public safety officials.)    
    4. Uncontrolled Airspace/Private Property 
    5. Municipally/locally owned utilities and structures 
 
With respect to operations on or near airports the following is offered for consideration: 
 

     Unlike proposals by individuals or persons with no aviation knowledge, our firm is uniquely 
         equipped to operate on/near airport property by virtue of our line of business.  BF&S has 
         advanced licensed pilots on staff, with trained individuals that routinely escort contractors in the 
         AOA, as wells as SIDA badged staff, at numerous airports, including commercial airports with 
         Class C airspace.  Collectively, this team knows airports intimately, and can make the call 
         whether a certain sUAS flying scenario makes sense or not and would be able to synthesize with 
         FAA on approaches to integrating sUAS into the NAS. 

     In each case, a COA will be sought, and recommendations/restrictions will be followed. 
     All possible coordination with airport management will take place prior to any operation on or 
         near airport property. 

     All necessary NOTAM's will be coordinated and issued per COA. 

     Operations on airport property will not commence until such time that the PIC has established 
         proficiency by accumulating and logging in a manner consistent with 14 CFR 61.51(b) [as 
         applicable] at least 10 hours flight time as a sUAS pilot with a multirotor sUAS consistent with 
         exemption No. 11062. 

     sUAS operations will be limited to scenarios for which if attempted by normal aircraft, may 
         endanger the pilot, persons, or property and which may create the potential of operating in a 
         condition that may violate FAR's. 

     On airport operations will be sequenced utilizing the N# (submitted for issuance) on the CTAF or 
         with ATCT as appropriate, and shall always begin and terminate outside of any RSA.  
         Communications will be transmitted using a handheld radio capable of operating in the same 
         aviation frequency range and bandwidth as normally utilized by airport department staff during 
         airport inspection projects. 

     BF&S will utilize the strictest rightofway rules and yield to any other manned aircraft that may 
         potentially be in conflict. 

     The pilot being utilized for this type of operation has 8 years airport management experience at 
         a towered airport, is a CFI with MultiEngine and Instrument ratings, and 6 years of experience 
         as listed named responsible party on 77111 Certificates of Waiver or Authorization for annual 
         airshow and R/C events at a FAR 139 airport, and has experience building and flying R/C aircraft.  
         His knowledge and experience will ensure that any COA on or near airport property is executed 
         with due diligence and within the confines of approval. 

 
Proximity 
 
With regard to operating in close proximity, generally operations will be conducted no closer than 500'.  
In instances where, for the purposes of successful data acquisition, a flight closer than 500' is required, 
prior permission will be sought from any owner or oversight entity having jurisdiction.  An example 
would be gathering data and imagery to augment inspection of a bridge, water tower, or other tall 
structure.  Not only will the sUAS be able to capture images not possible in any other way, it removes 
the risk of an individual attempting to climb, or reach areas in need of inspection.  The risks to life 
utilizing sUAS in this manner are far less than conventional methods. 
 
All reasonable precautions will be considered and integrated into the flight plan to ensure the safety of 
persons and property, and shall immediately cease should any barrier to safe operations be 
encountered. 
 
All reasonable precautions will be taken to ensure safety of nonparticipating persons.  In cases where 
barriers or structures can be used, or operations conducted such that in a crash event, persons and 
property will be shielded from any debris, the operation will be approached in that manner. 
 
Any flight that is compromised by an unauthorized person shall be immediately terminated until the 
breach is clear and precautions are taken to prevent further inadvertent entry. 
 
 

          
Small Unmanned Aircraft System  
 
BF&S will utilize the DJI Phantom 2 Quadcopter for all locations, areas and operations specified  herein. 
The Phantom 2 sUASs have a maximum takeoff weight of less than 7 pounds, the flight speed will not 
exceed 35 miles per hour, and it will not be flown at an altitude that exceeds 400 feet AGL. All flights will 
be flown in such a way that they can be safely terminated with a reserve battery power of 25% of the 
battery's maximum charge. The DJI Phantom 2 sUAS does not carry any flammable propellant or fuel. 
The Phantom 2 sUAS also has an integrated GPS system that calculates the sUAS's position and height 
and relays that information via a secure connection back to ground control station.  The onboard flight 
computer also can receive signals for flight controls from the ground control station. An onboard 
camera capable of capturing imagery in the form of full color, high definition still photos and video that 
will also be transmitted back to the ground control station. Additionally, the Phantom 2 sUAS contains 
gyro stabilized flight mode, GPS aided navigation, a compass, blinking LED's on the bottom, a failsafe 
mode if its connection to the remote control is lost, and the system permits the sUAS to return to a 
predetermined location and land without injury or damage. For additional safety, the Phantom 2 will be 
retrofitted with prop guards. The Phantom 2 will be identified by serial number, registered as a public 
aircraft and have identification (NNumber) markings with markings as large as practicable per guidance 
of UAS Integration Office, AFS80, at minimum 1 inch tall on all four sides of the main body.   
 
A transportable Ground Control Station will be utilized in the sUAS.  The Ground Control Station will be a 
BF&S identifiable vehicle or trailer equipped with lighted beacons, strobes and horns capable of being 
seen and heard from 500 feet away. The vehicle or trailer will be stationary during all flight operations. 
The vehicle will carry temporary construction style signs for warning motorists of drone survey 
operations, ground wind speed indicators, as well as all OSHA required safety equipment relating to 
surveying and construction inspection related operations. All flight control equipment, documentation, 
the Pilot in Command (PIC) and Visual Observer (VO) will be incorporated into the Ground Control 
Station. 
 
BF&S will carry out maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in accordance with the 
operator's manual. Maintenance, inspection, and alterations will be noted in the aircraft log, including 
total flight hours, description of work accomplished, and the signature of the authorized sUAS technician 
returning the sUAS to service. 
 
Unmanned Aircraft Pilot in Command (PIC) 
 
For uncontrolled airspace or private property the PIC will possess a private pilot certificate and a current 
thirdclass medical certificate. For all other airspaces the PIC will possess a commercial pilot certificate 
and a current first or second class medical certificate. Additionally, all pilots will be assisted by a visual 
safety observer, who will communicate verbally with the PIC at all times.  
 
The sUAS will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times. The PIC shall use 
human vision unaided by any device other than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAAissued 
medical certificate. 
 
The PIC must have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51 (b), a minimum 
of five hours as sUAS pilot operating the make and model of sUAS to be utilized for operations under the 
exemption and three takeoffs and three landings in the preceding 90 days. Training will be conducted 
per manufacturer's recommendations to ensure proficiency and  experiencebuilding, to include normal 
and emergency maneuvers, and takeoff and landing.  
 
Unmanned Aircraft Operation 
 
Prior to each flight the PIC will inspect the sUAS to ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the 
inspection reveals any issues that affect the safe operation of the sUAS, the aircraft will not be operated 
until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the sUAS is found to be safe for flight. The 
Ground Control Station, will be included in the preflight inspection. All maintenance and alterations will 
be properly documented in aircraft records. These documents will be kept at the ground control station, 
and project field office if available. 
 
A Notice to Airman (NOTAM), coordination with local airport management, notices to private 
landowners and local law enforcement officials will be submitted not more than 72 hours in advance, 
but not less than 48 hours prior to all flights. A Plan of Activities will also be sent to the local FSDO with 
jurisdiction over the flight area. These documents will be kept at the Ground Control Station, and project 
field office if available. 
 
Every effort to will be made to keep flight operations from directly over any person or as far away as 
possible, and all flights will remain over the project or construction area.  Construction style signs will be 
temporarily set up to warn vehicles of drone flight in roadway areas. Construction crews in the project 
area will be notified 30 minutes in advance of any flights. Drone flight awareness will also be 
incorporated into project safety meetings.     
 
The Ground Control Station will not move during flight operations. Light beacons and strobes will remain 
on during all flight operations from takeoff to landing. Horns will be sounded during takeoff and landing. 
 
Best safety practices shall be used to reduce public or nonproject related personnel exposure in flight 
areas. Flights will be aborted in the event of unpredicted obstacles, emergencies within the flight area, 
or as directed by local law enforcement agencies.  
 
Right of Way will be yielded to all other flight manned operations and activities at all times. Including 
but not limited to ultralight vehicles, hang gliders, or parachuting or parasailing activities.  
 
Operations will only be conducted during daylight and under visual meteorological conditions. Ground 
wind speeds at the Ground Control Station shall not exceed UA manufacturer's recommendations.  
 
Flights shall be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level (AGL). 
 
The sUAS shall be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC. 
 
Any accidents, or flight operation issues will be reported to the appropriate FAA office within 24 hours. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary 
 
The Butler, Fairman and Seufert Inc. Petition for Exemption pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA 
Modernization Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA) includes 14 C.F.R.  Part 21; 14 C.F.R. Part 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. 
61.113(a)&(b); 91.7(a); 91.9(b) (2); 91.103(b); 91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a)&(b); 
91.405(a); 91.407(a) (1); 91.409(a) (2); 91.417(a)&(b) as found below: 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 21 Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for 
procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1). The size, weight 
and restricted operational capabilities of the Phantom 2 permits exemption from Part 21 because it 
meets (and exceeds) an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act. The FAA is 
authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement under both the Act (49 
U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces of legislation permit the FAA to 
exempt UAS's from the airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the weight, size, speed, 
maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense populations.  
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 45.23(b) Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations 45.22(d), Exhibition, antique, 
and other aircraft:  Special Rules, permits persons to apply to the Administrator for a different marking 
procedure if it is impossible to mark an aircraft per §§45.21 and 45.23 through 45.33.  BF&S is 
requesting an alternate marking for the DJI Phantom 2  Quadcopter registration marks. The DJI Phantom 
2  is a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) Quadcopter that cannot comply with the aircraft marking 
standards per §§45.21 and 45.23 through 45.33.  The achievement of equivalent level of safety for the 
Phantom 2 as that it will be identified by serial number, registered and have identification (NNumber) 
markings with markings as large as practicable per guidance of UAS Integration Office, AFS80, minimum 
1 inch tall on all four sides of the main body.   The request was submitted on January 28, 2015. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 61.113(a)&(b) relief is requested since limitations state that a private pilot may, 
for compensation or hire, act as PIC of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if (1)  
The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and (2) The aircraft does not carry 
passengers or property for compensation or hire.  BF&S proposes an equivalent level of safety in that a 
PIC with a private license will operate the sUAS for hire in the locations where a private license is 
sufficient (i.e. private property not in the vicinity of an airport) which may be the majority of the time, 
not just incidentally.  The proficiency of the sUAS pilot with a private license versus a commercial license 
does not correlate with operating a sUAS in the NAS.  BF&S contends an equivalent level of safety will be 
maintained because no PIC will be allowed to operate the Phantom 2 unless the PIC has demonstrated, 
through ongoing training and currency requirements that the PIC is able to safely operate in a manner 
consistent with applicable rules and operating criteria for that specific sUAS.   
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness 
certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the FARs, this 
Regulation does not apply. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.9(b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no pilots 
on board,  or passengers, and no cockpit, and given the size of the sUAS, this Regulation is not 
applicable. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.103(b) prescribes that a pilot shall for any flight, become familiar with runway 
lengths at airports of intended use, and takeoff and landing distance information.  Reference Exemption 
No. 11138 for reason why exemption is not necessary. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.109  Flight instruction; Simulated instrument flight and certain flight tests.   
Reference Exemption No. 11138 for reason why exemption is not necessary. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.119 Minimum safe altitudes.  With regard to operating in close proximity, 
generally operations will be conducted no closer than 500'.  In instances where, for the purposes of 
successful data acquisition, a flight closer than 500' is required, prior permission will be sought from any 
owner or oversight entity having jurisdiction.  An example would be gathering data and imagery to 
augment inspection of a bridge, water tower, or other tall structure.  Not only will the sUAS be able to 
capture images not possible in any other way, it removes the risk of an individual or crew attempting to 
climb, or reach areas in need of inspection.  The risks to life utilizing sUAS in this manner are far less 
than conventional methods. All reasonable precautions will be considered and integrated into the flight 
plan to ensure the safety of persons and property, and shall immediately cease should any barrier to 
safe operations be encountered.  All reasonable precautions will be taken to ensure safety of non
participating persons.  In cases where barriers or structures can be used, or operations conducted such 
that in a crash event, persons and property will be shielded from any debris, the operation will be 
approached in that manner. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.121 Altimeter Settings.   BF&S will set the altimeter to zero feet AGL rather 
than local barometric pressure or field altitude before flight. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.151(a) Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.  Prior UASspecific relief 
has been granted in Exemption Nos. 8811, 10808, and 10673 for daytime, VFR conditions.  To achieve an 
equivalent level of safety, BF&S proposes flying the Phantom 2 per the operating manual leaving ample 
power to safely conclude the flight with power remaining, even auto land when a low battery is 
detected. 
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.203(a)&(b) Civil aircraft: Certifications required. BF&S requests relief from the 
requirement of Section 91.203(a) (i.e., that an appropriate and current airworthiness certificate and an 
effective U.S. registration certificate be carried within the aircraft), and further, BF&S requests relief 
from the requirement of Section 91.203(b) (i.e., that the airworthiness certificate be displayed at the 
cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew).  As the DJI Phantom 2 sUAS is 
unmanned, it has no cabin, cockpit, pilot station, or entrances thereto.  Therefore, the aircrew member 
is located at a ground control station and no passengers are carried at any time.  As such, BF&S proposes 
the following conditions and limitations to its request for exemption from Sections 91.203(a) and (b):  
The documents required by Sections 91.203(a) and (b) must be kept at the ground control station, 
where it is immediately available to the aircrew member (pilot in command) of the DJI Phantom 2 sUAS 
any time the unmanned aircraft is operating.  The documents required by 91.203(a) and (b) will be made 
available within 10 days to any FAA, U.S. Department of Defense, or law enforcement official upon 
request.    
 
Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.405(a) Maintenance required, and Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.407(a) (1) 
Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration, and Respecting 14 CFR 
Part 91.409(a) (1) and (2) Inspections, and Respecting 14 CFR Part 91.417(a)&(b) Maintenance records. 
As noted previously, BF&S will carry out maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote control and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control system

connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more

information.

1.2 Connections with Other DJI Products

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G Wi-Fi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
          updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
          while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote control's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range

during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Control Operation

  The operations of remote control are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote control are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote control is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

Control    nose direction
(Mode 2)                                  The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                                          Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                          Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                          The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                                          altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                          Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                          position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                                          suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                          prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                          elevation changes.

                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                                      clock-wise.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      forward.
                                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                                      stick is centered.
                                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                                      faster flight velocity.
                                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                                      centered.
                                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in
                                                      a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote control and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

A                                         BC          D

                                          Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote control.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Control Operation> for

      more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 |
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
          4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote control is lost. The flight control system
will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote control and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote control is powered off.
2 The remote control is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must have

        been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote control.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the aircraft, essentially reducing

        the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 |
Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures

1 Record Home Point.                       2 Flying.                                         3 Remote controller signal lost.

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
        will descend automatically.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
control from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position as
a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks on
the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:
1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is

        recorded last time.
2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

                      distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote control's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,
                      make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.
