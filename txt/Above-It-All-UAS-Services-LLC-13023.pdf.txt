                                                           Exemption No. 13023
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2882

Mr. Thomas E. Dolan
Founder & Operations Officer
Above It All ­ UAS Services, LLC
30 Industrial Drive, Suite 1B
Louisa, VA 23093

Dear Mr. Dolan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Above It All ­ UAS Services, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct precision aerial surveys that consist of still, video images and corresponding data
taken by onboard cameras and/or sensors.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom, DJI Phantom 2 Vision +, and the
DJI S-1000.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Above It All ­ UAS Services, LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Above It All ­ UAS Services, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom, DJI
    Phantom 2 Vision +, and the DJI S-1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds
    including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
    petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
                                                                                                            4

    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

Re: Exemption Request under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the
    Federal Aviation Regulations

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and 14 CFR
Part 11, Above It All ­ UAS Services, LLC the Applicant of the DJI Phantom
(PHANTOM), DJI Phantom 2 Vision + (PHANTOM 2) and DJI S-1000 ("S-1000")
Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("SUAS") , seeks an exemption from the Federal
Aviation Regulations ("FARs") discussed later in this petition.

The requested exemption would allow commercial operation of Applicants PHANTOM,
PHANTOM 2 and S-1000 SUAS' of which all weigh under 25 lbs. (based on variable
installed sensors) to perform precision aerial surveys that consist of still, video images
and corresponding data taken by onboard cameras and/or sensors. The PHANTOM,
PHANTOM 2 and S-1000 SUAS' takes a series of high quality, still digital images, video
images and or other data that are used to provide inspection data for evaluation by a
client. Applications for these SUAS devices and associated data processing functions
include inspection of; agriculture; building; travel & power utility infrastructure;
professional surveying; real estate; law enforcement; Electronic News Gathering (ENG);
television; movie filming; radiological & consequence management and scientific
research & development.

Use of the PHANTOM, PHANTOM 2 and S-1000 SUAS' for the aerial missions
aforementioned reduces the need to operate conventional airplanes or helicopters for the
same purpose thus reducing risk to personnel and property on the ground. High quality
imagery/data can be provided at a fraction of the cost of using conventional manned
aircraft. The benefits from these savings will be enhanced efficiency, productivity for the
affected activities, as well as reduction in harmful environmental emissions and safety
risks. Operations under the exemption will be subject to strict operating requirements and
conditions to ensure at least an equivalent level of safety to currently authorized
operations using manned aircraft and under conditions as may be modified by the FAA as
required by Section 333.

       REGARDING THE FAA 333 EXEMPTION PETITION REQUEST FROM:
                                 Above It All ­ UAS Services, LLC
                                                     2
The PHANTOM, PHANTOM 2 and S-1000 SUAS' will be operated under controlled
conditions at low altitude in airspace that is limited in scope, as described more fully
herein; it will have automated control features, as described below. The PHANTOM,
PHANTOM 2 and S-1000 SUAS' also will be operated and observed by a individuals
who posses an FAA commercial or private pilots license that already understand the
rigorous requirements of flying manned airplanes and/or rotorcrafts in the National
Airspace System (NAS). Any required manufacturer's training, certification and/or exam
programs for the SUAS if any will also be obtained by the applicant's SUAS team
members.

Finally, the airspace in which the SUAS' will operate will be below 400 feet above
ground level, over privately owned, owner authorized land. Applicant respectfully
submits that because these small, unmanned aerial vehicles, the PHANTOM,
PHANTOM 2 and S-1000 SUAS', will be used in lieu of comparatively hazardous
operations now conducted with fixed wing, and rotary conventional aircraft, the FAA can
have confidence that the operations will achieve at least an equivalent level or greater
level of safety. Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the
Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's) responsibilities under Section
333(c) of the Reform Act to establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems in the NAS.

V THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD UNDER SECTION 333

Developer submits that grant of this exemption application for use of the PHANTOM,
PHANTOM 2 VISION + and S-1000 SUAS' in a wide-range of various low level aerial
missions & applications that will advance the Congressional mandate in Section 333 of the
Reform Act to accelerate the introduction of UAS's into the NAS if it can be accomplished
safely. This law directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether certain UAS's
may operate safely in the NAS before completion of the rulemaking required under Section
332 of the Reform Act. In making this determination, the Secretary is required to determine
which types of UAS's do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a
threat to national security in light of the following:

         · The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;

         · Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and

         · Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.

Reform Act § 333(a) (1) If the Secretary determines that such vehicles "may operate safely
in the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe
operation of such aircraft in the national airspace system." Id. §333(c)

Petitioner submits that this provision places a duty on the Administrator to not only process
applications for exemptions under Section 333, but for the Administrator, if he deems the
conditions proposed herein require modification in order to allow approval, to supply
conditions for the safe operation of the UAS. Developer welcomes the opportunity to
consult with FAA staff in order to address any issues or concerns that this proposal may
raise that they believe may require modification.

               Above It All ­UAS Services, LLC - FAA 333 Exemption Request

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority, by its terms, includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined
under §40101 of the Act, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current
airworthiness certificate and those regulations requiring commercial pilots to operate
aircraft in commercial service:

         The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation
         prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any of sections 4-44702-
         44716 of this title if the Administrator finds the exemption is in the public interest.

49 U.S.C. §44701(f) See also 49 USC §44711(a); 49 USC §44704; 14 CFR §91.203(a) (1)

The grant of the requested exemption is in the public interest based on the clear direction in
Section 333 of the Reform Act; the additional authority in the Federal Aviation Act, as
amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations; and
the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety and cost savings associated with
transitioning to UAS's for aerial applications and use of its associated data processing
functions to include inspection of; agriculture; building; travel & power utility
infrastructure, professional surveying, real estate, law enforcement, Electronic News
Gathering (ENG), television, movie filming, radiological & consequence management and
scientific research & development. Accordingly, the Petitioner respectfully requests that
the FAA grant the requested exemption upon review of request.

VI DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED OPERATIONS & SUAS'

The current PHANTOM, PHANTOM 2 VISION + and S-1000 SUAS' Manual describes,
in detail, the policies and procedures for Petitioners proposed SUAS operations. To assist
the FAA in its safety assessment of Petitioners proposed SUAS operations, below is a
summary of operational limitations and conditions which will ensure an equivalent or
higher level of safety to operations conducted under current regulatory guidelines:

    1. The SUAS' will weigh less than 25 lbs. depending on sensor requirements.

    2. Flights will be operated within line-of-sight of the trained PIC and PO.
    3. Flights will be terminated at 25% power reserve.

    4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.

    5. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the SUAS PIC and PO.

    6. The SUAS PIC and PO will both be FAA licensed commercial or private pilot.

                                                 3 Revised 6/9/2015
          Above It All ­UAS Services, LLC - FAA 333 Exemption Request

7. The SUAS pilot will be PIC. The PIC and PO, both being FAA pilot certificate
    holders have the ability to and may take over each others role for safety or any other
    reason due to both having the same and necessary PIC/PO qualifications & training,
    which adds to the overall safety of flight operations.

8. The SUAS will only operate within a limited pre-determined area.
9. The SUAS onboard computer stabilization controller provides the PIC the ability to

    hover the SUAS and move in vertical and horizontal planes independently and
    simultaneously that affords the PIC to alter predetermined flight path if any safety
    issue in flight path arises.
10. The SUAS onboard telemetry affords the PIC to monitor in real time all pertinent
    SUAS airborne altitude, battery life, GPS system health data and parameters on
    laptop or tablet.
11. If the SUAS loses communications or GPS signal the SUAS will automatically
    return to its pre-determined safe launching/landing site through its advanced
    onboard safety feature.
12. A mandatory preflight safety briefing for all SUAS team personnel will be
    conducted prior to each day's planned SUAS flight missions.
13. PIC and PO will have the most current training in the SUAS to be operated along
    with any pertinent information from the manufacturer, as required in the Manual.
14. PO and PIC will at all times be able to communicate by voice, visual signal, audible
    signal and/or text.
15. Permission, Written or oral, will be obtained from the necessary property owners or
    managers prior to any aerial activity.
16. Any and all required permissions and/or permits will be obtained from the
    appropriate state, county, city or jurisdiction agencies prior to any aerial activity.
17. Petitioner will submit a Certificate of Authorization (COA) application for each
    SUAS as part of the exemption sought by this Petition

VII REGULATIONS FROM WHICH EXEMPTION IS REQUESTED

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions.
By its terms, this statutory authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined
under §40101 of the Act, including SUASs, from its safety regulations and minimum
standards when the Administrator decides a requested exemption is in the public interest.

Petitioner seeks an exemption from several interrelated provisions of 14 CFR Parts 21,
45 and 91 for purposes of conducting wide-range of various low level aerial missions &
applications with associated data processing functions to include inspection of; agriculture;
building; travel & power utility infrastructure; professional surveying; real estate; law
enforcement; Electronic News Gathering (ENG); television; movie filming; radiological &
consequence management and scientific research & development using SUAS which are
listed below are:

         (1) the specific sections of 14 CFR for which exemption is sought; and
         (2) the operating procedures and safeguards that Petitioner has established which
         will ensure a level of safety equal to or better than the rules from which exemption
         is sought.

A. 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H Airworthiness Certificates & 14 CFR § 91.203(a) (1).

This petition seeks an exemption from 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H, which establishes the
procedural requirements for the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by 14
CFR §91.203(a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area associated with the SUAS to
be utilized by the Petitioner, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements
of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the Reform Act.

The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701(f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both
authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate,
upon consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to
airports and populated areas of the particular UAS.

In all cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the SUAS operated without an
airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed
will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional rotorcraft operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions of the proposed SUAS
operations.

Equivalent Level of Safety

The SUAS to be operated hereunder is less than 25 lbs. fully loaded, carries no pilot,
No passenger, no explosive materials, and operates exclusively within a secured pre-
determined area. Unlike other civil aircraft, the proposed operations in this petition for
exemption will be controlled and monitored by the Petitioner with advance notice to the
FAA of all operations that will be conducted under this exemption.

                                                 8 Revised 6/9/2015
               Above It All ­UAS Services, LLC - FAA 333 Exemption Request

These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in connection
with existing inspection operations, provide a greater degree of safety to the public and
property owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates
issued under 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria
demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security posed by the SUAS, due to
its size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack of explosive materials, and inability
to carry a substantial external load.

B. 14 CFR Part 27: Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Rotorcraft.

14 CFR Part 27 sets forth the procedural requirements for airworthiness certification of
normal category rotorcraft. To the extent the Petitioner's SUASs would otherwise require
certification under Part 27, as a rotorcraft, Petitioner requests an exemption from Part 27's
airworthiness standards for the same reasons identified in the exemption request from 14
CFR Part 21, Subpart H.

C. Aircraft Marking and Identification Requirements: 14 CFR §§ 91.9(c), 45.23(b)
and 45.27(a).

This petition seeks an exemption from the aircraft marking and identification requirements
of 14 CFR §§ 91.9(c), 45.23(b) and 45.27(a).

14 CFR § 91.9(c), Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements,
provides that:

No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft unless that aircraft is identified in
accordance with part 45 of this chapter.

14 CFR § 45.23(b), Markings of the Aircraft, states:

When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the registration number is
displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental or
provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near each
entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than
6 inches high, the words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or
"provisional," as applicable

14 CFR § 45.27(a), Rotorcraft, states:

Each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that rotorcraft horizontally on both surfaces of
the cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail the marks required by §45.23.

Exemption from § 45.23(b) is warranted because the SUAS has no entrance to the cabin,

                                                 9 Revised 6/9/2015
               Above It All ­UAS Services, LLC - FAA 333 Exemption Request

cockpit or pilot station, on which the word "Experimental" can be placed. Moreover, given
the size of the SUAS, two-inch lettering would be impossible. The word "Experimental"
will be placed on the fuselage in compliance with § 45.29(f).

Given the nature of the specific relief sought by this exemption request, Petitioner requires
relief from the associated marking and identification requirements of § 45.27(a) and §
91.9(c), which would require compliance with § 45.23(b).

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety for exemptions to the aircraft marking and identification
requirements of §§ 91.9(c), 45.23(b) and 45.27(a), will be provided by having the SUAS
marked on its fuselage as required by §45.29(f) where the PIC, PO, and others working
with the SUAS will see the identification of the UAS as "Experimental." Additionally,
Petitioner will ensure compliance with any requests of SUAS marking by the FAA.

The FAA has issued the following exemptions to the aircraft marking requirements of §
45.23(b): Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

D. 14 CFR § 91.9(b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.

This petition seeks an exemption from the flight manual requirements of 14 CFR §
91.9(b) (2), which states:

         (b) No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft

         (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
         this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved airplane or
         Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
         any combination thereof.

Given its size, configuration, and load capacity, the SUAS has no ability to carry such a
manual on the craft. There is no need to carry this item on the SUAS, since there is no pilot
on board, no room, no capacity or need.

Equivalent Level of Safety

The safety related purpose of this manual requirement can be equally satisfied by
having the SUAS flight manual at the ground control point where the pilot flying the SUAS
will have immediate access to it. Accordingly, Petitioner requests an exemption from §
91.9(b) (2)'s flight manual requirements, on the condition that the SUAS flight manual be
available at the control point during each operation.

The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607,
8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and 10700

               Above It All ­UAS Services, LLC - FAA 333 Exemption Request

E. 14 CFR § 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness.

This petition seeks an exemption from 14 CFR § 91.7(a), which requires that a civil aircraft
be in an airworthy condition to be operated. Since there is currently no airworthiness
certificate issued for the SUAS, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining
airworthiness.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Petitioner PICs have hundreds flight hours in SUAS flying operations with an excellent
safety record. Furthermore, given the size of the SUAS and the requirements contained in
the Manual for maintenance and use of safety checklists prior to each flight, an equivalent
level of safety will be provided.

The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607,
8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and 10700

F. 14 CFR § 91.103(b): Preflight Action

This petition seeks an exemption from m § 91.103, which requires a PIC to become
familiar with specific information before each flight, including information contained in the
FAA approved Flight Manual on board the aircraft. Inasmuch as an FAA approved flight
manual will not be provided for the SUAS, an exemption will be needed.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be provided by following the SUAS Operations Manual
comprehensive preflight checklist. The PIC will attain all information and actions,
including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff distances, and
aircraft performance data, a briefing to the PO along with all others involved in the aerial
activities before beginning any flight operation.

G. 14 CFR § 91.109(a): Flight Instruction.

This petition seeks an exemption from 14 CFR § 91.109(a), which provides that "no person
may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that is being used for flight
instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls." SUAS' and remotely
piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual pilot controls. Instead,
flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box or ground station that
communicates with the SUAS via radio frequency communications.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Given the size and speed of the SUAS, an equivalent level of safe training can still be
performed without dual controls because no pilot or passengers are aboard the SUAS, and
all persons will be a safe distance away should the SUAS experience any difficulties during
flight instruction.

The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training without fully functional dual controls
for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in experimental aircraft. See Exemption
Nos. 5778K & 9862A.

H. 14 CFR § 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

This petition seeks an exemption from the minimum safe altitude requirements of 14 CFR
§ 91.119. Section 91.119 prescribes the minimum safe altitudes under which aircraft may
not operate, including 400 feet above the surface and away from any person, vessel,
vehicle, or structure in non-congested areas. See 14 CFR § 91.119(c). Section § 91.119(d)
(1) allows for a helicopter to operate at less than those minimum altitudes when it can be
operated "without hazard to persons or property on the surface," provided that "each person
operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for
helicopters by the FAA

To provide the intended inspections, the SUAS will normally need to be operated within a
range of approximately 100 feet from the structure or item to be inspected. Accordingly,
due to the nature of the proposed operations, the PIC and the PO may at times be less than
400 feet away from structures during the operation, and an exemption is therefore required.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the UAS as
well as the location where it is operated. Operations with rotorcraft weighting far more than
the maximum 25 lbs. proposed SUAS, along with the lack of flammable fuel, any risk
associated with these operations are far less than those of conventional aircraft. As set forth
in the Manual, the SUAS will be operated in a positively controlled area, where buildings
and people will not be exposed to operations without their authorized consent. No flight
will be taken without the permission of the property owner or manager and/or local
officials. Because of the advance notice to the property owner and participants, all affected
individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations as set forth in the Manual.
Furthermore, by operating at such lower altitudes, the SUAS will not interfere with other
aircraft that are subject to the minimum safe altitude regulations.

I. 14 CFR § 91.121 Altimeter Settings

This petition seeks an exemption from 14 CFR § 91.121, which requires a person
operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude or flight level by reference to an altimeter
that is set to the elevation of the departure airport or barometric pressure. An exemption is
required because the SUAS does not have a barometric altimeter, but rather a GPS altitude
read out.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by following the procedures set forth in the
PHANTOM, PHANTOM 2 VISION + and S-1000 SUAS' Manual. As prescribed in the
Manual, the operator will confirm the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude
indicator before flight. Moreover, the PIC will use the GPS altitude indicator to constantly
monitor the SUAS's height, thus ensuring operation at safe altitudes.

J. 14 CFR § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in V FR Conditions

This petition seeks an exemption from 14 CFR § 91.151(a)'s fuel requirements for flight in
VFR conditions. Section 91.151 states:

         (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the
         first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed:

                  (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or
                  (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

The battery supplying electric powering source for the SUAS provides approximately 20 to
30 minutes of powered flight. An exemption from the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14
CFR §91.151 is therefore required.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 25% of battery power,
whichever happens first. This restriction would be more than adequate to return the SUAS
to its planned landing zone from anywhere within its limited operating area. Operation of
the SUAS with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel does not engender the type of risks that
Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed of the small UAS.
Additionally, we are not planning or proposing to fly SUAS at night.

Operation of SUAS will be limited to predetermined and controlled areas where only
people and property owners, or official representatives who have signed waivers will be
allowed.

This request for exemption falls within the scope of prior exemptions. See e.g. Exemption
10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate without compliance with §
91.151 (a)); see also Exemptions 2689F, 5745, 10673, and 10808.

K. 14 CFR § 91.203 (a) & (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration

This petition seeks an exemption from civil aircraft certification and registration
requirements of 14 CFR § 91.203 (a) and (b). The regulation provides in pertinent part:

         (a) Except as provided in §91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it
         has within it the following:

                  (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate

         (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate
         required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued
         under §91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to
         the passengers or crew.

Petitioner is seeking an exemption from the airworthiness certificate requirements, an
exemption to this regulation is necessary because:

    1 No such certificate is available to be issued for airworthiness of a SUAS:
    2 SUAS load capacity and size does not allow it to carry certification and registration

         documents and it is impractical to display such documentation on the SUAS;
    3 SUAS does not have a cabin or cockpit entrance at which the documents could be

         displayed; and
    4 There are no passengers or crew for whom the certificates need be displayed.

Equivalent Level of Safety

To the extent these regulations are applicable to the proposed SUAS operations, an
equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground
control point or station where the pilot flying the SUAS will have immediate access to
them.

The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A representative sample of
other exceptions which includes Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A,
9816A, and 10700

L. 14 CFR §§ 91.405(a); 91.407(a) (1); 91.409(a) (2); 91.417 (a) & (b): Maintenance
Inspections

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the maintenance inspection requirements of 14
CFR §§ 91.405(a); 91.407(a) (1); 91.409(a) (2); 91.417 (a) & (b). These regulations specify
maintenance and inspection standards in reference to 14 CFR Part 43. See, e.g., 14 CFR §
91.405(a) (stating that each owner or operator of an aircraft "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections . . .
have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter"). An exemption of
these regulations is needed because Part 43 and these sections apply only to aircraft with an
airworthiness certificate, as such the SUAS does not have or is required to have at this
time.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved since maintenance and inspections will
be performed in accordance with the PHANTOM, PHANTOM 2 VISION + and S-1000
SUAS' Manuals. As provided in the Manual, the PIC will ensure that the SUAS is in
proper working order prior to initiating flight, perform routine or required maintenance,
and maintain a log of any maintenance performed. The PIC is the most familiar with the
craft and best suited to maintain the SUAS in an airworthy condition to provide the
equivalent level of safety.

If mechanical issues arise, the SUAS can land immediately no higher than 400 feet AGL at
the most. The SUAS' small size, carrying capacity, and the fact that flight operations will
only take place in restricted areas for periods of time not to exceed 25 minutes or until 25%
battery power remains, create less risk than the same factors associated with conventional
fixed-wing airplane and rotorcraft performing the same operation.

VIII PUBLIC INTEREST

Consistent with the requirements of 14 CFR §11.81(d), Petitioner offers the following
reasons why granting this petition for exemption is in the public interest, i.e., how granting
it would benefit the public as a whole.

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of small and lightweight SUAS'
in aerial services industry benefits the public as a whole in the following ways:

    · It helps fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section 333(a) through (c) of the Reform
         Act, namely, the FAA Administrator's assessment of whether certain UAS may
         operate safely in the National Airspace System before completion of the rulemaking
         required under Section 332 of the Reform Act.

    · The operation significantly improves safety and reduces risk by alleviating human
         exposure to danger associated with current aerial mission methods, namely, full size
         helicopters. Manned helicopters performing various low level inspections and

                                                 15 Revised 6/9/2015
               Above It All ­UAS Services, LLC - FAA 333 Exemption Request

         patrols have experienced an exceedingly high number of accidents and fatalities.
         The public's interest is furthered by reducing human exposure to death or serious
         injury associated with manned aircraft performing various low level inspections and
         patrols.
    · Petitioner's SUAS' are battery powered and create no emissions and are quite quiet.
         If Petitioner's SUAS crashes, there is no fuel to ignite and explode. Any impact of
         Petitioner's lightweight SUAS' is obviously, far less than a full size helicopter. The
         public's interest is furthered by minimizing human exposure to death or serious
         injury from an accident and ecological impact of by reducing to potentially harmful
         emissions and noise pollution associated with manned aircraft.
    · Problems with safety, cost, statistical integrity, and logistics continue to impede low
         level aerial missions conducted from conventional manned aircraft. The uses of
         SUAS' address these problems, thus proving to be a powerful tool for performing a
         wide-range of various low level aerial missions & applications with associated data
         processing functions to include inspection of; agriculture; building; travel & power
         utility infrastructure; professional surveying; real estate; law enforcement;
         Electronic News Gathering (ENG); television; movie filming; radiological &
         consequence management and scientific research & development are valuable and
         safe tools for these low level missions. The public as a whole will benefit from the
         safer and more cost-effective utility aerial services that SUAS operations provide.
    · There is also a financial benefit to the public. Current methods of capturing aerial
         imagery are expensive, which proves to be cost-prohibitive for many individuals
         and organizations. Granting exemptions such as the one proposed by Petitioner will
         make such services affordable to a wider group of prospective customers.

IX PRIVACY
All flights will occur over Petitioner's property or the Utility Customer's property with the
customer's prior consent and knowledge.

X FEDERAL REGISTAR SUMMARY

Pursuant to 14 CFR Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
FEDERAL REGISTER, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H;  14 CFR 91.121;
14 CFR Part 27;             14 CFR 91.151(a);
14 CFR 45.23(b);            14 CFR 91.203 (a) & (b);
14 CFR 91.7(a);             14 CFR 91.405(a);
14 CFR 91.9(b) (2);         14 CFR 91.407(a) (1);
14 CFR 91.103;              14 CFR 91.409(a) (2);
14 CFR 91.109(a);           14 CFR 91.417 (a) & (b)
14 CFR 91.119;

Approval of exemptions will allow commercial operations of small and lightweight
SUAS in the wide-range of various low level aerial missions & applications industry will
enhance safety by reducing risk. Conventional operations in this industry using manned
operations, rotorcraft or fixed-wing aircraft present the risks associated with vehicles that
weigh in the neighborhood of several thousand pounds and carrying large amounts of
fuel. Such aircraft must fly to and from the location and operate at low altitudes.

In contrast, a SUAS weighing fewer than 25 lbs. and powered by batteries eliminates
virtually all of that risk, given the reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on
board. The SUAS is transported, not flown, to the designated area and set up. The SUAS
carries no passengers or crew and, therefore, does not expose them to the risks associated
with manned aircraft flights.

The operation of small SUAS' weighting less than 25 lbs. provides an equivalent level of
safety and thus supports the grant of the exemptions requested herein, including
exempting the Petitioner from the requirements of Part 21 and allowing commercial
operations. These lightweight SUAS' operate at slow speeds, close to the ground, and in
a sterile environment. As a result, they are far safer than conventional aerial mission
operations conducted with fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters.

                 Biographical Background of the Above It All - UAS Team

Above It All - UAS Services, LLC (AIA-UAS) a small veteran & minority-owned
company incorporated in the State of Virginia. The company's mission is to provide
innovative myriad of aerial mission solutions that inspire and advance the efforts of its
clients and affiliates.

Mr. Dolan - Founder & Operations Officer, Charles Ciuzio ­ Chief Executive & Flight
Officer and Steve Curtis ­ Chief Technical Officer, have assembled a team of
experienced aviation, business and scientific professionals deeply rooted in aviation
industry committed to positively advancing the UAS industry on multiple platforms to
meet emerging market needs.

We have and continue to strive with our expertise in cutting edge aviation and science to
integrate UAS use across our country and the world in compliance with all government
laws and regulations, thus assuring the highest standards of safety and quality. The team
will be collaborating with the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership at Blacksburg, Virginia,
and the University of Las Vegas FAA UAS Test Sites to best meet these goals.

                                        Team Members Bios:

Tom Dolan ­ Founder & Operations, Mr. Dolan is a commercial instrument rated pilot
in helicopters, single and multi-engine airplanes with 2,000 hours of flight, a Safety
Officer for a local flying club and flying service. He was a pilot for a scheduled
helicopter airline around Manhattan New York after graduating from Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in 1982.

In 1988 he began his career as a Police Officer for the Nassau County Police Department
(NCPD) on Long Island, New York being assigned to the Marine-Aviation Bureau where
he either piloted Bell Jet Ranger helicopters or police boats on patrol missions, on, over
or around Nassau County its waterways, the gateway to the port of New York. During
police career he was assigned to rescue operations at Ground Zero on 9-11-2001 World
Trade Center Terrorist Attack, the downing of TWA's 747 Flight 800 disaster in March
1997, and the downing of the Avianca B-707 Flight 052 Disaster in January 1991. He
received the 5th Precincts "Top Cop Award" also the "Department of Transportations
9-11 Medal".

While still working as a Police Officer soon after the World Trade Center and Pentagon
Terrorist attacks, Mr. Dolan realized there was a large void in maritime security, so he
assembled a team to solve this dilemma, founding Homeland Security Aviation &
Maritime Services, Inc. (HSA), a technical support company dedicated to providing
expert system support solutions to measure radiation signatures to government customers
in the area of aerial & vessel-borne radiation detection systems and field operations.

HAS' team was compromised of members from the Pentagon, Nuclear Emergency
Search Team (NEST), Nuclear Physicists and a variety of scientist and technical experts,

that had a vast understanding of both the Federal and local levels of emergency response,
devised solutions to the response community of how best to detect and measure radiation
sources, along with on how to best shield and protect financial markets, utilities and
computer systems from effects of Electro Magnetic Pulse Weapons.

Mr. Dolan's HSA gained support and assistance for collaborative purposes from
Brookhaven National Laboratory, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, New York State
Foundation for Science & Technology (NYSTAR) and Homeland Security Chairman
Congressman ­ Peter King. The program was being picked up by the National Nuclear
Security Agency (NNSA) Administrator - Thomas Dagastino to perform a study with
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy (DoE) only to come
to an abrupt halt when new administration cut funding for all new NNSA projects.

With over 26 years with NCPD Mr. Dolan retired in 2012 and moved with his family to
central Virginia where he has worked closely with several law enforcement agencies on
the use of UAS's. Invited by Chief Sellers of Albemarle County Police Department
(ACPD), Tom demonstrated the usefulness of UAS' before citizen members of the
County's Crime Prevention Council. Sellers was instrumental in developing Virginia's
"Model Policy" on the use of UAS in law enforcement agencies for the Legislature,
Department of Criminal Justice Services & the Office of the Attorney General it the state
of Virginia. Those leery of the technology soon accepted the technology finding pros
outweighed the cons as long as the "Model" guidelines" were adhered to.

October 2nd 2013, Mr. Dolan successfully orchestrated the use of a high technology UAS
from Virginia Tech's Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP) in assisting in the close
to month long exhaustive search effort, led by Chief Sellers, for a missing University of
Virginia student, Hannah Graham. The use of this technology was welcomed by the
Charlottesville community which marked the first time in Virginia history that a UAS
was used by law enforcement, with the Federal Aviation Administrations approval.

Tom is a member of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association's Manned/Unmanned
Aircraft Integration Safety Committee, Safety Officer for both VDW Flight Services and
the Monticello Flying Club.

SAIC Exploranium in developing and producing radiation sensors for airborne
applications. One of his sensor systems at Exploranium was used by the military in a
Blackhawk helicopter searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.

Dr. Jens Hovgaard founded Radiation Solutions Inc. (RSI) in 1999. Upon inception,
RSI's primary function was to act as a consulting company to the nuclear industry. While
working with his customers and their supplied radiation detection systems, Dr. Hovgaard
identified there was a need for a new supplier of these systems that many on the market
did not actually deliver the state-of-the-art technology they promised. In 2006,
accompanied by a world-renowned nucleus of specialists, he began to design and
manufacture a "new generation" of radiation detection systems. The RSI team have a vast
amount of experience not only in the design of field-use radiation detection systems but
also in their applications. A vast majority of his sensors can be used on airborne
applications. He continues to decrease the detectors size and is collaborating with Mr.
Dolan to use UAS platforms to carry his detector/sensor payloads.

Dr. Hovgaard's focus is the design and manufacture of state-of-the art radiation detection
systems using advanced DSP (Digital Signal Processing) technology. This technology
provides a level of radiation detection previously only attainable in laboratory equipment.
He holds a Ph.D. from Technical University of Denmark specializing in airborne gamma
ray surveying.
