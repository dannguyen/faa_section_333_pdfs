                                                           Exemption No. 12040
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015-1248

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Counsel for Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc
Antonelli Law
35 East Wacker Drive
Suite 1875
Chicago, IL 60601

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc (hereinafter petitioner or operator)
for an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct utility and infrastructure inspections.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received three comments in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UASs proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1, a DraganflyerX4-ES, and a senseFly
eBee.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc is
granted an exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

perform aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations
listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc is hereafter
referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1,
         Draganflyer X4-ES, and senseFly eBee when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
                                                                                                            4

    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012
and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of 14 C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform

Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of Burns &
McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. ("Burns & McDonnell"), an operator of Small Unmanned
Aircraft Systems ("UAs") in order to conduct utility and infrastructure inspections. Specifically,
petitioner seeks an exemption from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed in

Appendices A and B to allow commercial operation of its UAs, so long as such operations are

conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA in

a grant of this petition. This request is substantially similar to other data collection petitions

previously approved, and should be considered under the expedited summary grant procedure.

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of (1) the DJI
Inspire 1, approved for commercial operations in Exemption Nos. 11279, 11280, 11288, 11295,
11303, 11313, 11314, and 11318; (2) the Draganflyer X4-ES, approved for commercial operations
in Exemption No. 11281; and (3) the senseFly eBee, approved for commercial operation in
Exemption Nos. 11170, 11194, 11227, 11257, 11263, 11266, 11273, and 11285; in Class G
airspace nationwide unless otherwise prescribed by an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued
COA. The UA operations contemplated by this petition are in the public interest because they
clearly satisfy the "Four D's" of exemplary uses of UAs: to replace work that is Dangerous,
Difficult, Dull, or Dirty, and at the same time provide an equivalent or greater level of safety than
alternative manned aircraft operations. The UAs covered by this petition are small battery-powered
craft, with the DJI Inspire 1 weighing approximately 6.5 lbs. (2.9 kg.), the Draganflyer X4-ES
weighing approximately 5 lbs. (3.2 kg.), and the senseFly eBee weighing approximately 1.52 lbs.
(0.69 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload. Operation of the UA under the strict conditions
proposed below will provide an equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended, while still
allowing commercial operations. Operations using these UAs are far safer than conventional
operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that weigh thousands of pounds,
carry highly flammable fuel, and operate in close proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure,
and people.

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. §11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.27; 14
C.F.R. 45.29; 14 C.F.R. 61.23(a) and (c); 14 C.F.R. 61.101(e)(4) and (5); 14 C.F.R.
61.113(a); 14 C.F.R. 61.315(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R.
91.9(c); 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.105; 14 C.F.R. 91.109; 14 C.F.R.
91.113(b); 14 C.F.R. 91.119 (c); 14 C.F.R. 91.121; 14 C.F.R. 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R.
91.203(a) and (b); 14 C.F.R. 215; 14 C.F.R. 91.403; 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a); 14 C.F.R.
91.407(a)(1); 14 C.F.R. 409(a)(1) and (2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to operate
commercially small unmanned aircraft systems (UAs) (6.5 lbs. or less).

    Approval of the exemption requested by petitioner will allow commercial operation of
    the DJI Inspire 1, the Draganflyer X4-ES, and the senseFly eBee for the purpose of
    utility and infrastructure inspections in Class G airspace nationwide, unless otherwise
    prescribed by an ATO-issued COA. The requested exemption should be granted
    because operation of small UAs, with the DJI Inspire 1 weighing approximately 6.5
    lbs. (2.9 kg.), the X4-ES weighing approximately 5 lbs. (3.2 kg.), and the senseFly eBee
    weighing approximately 1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload,
    conducted in the strict conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of
    safety, while still allowing commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by
    the exemption are far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters
    and fixed-wing aircraft weighing thousands of pounds and carrying highly flammable
    fuel, and operating in close proximity to the ground and people. The seven factors
    Congress directed the FAA to consider when approving Section 333 exemption
    petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports, proximity
    to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight ­ each support the request.
    In particular, the aircraft are small, and will operate at slow speeds, and close to the
    ground. The substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life, coupled
    with the low risk use of UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in favor of
    granting the exemption.

B. The Crew

         The crew will consist of a pilot in command (PIC) and a visual observer (VO). The PIC
and VO will have been trained in operation of UAs generally and received up-to-date information
on the UAs to be operated pursuant to this grant. The PIC will receive UA-specific training as
indicated in Exhibits 17, 27, and 35.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the training and
characteristics of the crew are numbers 3 and 6-9 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

C. Flight Conditions

         The UA will be used for utility and infrastructure inspections in Class G airspace (unless
otherwise prescribed by an ATO-issued COA) under 400 feet above ground level ("AGL") and
under controlled conditions over restricted property. Petitioner will work with the local FSDO
when planning operations. Petitioner will only operate its UA in visual meteorological conditions
(VMC). The UA will at all times be no less than 500 feet below and no less than 2,000 feet
horizontally from a cloud, and petitioner will not conduct operations unless visibility is at least 3
statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always make a safety assessment of the risk of
every operation, and will only operate when it is determined that no undue hazards are present.

         Please refer to the following sections of Exhibit 1 for more information about the flight
conditions:

         Section 4.0: Standard Operating Procedures
         Section 5.0: Type & Purpose of Operation
         Section 7.0: Emergency Contingency Plan

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the flight conditions in
which the UA will be operated are numbers 2, 4, 16, and 28-29 in Section V below. Each has been
adopted or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

D. Flight Operations

         The purpose of the UA flights for which exemption is requested will be to conduct utility
and infrastructure inspections.

         Every UA flight will use at minimum a two person flight crew: a PIC and a VO. The
standard operational procedures that they will follow are set out in the operating documents. Please
refer to the following exhibits for information pertaining to operations:

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 11-12, 17-25, and 32-35 in Section V below. Each has been accepted or imposed by the
FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

V. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at least
equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory structure.
Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to be bound
when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A contains a
matrix connecting (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for which it
provides an equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333 exemption grants
in which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety.

      Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national security
issue. Petitioner is willing to require its PICs to undergo a background check, including the
proposed Transportation Security Administration Vetting process, to ensure that no national
security threat is present. Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg.
9543 at 9572 (proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14 C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45, et al.).

             c. senseFly eBee: 1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.)

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of utility and infrastructure inspections in Class G airspace nationwide, unless otherwise
    prescribed by an ATO issued COA.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a PIC and VO.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in feet
    AGL.

5. The UA will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding:
             a. DJI Inspire 1: 43 knots;
             b. Draganflyer X4-ES: 26 knots; and
             c. senseFly eBee: 49 knots.

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the UA PIC and a VO.

                                                          9
7. The PIC will have completed UA-specific training prior to commercial operations.

8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification criteria
    and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with how the UA
    will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR
    §61.51(b). A record of the PIC training will be documented and made available upon request
    by the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during dedicated training
    sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential
    for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with
    appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance has
    been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance and
    alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in
    accordance with the UA manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements set forth in the operating documents.
    Maintenance, inspection, alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts will
    be noted in the aircraft records, including total time in service, description of work
    accomplished, and the signature of the authorized person returning the UA to service. The
    authorized person will make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken against
    discrepancies discovered between inspections.

15. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will not
    be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight operations.
                                                         10
16. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there
    is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and prepare to
    land with at least 25% battery power remaining.

17. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 25% battery
    reserve.

18. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

19. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will
    return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered
    in accordance with the operating documents

20. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

21. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow the
    procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating documents,
    it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request. If the
    petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA
    granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant of
    exemption.

22. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents of
    the landowners over which flights will be conducted.

23. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or city
    jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

24. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

25. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, altitude level
    and potential transponder requirements.

                                                         11
26. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM
    as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport management will
    be made available to the Administrator upon request.

27. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally from,
    a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

28. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

29. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

30. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

31. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

32. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

33. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating persons,
    vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

    a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the
         UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
         nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
         nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
         will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

    b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
         such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
         present an undue hazard.

    c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
         undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

34. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the National
    Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site:
    www.ntsb.gov.

VII. Privacy
         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all

flights will occur over private property. When a UA is being flown, the onboard cameras will be
focused on the ground beneath it, and thus turned so as to be facing away from any occupied
structures that may be in the area to minimize inadvertent video or still images of uninvolved
persons.

         All data collected will be for private use only and will not be distributed through public
channels. If such data is later made available for public view, all images containing uninvolved
persons will be blurred or blacked-out. No attempt will be made to identify any individuals filmed
during the flights except in cases where they are trespassing upon or damaging customer property,
or interfering with the petitioner's or its customers' operations.
VIII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety for utility and infrastructure inspections.
This type of data collection has previously been done by manned aircraft or by individuals on the
ground. Both are more time consuming and are more expensive than using a UA. Use of manned
aircraft poses enhanced risk to the pilot and onboard crew, who would be several hundred feet in
the air. Additionally, manned aircraft carry highly flammable fuel.

         The enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact achieved using a UA and carrying
no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying
crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UA operation
enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of petitioner's UA in the utility
and infrastructure inspection industries, pursuant to Burns & McDonnell's rules of operation.

Appendix B: Burns & McDonnell's argument for exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and
(c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a).

         Burns & McDonnell requests an exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4)
and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), so that the PIC of the UA will not be required to possess any pilot
license (sports, recreational, private or commercial). As the FAA and numerous other national
airspace regulators have recognized, UA operations conducted by persons who do not hold a pilot's
license can still achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned aircraft with
pilots holding any level of pilot's license.

         Although it recognizes that a pilot's license is unnecessary for safe UA operation, the FAA
has to date declined to allow grant exemptions under Section 333 that would permit individuals
who possess any pilot license (sports, recreational, private or commercial) to conduct commercial
UA operations. It has specified two reasons for declining to do so. First, it has stated that it does
not possess the authority under Section 333 to exempt individuals from the requirement under 49
U.S.C. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. Second, the FAA has concluded that
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) security screening required of all certified airmen
meets the statutory requirement in Section 333 that operations not pose a threat to national security.
Exemption No. 11110 at 15.

         Burns & McDonnell respectfully requests that the FAA reconsider its position. There is
no dispute that it is unnecessary for an operator of a UA to go through the rigorous process of
becoming a certified pilot in order to safely operate a UA. In addition, the FAA does have the
authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement in 49 U.S.C. §44711to hold an airman
certificate for "serv[ing] in the capacity for which the certificate was issued." Indeed, it has
exercised that authority repeatedly in the Section 333 process. Finally, the FAA's security concerns
can be addressed by a variety of methods involving operator background checks to be conducted
by government agencies.

             1. The FAA and foreign regulators recognize that obtaining a manned aircraft
                  pilot license is unnecessary for safe operation of a UA.

         The FAA, like the other national airspace regulators that have considered the issue, has
concluded that UA operations conducted by persons who do not hold a pilot's license can still
achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned aircraft with pilots holding
any level of pilot's license. In its recent UAS NPRM, the FAA stated:

         "While these airman certification requirements are necessary for manned aircraft
         operations, they impose an unnecessary burden for many small UAS operations.
         This is because a person typically obtains a private or commercial pilot certificate
         by learning how to operate a manned aircraft. Much of that knowledge would not
         be applicable to small UAS operations because a small UAS is operated differently
         than manned aircraft. In addition, the knowledge currently necessary to obtain a
         private or commercial pilot certificate would not equip the certificate holder with
         the tools necessary to safely operate a small UAS... Thus, requiring persons
         wishing to operate a small UAS to obtain a private or commercial pilot certificate
         imposes the cost of certification on those persons, but does not result in a significant
         safety benefit because the process of obtaining the certificate does not equip those

                                                         17
         persons with the tools necessary to mitigate the public risk posed by small UAS
         operations." Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg.
         9543 at 9550 (proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14 C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45,
         et al.).

         The FAA's conclusion that manned aircraft flying experience is unnecessary for the
operation of a UA is supported by research by the FAA and the Army Research Laboratory. They
demonstrate that UAs, even those much larger than the UAs proposed by Burns & McDonnell,
can be safely flown by non-certificated pilots with a small amount of training. For example, one
Army Research Laboratory study concluded:

         "[T]he specific motor skills needed to control the radio-controlled UAV would have
         to be learned by aviators independently of the motor skills learned in flying an
         aircraft. In particular, the somatic and visual cues that pilots use during aircraft
         landings would not be useful (and perhaps even counter-productive) for the
         different skill sets and perceptual viewpoint necessary for radio-controlled
         landings."1

         Additional research reports lend further support for the exclusion requested. For example,
a report sponsored by the FAA concluded that "We know that certain systems, like the U.S. Army
Hunter and Shadow systems, are successfully flown by pilots with no manned aircraft
experience."2

         In addition, foreign government airspace regulators that have examined the issue have
consistently recognized that the skills required to fly a manned aircraft are irrelevant to operating
a UA. For that reason, they have concluded that UA operators do not need to have a private or
commercial pilot's license. Canada, for example, does not require a pilot's license to operate a
UA. Transport Canada requires training of UA operators, but that training is limited to pilot ground
school and flight operation training on UAs, not manned aircraft.3 Moreover, Canada allows this
training to be "provided by other pilots, manufacturers, [UA] flight training organizations or . . .
self taught." 4 Petitioner has a number of potential PICs who have completed Transport Canada's

this concern, this concern is inapplicable as TourFactory's flights will not be in congested areas.

requirements for commercial UA operation yet have no manned aircraft certification. These
individuals ­ qualified to operate commercial UAs in Canada ­ should also be allowed to operate
commercial UAs in the United States. Please refer to Exhibit 7 for the training syllabus for the
ground school course these individuals took to qualify them to operate commercial UAs in Canada.

         Similarly, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recognized that
determining "Remote Pilot qualification requirements on the same basis as manned aircraft may
yield requirements that are too inflexible, too onerous and inappropriate for UAS operations."5 As
a result, the CAA only requires UA operators to demonstrate UA operator competence.6 While
there are a variety of ways to demonstrate competence, the most common is to complete a course
that will lead to a ground exam and flight test Australia, too, requires only passage of a UA-specific
ground school program in lieu of a manned airman certificate.7 Finally, more than a dozen
countries, including Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, have adopted the National
UAS Certificate for Small Unmanned Aircraft (BNUC-S) Standard for UA pilot certification.8
This standard results in a type-specific UA certificate and does not require the operator to have a
pilot's license. The process involves taking a short ground school course, passing a ground school
test and then passing a practical test on commercial operation of the specific UA per the UA
manufacturer's operations manual.

         All of this experience and evidence indicates that the proposed exemption will provide a
greater level of safety than operations under 14 C.F.R. §61.113. In this instance, the PICs will have
gone through training as described above in Section III B. This training and education is focused
on UAs generally, and in particular on the aircraft to be operated, rather than taking additional
time and risk to train on a manned aircraft, weighing several thousand pounds and carrying highly
flammable fuel.

         The FAA has concluded in the NPRM that such UA-specific training is more than
sufficient to provide an equivalent level of safety for UA operations. Sometime in the next 18-24
months, that position will be enshrined in a valid regulation. However, in the meantime, the FAA
claims it lacks the authority to relax the requirement to possess a pilot certificate. As we show in
the next section, that position is both incorrect and contradicted by the FAA's recent decisions.

         2. The FAA does have, and has already, exercised the authority to exempt petitioners
             from the airman certificate requirement.

         The FAA claims that it lacks authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement of 49
U.S. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman "to serve in the capacity for which
the certificate was issued." See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This claim is inconsistent with
both (i) the statutory language of that section and Section 333, and (ii) numerous recent FAA

decisions.

         The operative part of 49 USC §44711 provides that a "person may not . . . serve in any
capacity as an airman with respect to a civil aircraft, . . . used, or intended for use, in air commerce
-- (A) without an airman certificate authorizing the airman to serve in the capacity for which the
certificate was issued . . . " If the FAA's interpretation were correct, this language would require
that any person wishing to operate a UA for commercial operations have an airman certificate
authorizing the person to serve as an airman in commercial operations.

         However, in all of its recent grants of Section 333 petitions, the FAA has ­ without
explicitly acknowledging the fact - exempted commercial UA operators from the §44711(A)
requirement that they hold an airman certificate authorizing them "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." It has done so by allowing them to operate UA so long as they
hold a private pilot's or sport pilot's authorization, even though such a certificate does not permit
commercial operations. Exemption No. 11062 at 15-18; Exemption No. 11110 at 14-16;
Exemption No. 11191 at 3-5; and Exemption No. 11229 at 3 and 8.

         The FAA argues that it cannot exempt petitioners from the requirements of §44711
because, while the specific language of Section 333 grants it limited statutory flexibility relative
to 49 U.S.C. §44704 for the purposes of airworthiness certification, Section 333 does not provide
flexibility relative to §44711 and other sections of Title 49. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This
argument ignores the plain language of Section 333. The relevant language of Section 333 is:

         (a) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subtitle, and
         not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
         Transportation shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate
         safely in the national airspace system before completion of the plan and rulemaking
         required by section 332 of this Act or the guidance required by section 334 of this
         Act.

         (b) ASSESSMENT OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.--In making the
         determination under subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine, at a minimum--

         (1) which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size,
         weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and
         operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the national
         airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security; and

         (2) whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
         certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the
         operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1).

         (c) REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE OPERATION.--If the Secretary determines
         under this section that certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the
         national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe
         operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system.

         The language of Section 333(b) is permissive: it requires that the Secretary "determine, at
a minimum . . . whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness

                                                         20
certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the operation of
unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1)." Nothing in (b) precludes the Secretary
from determining whether or not a pilot's license is required for operation of a UA identified under
paragraph (b)(1).

         Indeed, the FAA has implicitly conceded the point by granting exemptions from the
requirement that commercial UA operators hold a commercial pilot certificate. From an analytical
standpoint, there is no difference between granting an exemption from the commercial pilot's
license requirement and granting an exemption from the private or sport pilot's license
requirement. Both are clearly exemptions from a specific statutory requirement in 49 U.S.C.
§44711. If the FAA has the statutory authority under Section 333(b) to do the former, it has the
same authority to do the latter.9

9 The FAA has not specifically identified the statutory provision that underpins its authority to
grant the exemptions from the commercial pilot's license requirement. Whether the statutory basis
is Section 333 or some other provision makes no difference. If there is a basis for a partial
exemption from in 49 U.S.C. § 44711, that basis also justifies an exemption from the entire
provision.

A. GENERAL: A model aircraft is a non-human-carrying aircraft capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere. It may not exceed limitations of this code and is
      intended exclusively for sport, recreation, education and/or competition. All model flights must be conducted in accordance with this safety code and any
      additional rules specific to the flying site.

  1. Model aircraft will not be flown:
         (a) In a careless or reckless manner.
         (b) At a location where model aircraft activities are prohibited.

  2. Model aircraft pilots will:
         (a) Yield the right of way to all human-carrying aircraft.
         (b) See and avoid all aircraft and a spotter must be used when appropriate. (AMA Document #540-D.)
         (c) Not fly higher than approximately 400 feet above ground level within three (3) miles of an airport without notifying the airport operator.
         (d) Not interfere with operations and traffic patterns at any airport, heliport or seaplane base except where there is a mixed use agreement.
         (e) Not exceed a takeoff weight, including fuel, of 55 pounds unless in compliance with the AMA Large Model Airplane program. (AMA Document 520-A.)
         (f) Ensure the aircraft is identified with the name and address or AMA number of the owner on the inside or affixed to the outside of the model aircraft. (This
              does not apply to model aircraft flown indoors.)
         (g) Not operate aircraft with metal-blade propellers or with gaseous boosts except for helicopters operated under the provisions of AMA Document #555.
         (h) Not operate model aircraft while under the influence of alcohol or while using any drug that could adversely affect the pilot's ability to safely control the
             model.
         (i) Not operate model aircraft carrying pyrotechnic devices that explode or burn, or any device which propels a projectile or drops any object that creates a
             hazard to persons or property.
             Exceptions:

              Free Flight fuses or devices that burn producing smoke and are securely attached to the model aircraft during flight.

              Rocket motors (using solid propellant) up to a G-series size may be used provided they remain attached to the model during flight. Model rockets may
                  be flown in accordance with the National Model Rocketry Safety Code but may not be launched from model aircraft.

              Officially designated AMA Air Show Teams (AST) are authorized to use devices and practices as defined within the Team AMA Program Document.
                  (AMA Document #718.)

         (j) Not operate a turbine-powered aircraft, unless in compliance with the AMA turbine regulations. (AMA Document #510-A.)

  3. Model aircraft will not be flown in AMA sanctioned events, air shows or model demonstrations unless:
         (a) The aircraft, control system and pilot skills have successfully demonstrated all maneuvers intended or anticipated prior to the specific event.
         (b) An inexperienced pilot is assisted by an experienced pilot.

  4. When and where required by rule, helmets must be properly worn and fastened. They must be OSHA, DOT, ANSI, SNELL or NOCSAE approved or comply
         with comparable standards.

B. RADIO CONTROL (RC)

  1. All pilots shall avoid flying directly over unprotected people, vessels, vehicles or structures and shall avoid endangerment of life and property of others.
  2. A successful radio equipment ground-range check in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations will be completed before the first flight of a new or

         repaired model aircraft.
  3. At all flying sites a safety line(s) must be established in front of which all flying takes place. (AMA Document #706.)

         (a) Only personnel associated with flying the model aircraft are allowed at or in front of the safety line.
         (b) At air shows or demonstrations, a straight safety line must be established.
         (c) An area away from the safety line must be maintained for spectators.
         (d) Intentional flying behind the safety line is prohibited.
  4. RC model aircraft must use the radio-control frequencies currently allowed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Only individuals properly
         licensed by the FCC are authorized to operate equipment on Amateur Band frequencies.
  5. RC model aircraft will not knowingly operate within three (3) miles of any pre-existing flying site without a frequency-management agreement. (AMA
         Documents #922 and #923.)
  6. With the exception of events flown under official AMA Competition Regulations, excluding takeoff and landing, no powered model may be flown outdoors
         closer than 25 feet to any individual, except for the pilot and the pilot's helper(s) located at the flightline.
  7. Under no circumstances may a pilot or other person touch an outdoor model aircraft in flight while it is still under power, except to divert it from striking an
         individual.
  8. RC night flying requires a lighting system providing the pilot with a clear view of the model's attitude and orientation at all times. Hand-held illumination
         systems are inadequate for night flying operations.
  9. The pilot of an RC model aircraft shall:
         (a) Maintain control during the entire flight, maintaining visual contact without enhancement other than by corrective lenses prescribed for the pilot.
         (b) Fly using the assistance of a camera or First-Person View (FPV) only in accordance with the procedures outlined in AMA Document #550.
         (c) Fly using the assistance of autopilot or stabilization system only in accordance with the procedures outlined in AMA Document #560.

C. FREE FLIGHT

  1. Must be at least 100 feet downwind of spectators and automobile parking when the model aircraft is launched.
  2. Launch area must be clear of all individuals except mechanics, officials, and other fliers.
  3. An effective device will be used to extinguish any fuse on the model aircraft after the fuse has completed its function.

               "SEE  AND  AVOID"  GUIDANCE  

 A.  General:  

  1. The  primary  means  to  avoid  collisions  between  all  aircraft  flying  within  our  National  Airspace  System
  (NAS)  is  "See  and  Avoid."  

  2. Vigilance  must  be  maintained  by  each  person  operating  an  aircraft  (whether  model  or  manned)  so  as  to
  "see  and  avoid"  other  aircraft.  

  3. Model  aircraft  must  avoid  manned  aircraft.  Our  privilege  to  fly  model  aircraft  in  the  NAS  depends  on  our
  commitment  to  remain  "well  clear"  of  manned  aircraft.  

  4. Simply  avoiding  an  actual  collision  is  not  enough.  A  "near  miss"  is  not  acceptable.

  5. Unless  flying  at  a  mixed-use  site  where  manned  and  model  aircraft  routinely  share  airspace  through
  their  own  site-specific  rules,  model  aircraft  must  fly  sufficiently  far  away  from  manned  aircraft  so  as  not  to  
  create  a  collision  hazard.  

  6. Model  aircraft  flying  must  not  only  be  safe,  it  must  be  perceived  to  be  safe  by  the  greater  manned
  aviation  community.  Modelers  must  continually  demonstrate  their  respect  for  the  safety  of  manned  
  aircraft  by  remaining  vigilant  and  well  clear.  

  7. Whenever  a  potential  conflict  arises  between  model  aircraft  and  manned  aircraft,  the  pilot  of  the  model
  aircraft  must  always  give  way  to  the  manned  aircraft.  

  8. The  pilot  of  a  model  aircraft  must  never  assume  the  pilot  of  a  manned  aircraft  can  see  the=  model  or  will
  perform  any  maneuver  to  avoid  the  model's  flight  path.  

  9. Visual  Line  of  Sight  is  required  by  the  Safety  Code.  It  means  that  visual  contact  with  the  aircraft  must  be
  maintained  without  enhancement  other  than  by  corrective  lenses  prescribed  for  the  model  aircraft  pilot.  
  All  RC  flying  must  remain  clear  of  clouds  smoke  or  any  other  obstruction  to  the  line  of  sight.  

  10. "Blue  Sky"  is  a  term  used  to  explain  the  method  used  to  increase  separation  between  a  model  and  a
  manned  aircraft  in  the  same  vicinity.  The  modeler  should  maneuver  the  aircraft  in  such  a  way  as  to  
  increase  the  amount  of  blue  sky  perceived  between  the  model  and  the  manned  aircraft.  By  increasing  the  
  blue  sky  separation,  the  question  about  depth  perception  is  taken  out  of  the  equation  and  the  modeler  
  need  not  worry  whether  the  model  is  closer  to  him  than  the  manned  aircraft  or  further  away.  Increasing  
  the  blue  sky  between  the  model  and  the  manned  aircraft  automatically  increases  separation  between  
  them.

  11. A  modeler  should  never  place  any  consideration  for  the  well-being  of  the  model  aircraft  above  the
  safety  of  manned  aircraft.  Maneuvering  to  avoid  the  conflict  may  require  that  the  model  aircraft  be  
  sacrificed.  
  12. Free  flight  models  should  not  be  launched  with  relatively  low  altitude  manned
  aircraft  in  sight  and  downwind  or  headed  downwind  from  the  launch  site.  

 B.  Spotters:  

  1. Before  a  flight,  the  pilot  must  insure  that  the  spotter  understands  his/her  duties
  and  expectations.  
  2. A  spotter  should  be  used  to  assist  in  monitoring  the  surrounding  airspace  for  manned  aircraft  whenever
  a  flight  is  expected  to  exceed  400  feet  above  the  ground  and  that  operation  is  expected  to  be  in  proximity  
  to  known  manned  aircraft  traffic  such  as  at  a  mixed-use  facility  or  within  three  miles  of  an  airport.  The  
  spotter  must  have  sufficient  visual  acuity  and  be  mature  enough  to  take  this  responsibility  very  seriously.  
  3. A  spotter  should  also  be  prepared  to  assist  his/her  pilot  in  the  event  that  another  model  aircraft  or
  spectators  become  endangered  or  in  turn  are  perceived  to  be  a  danger  to  the  pilot  or  the  pilot's  model  
  aircraft.  
  4. If  a  model  aircraft  pilot  experiences  what  he  or  she  considers  a  near  miss  with  a  manned  aircraft,  that
  model  aircraft  pilot  should  notify  AMA  Headquarters  with  a  written  report  of  the  incident,  including  action  
  taken  by  the  model  aircraft  pilot  to  avoid  the  manned  aircraft.  This  report  is  intended  to  help  the  modeler,  
  the  club,  and  the  AMA  capture  as  much  detail  as  possible  so  that  it  may  be  used  to  assist  all  parties  in  
  recalling  the  particulars  of  the  incident  at  a  later  time.  Call  1-800-435-9262  (1-800-IFLYAMA)  extension  230  
  or  251  for  assistance  with  this  report.

       Radio Controlled Model Aircraft Operation
Utilizing Failsafe, Stabilization and Autopilot Systems

1. DEFINITION OF TERMS:

         Please refer to Page 3, section 7 which contains an alphabetical listing of the definitions of the
         terms in italics that are used in this document.

2. GENERAL:

        All model aircraft flights utilizing stabilization and autopilot control systems must be conducted
        in accordance with AMA's current National Model Aircraft Safety Code and any additional rules
        specific to a flying site/location.

3. OPERATIONS ­ REQUIREMENTS ­ LIMITATIONS:

        a) AMA members flying radio controlled model aircraft equipped with flight stabilization and

             autopilot systems must maintain VLOS with the aircraft at all times including programmed
             autopilot waypoint flight.

        b) AMA Pilots must be able to instantaneously deactivate programmed flight of autopilot

             systems at any time during flight and resume manual control of the model aircraft.

        c) AMA Pilots must perform an R/C Test Flight of a model aircraft before activating a newly

             installed autopilot or stabilization system and/or after any repairs or replacement of model
             aircraft essential flight systems.

        d) Model aircraft exceeding 15lbs and/or 70mph may only use an autopilot for a programmed

             "return to launch" (RTL) flight and not for programmed waypoint flying of a predetermined
             course.

        e) STABILIZATION & AUTOPILOT SYSTEMS MAY BE USED FOR/TO:

         · Stabilization/automatically stabilize aircraft to level flight when control sticks are centered.
         · Recovery/activate TRX switch to recover an out of control aircraft to level flight.
         · Heading/activate TRX switch to hold a model aircraft's heading for precision flight path.
         · Altitude/activate TRX switch to maintain fixed aircraft altitude while allowing directional control.
         · Return GPS/activate TRX switch to return aircraft via GPS to launch point.
         · Return FSS/failsafe activated from radio signal loss to return aircraft via GPS to launch point.
         · Fixed circle/activate TRX switch to circle aircraft at point of activation at fixed altitude.
         · Waypoint/activate TRX switch to initiate an autopilot programmed flight path via waypoints.
         · Fencing/autopilot programed to display site unique boundaries on video monitor/goggles.

                                                         25
4. RANGE ­ ALTITUDE ­ WEIGHT ­ SPEED:

    a) One of the requirements in Federal Law (Public Law 112-95 Sec 336 (c) (2) February 14,
         2012) for model aircraft to be excluded from FAA regulations is that model aircraft be
         flown within VLOS of the operator.

    b) Model aircraft must be flown at or below 400 feet AGL when within 3 miles of an airport as
        stated in the AMA Safety Code.

    c) Model aircraft utilizing an autopilot for waypoint flying are limited to a maximum weight
         (including fuel, batteries, and onboard autopilot systems) of 15lbs and a speed of
         70mph.

5. RECOMMENDATIONS & INFORMATION:

    a) If your radio system lacks failsafe capability, consider using programmable digital servos or
         auxiliary failsafe modules. In the event of a radio signal failure these components will
         activate desired safe servo settings or an autopilot for return to base/launch (RTL).

    b) When using an autopilot system the "return to launch" (RTL) feature should be
         programmed to return the aircraft to a safe location and safely terminate the flight should
         manual control of the aircraft be lost. When using RTL, pay particular attention to the
         manufacturer's throttle recommendations to prevent stalling.

    c) The use of stabilization systems is recommended when flying FPV to improve flight
         stability and video quality.

    d) Pilots usually choose to incorporate stabilization and autopilot systems for model aircraft
         flying to enhance flight performance, correct bad tendencies of the model aircraft,
         maintain stability in windy weather, establish precision heading holds for
         takeoffs/landings, flight training for novice pilots, create a steady flight platform for
         cameras, and generally just to make an airplane easier and safer to fly.

    e) When purchasing stabilization and autopilot systems, always try to select quality equipment
         from reputable dealers, ensure for compatibility with other onboard systems, and install
         components according to manufacturers' instructions.

6. PRIVACY PROTECTION SAFEGUARDS:

         The use of imaging technology for aerial surveillance with radio control model aircraft
         having the capability of obtaining high-resolution photographs and/or video, or using any
         types of sensors, for the collection, retention, or dissemination of surveillance data or
         information on individuals, homes, businesses, or property at locations where there is
         a reasonable expectation of privacy is strictly prohibited by the AMA unless written
         expressed permission is obtained from the individual property owners or managers.

                                                                                                                        26
7. DEFINITIONS OF TERMS:

    AMA Pilot is an AMA member who is capable of manually operating an R/C transmitter to
    control a model aircraft's flight path within its safe intended flight envelope without losing
    control or having a collision.

    Autopilot Systems incorporate programmable flight stabilization with an altitude sensor and
    a GPS receiver for accurate positioning and to navigate/control a radio controlled model
    aircraft's flight path. Advanced systems offer software for entering navigable waypoints. The
    flight data waypoints may be saved to autopilot's/GPS memory for programmed flight.

     Essential Flight Systems are any systems or components necessary to maintain
     stable flight within a model aircraft's flight envelope. (This includes primary R/C systems
     and any stabilization or gyros required to maintain stability and heading in certain
     types of model aircraft that would be uncontrollable/unstable without their use).

    Failsafe Systems are designed to minimize or prevent damage and safely terminate a
    flight when a radio controlled model aircraft loses radio signal. Modern radio systems can
    be programmed to position servos to a desired control setting in the event of radio signal
    failure.

     First Person View (FPV) refers to the operation of a radio controlled (R/C) model aircraft
    using an onboard camera's cockpit view to orient and control the aircraft. (AMA Document
    #550).

     Flight Envelope is defined as the range of airspeeds, attitudes and flight maneuvers which
     a model aircraft can safely perform/operate for its intended use.

     Non-Essential Flight Systems are any systems or components that are not necessary to
     maintain stable flight within the model aircraft's intended flight envelope. (This includes
     autopilot or stabilization systems that can be activated and deactivated in flight by the pilot
     without affecting manually controlled stable flight).

     R/C Test Flight requires an AMA Pilot to manually operate an R/C transmitter to control
     a model aircraft's flight path and determine if the aircraft is capable of maintaining stable
     flight within its safe intended flight envelope.

     Stabilization Systems are designed to maintain intended model aircraft flight attitudes.
    The pilot can install, program and/or activate a system to stabilize yaw, pitch, or roll or any
    one attitude or combination of attitudes. Systems are often based on rate/heading hold
    gyros or inertial motion sensors utilizing multi-axis gyros and accelerometers for
     attitude stabilization.

    Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) is the distance at which the pilot is able to maintain visual
     contact with the aircraft and determine its orientation and attitude without enhancements
     other than corrective lenses.

                                                                                                                   27

    The following tutorials and manuals have been produced to help you make full use of your DJI Inspire 1:
    1. In The Box
    2. Disclaimer and Warning
    3. Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines
    4. INSPIRE 1 Safety Guidelines
    5. INSPIRE 1 Quick Start Guide
    6. INSPIRE 1 User Manual
    Check all of the included parts listed in the In The Box document. Read the Disclaimer and Warning,
    Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines, and INSPIRE 1 Safety Guidelines before flight. Then prepare for
    your first flight by using the INSPIRE 1 Quick Start Guide and watching all of the tutorial videos. If you have
    questions, refer to the INSPIRE 1 User Manual for more comprehensive information. Experienced users,
    particularly those who have previously used DJI products, may choose to skip to the Inspire 1 Quick Start
    Guide to begin preparing for flight.

    Individual Parts

    Remote Controller

    1. Linking is required if you wish to replace your remote controller or receiver, or add a new remote controller.
       Refer to the user manual for more information about how to link the aircraft.

    2. If the remote controller is powered on and has not been used for 5 minutes, it will sound an alert. After 10
       minutes it will automatically power off. Move the sticks or perform some other action to cancel the alert.

    3. A Slave remote controller cannot be linked with the aircraft and cannot control the aircraft's flight. You may
       change it to a Master remote controller via the DJI Pilot app, and then link it to the aircraft to control flight.

    4. Ensure the Mobile Device Holder is firmly in place and does not slip.
    5. For the GPS in the remote controller to function properly, and the Dynamic Home Point to be accurate,

       ensure the DJI logo is facing the sky and keep the remote controller away from any metal objects.
    6. Repair or replace the remote controller if damaged. A damaged remote controller antenna will greatly

       decrease performance.
    7. When on the go, you may charge the remote controller from the aircraft's Intelligent Flight Battery.

    Camera

    1. Photos or videos cannot be transmitted or copied from the camera if the Intelligent Flight Battery is powered off.
    2. Be sure to power off the Intelligent Flight Battery correctly, otherwise your camera parameters will not be saved

       and any recorded videos may be damaged.
    3. Test the camera by shooting a few test images to check that it is operating correctly before shooting important

       pictures.
    4. Respect the privacy of others when using the camera. Make sure you comply with local privacy laws, regulations

       and moral standards.
    5. Check camera settings before use to make sure you can adjust them to fit your needs.

    Gimbal

    1. The gimbal and gimbal connector are very delicate. Handle with care and do not touch the gimbal
       connector, as any damage will cause it to function abnormally.

    2. A gimbal motor error may occur if: (1) The aircraft is placed on uneven ground or other objects obstruct
       the gimbal's full range of motion, or (2) The gimbal has undergone an excessive impact, e.g. a collision.
       Please only takeoff from flat, open areas and protect the gimbal after powering up.

    3. Hold the gimbal firmly when detaching or reattaching it, so it does not drop.
    4. Do not add any payloads to the gimbal, as this may cause the gimbal to function abnormally, or even

    2 © 2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.  29
   lead to motor damage.
5. Precision elements in the gimbal may be damaged by a collision or impact, which will cause the gimbal

   to function abnormally.

Compass                                                                                                               EN

1. Ensure the compass is calibrated before every flight. Failure to calibrate may lead to a poor flight
   performance or even failure.

2. DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a chance of strong magnetic interference. This includes areas
   where there are massive metal objects, parking structures, steel reinforcements underground, or under bridges.

3. DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration, such as keys or mobile phones.
4. The compass should always be recalibrated when moving from indoor spaces to outdoor spaces.
5. If the rear LED shows a solid red light, compass calibration has failed. Please recalibrate.
6. After successful calibration, the compass may become abnormal when you put the aircraft on the

   ground. This is because of magnetic interference that may be underground. Move the aircraft to another
   location and try again.

Parameter Settings

The Inspire 1 features a built-in flight control system to make operation as safe as possible. However, it is
good practice to remove all propellers before switching it on for calibration or changing other parameter
settings.

Battery

Refer to the Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines and battery sticker for usage and maintenance information.

Storage and Transportation

1. Store the Intelligent Flight Battery and remote controller in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight,
   to ensure the built-in LiPo battery does not overheat. Recommended storage temperature: between
   22°C and 28°C for storage periods of more than three months. Never store in environments outside the
   temperature range of -20°C to 45°C.

2. Do not allow the camera to come into contact with, or become immersed in, water or other liquids. If it
   gets wet, wipe dry with a soft, absorbent cloth. Turning on an aircraft that has fallen into water may cause
   permanent component damage. Do not use substance containing alcohol, benzene, thinners or other
   flammable substances to clean or maintain the camera. Do not store the camera in humid or dusty areas.

3. Always keep all parts out of the reach of children, as the cables, straps or small parts may be dangerous
   if swallowed. If swallowed, go to the hospital immediately.

4. Detach the gimbal from the Inspire 1 when storing for a long period of time or transporting over long
   distances. Also replace the Gimbal Cover when storing.

Maintenance and Upkeep

1. Check every part of the aircraft if it is violently impacted. If you have any problems or questions, please
   contact a DJI authorized dealer.

2. Old, chipped, or broken propellers or motors should never be used.
3. Regularly check the Battery Level Indicators to see the current battery level and overall battery life. When

   the battery life reaches 0%, it can no longer be used.
4. After every 50 hours of flight time, DJI recommends you perform a thorough inspection of your Inspire 1

   and all of its parts and components to ensure the safe operation of your aircraft.

EN  Flight Environment Requirements

    1. Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speed exceeding 10m/s, snow,
       rain, smog, heavy wind, hail, lightning, tornado or hurricane.

    2. Do not use the aircraft in dust or sandstorms.
    3. Fly in open areas, as tall buildings or steel structures may affect the accuracy of the onboard compass

       and block the GPS signal.
    4. Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, people, animals, high voltage power lines, trees, and bodies of

       water when in flight.
    5. Avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment. Make sure to turn off the

       Wi-Fi on your mobile device.
    6. Do not fly near areas with magnetic or radio interference. These include but are not limited to: high

       voltage lines, large scale power transmission stations, mobile base stations and broadcasting towers.
       Failing to do so may compromise the transmission quality of this product, cause remote controller and
       video transmission errors may affect flight orientation and location accuracy. The aircraft may behave
       abnormally or fall out of control in areas with too much interference.
    7. P mode is unavailable in polar zones. Users can use ATTI mode instead.
    8. Do not fly the aircraft within no-fly zones specified by local laws and regulations.

    Flight Warnings

    Failsafe and Return to Home

    1. Return to Home will not work if the GPS signal is insufficient or GPS is not active.
    2. Press the RTH Button on the remote controller to bring the aircraft back to the Home Point instead of

       turning off the remote controller.
    3. Tall buildings may adversely affect the Failsafe function. Please adjust the aircraft location, altitude and

       speed while returning home to avoid obstacles.
    4. Make sure to always fly the aircraft within the transmission range of the remote controller.
    5. When updating the Home Point, do not block the GPS signal of the remote controller and ensure the new

       Home Point is correct on the live map.
    6. Do not update the Home Point near tall buildings, as the GPS may be blocked and lead to an incorrect

       the weather, the environment, or any nearby magnetic fields.

    Low Battery

    1. When the Critical Battery Level Warning activates and the aircraft is descending automatically, you may
       push the throttle upward to hover the aircraft and navigate it to a more appropriate location for landing.

    2. When battery warnings are triggered, please bring the aircraft back to the Home Point or land to avoid
       losing power during flight.

    Vision Positioning System

    1. The Vision Positioning System cannot work properly over surfaces that do not have pattern variations.
       The effective altitude for Vision Positioning System to function correctly is less than 2.5 meters.

    2. Vision Positioning System may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water.
    3. Vision Positioning System may not be able to recognize patterns on the ground in low light conditions (less

       than 100 lux).
    4. Keep your pets away from the aircraft when Vision Positioning System is activated, as the sonar sensors

       emit high frequency sound that is only audible to some pets.
    5. Note that Visual Positioning System may not function properly when the aircraft is flying too fast or too low.

            POWERFUL PROPULSION SYSTEM

The Inspire 1's propulsion system is unique among all flight platforms. We re-engineered and re-built the system to handle

                         TRANSFORMING DESIGN

Carbon fiber arms give you the strength to maneuver in the air and they transform, moving out of the camera's way at the flick of a switch. With a full 360
                              unobstructed view, you now have the freedom to capture shots independent of the direction you are flying.

   Every part, every component of the Inspire 1 was engineered to be durable and lightweight. The body's aerodynamic design cuts through the sky and
                               further enhances your control over the aircraft. This ensures long flight times and a long operational life.

   FLY INDOORS AND WITHOUT GPS
   USING VISION POSITIONING SYSTEM

       Indoor flight has always been a true test of skill for all levels of pilots. DJI's new
         Vision Positioning technology uses a specially designed camera as well as sonic
        waves to bring simplicity to flying indoors. This technology allows the Inspire to hold
         its position, stop when the controls are released, and respond to your commands
        even when GPS is unavailable.

INTELLIGENT POWER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A fully integrated intelligent battery powers your Inspire 1 and
virtually manages itself.

When in flight, your remaining battery power is shown live, letting
  you know how long you can continue to fly. Advanced
 algorithms calculate the distance of your aircraft and estimated
time to return home, letting you know when it's time to fly back.

The battery reports the voltage of each cell, the total lifetime
 charges and discharges, and the overall health and battery
status. All this helps you keep your Inspire 1 in the air and flying
for years to come.

                                                                                                 78
