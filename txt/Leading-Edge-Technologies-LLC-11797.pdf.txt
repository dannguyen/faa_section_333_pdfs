                                                           Exemption No. 11797
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1053

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Counsel for Leading Edge Technologies, LLC
Antonelli Law
100 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 7, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Leading Edge Technologies, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct precision agriculture.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a SenseFly eBee.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
                                                                                                                 2

consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Leading Edge Technologies, LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Leading Edge Technologies, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the SenseFly eBee
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act
of 2012 and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of 14
C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform

Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of Leading
Edge Technologies, LLC ("LET"), an operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft ("UA") used for

precision agriculture. Specifically, applicant seeks an exemption from the Federal Aviation
Regulations ("FARs") listed in Appendices A and B to allow commercial operation of its UA, so

long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may

be established by the FAA in a grant of this petition.

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the senseFly
eBee, for precision agriculture in Class G airspace nationwide, or as otherwise prescribed in an
Air Traffic Organization ("ATO") issued COA. The contemplated applications involve precision
aerial surveys of agricultural areas (including but not limited to farm fields), using a variety of
sensors and technologies (including but not limited to LIDAR, infrared photography,
photogrammetry and high-resolution imagery) to collect high quality, actionable data for use by
farmers, agronomists, crop consultants, and other agriculture industry professionals. The UA
operations contemplated by this petition are in the public interest because they clearly satisfy the
"Four D's" of exemplary uses of UAs: to replace work that is dangerous, difficult, dull, or dirty,
and at the same time provide an equivalent or greater level of safety than alternative manned
aircraft operations. The UA covered by this petition is a small battery-powered craft, weighing no
more than 1.8 lbs. (0.8 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload. Operation of the UA under the strict
conditions proposed below will provide an equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended, while
still allowing commercial operations. Operations using this UA are far safer than conventional
operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that weigh thousands of pounds,
carry highly flammable fuel, and operate in close proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure,
and people.

Congress directed the FAA to consider seven factors in deciding whether to approve
                                                 1

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

    Petitioner seeks an exemption from the following rules:

    14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.27; 14
    C.F.R. 45.29; 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c); 14 C.F.R.
    91.103(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.105; 14 C.F.R. 91.109; 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b); 14 C.F.R.
    91.119(c); 14 C.F.R. 91.121; 14 C.F.R. 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b); 14
    C.F.R. 215; 14 C.F.R. 91.403; 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.407(a)(1); 14 C.F.R.
    409(a)(1) and (a)(2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to operate commercially a small
    unmanned aircraft system (UA) (1.52lbs or less).

    Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the
    senseFly eBee for precision agriculture in Class G airspace nationwide, or as otherwise
    prescribed in an ATO issued COA. The requested exemption should be granted because
    operation of small UA, weighing approximately 1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.), inclusive of
    battery and payload, conducted in the strict conditions outlined below, will provide an
    equivalent level of safety, while still allowing commercial operations. The lightweight
    aircraft covered by the exemption are far safer than conventional operations conducted
    with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft weighing thousands of pounds and carrying
    highly flammable fuel, and operating in close proximity to the ground and people. The
    seven factors Congress directed the FAA to consider when approving Section 333
    exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports,
    proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight ­ each support
    the request. In particular, the aircraft are small, and will operate at slow speeds, and
    close to the ground in order to more safely and efficiently conduct operations that
    would otherwise be significantly more expensive or time consuming. The substantial
    increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life, coupled with the low risk use of
    UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in favor of granting the exemption.

III. Proposed Operations

A. The UA

         The requested exemption will permit petitioner to operate the eBee, with a maximum
weight of 1.52 lbs. (0.69 kg.), inclusive of batteries and technical payload. This rotorcraft operates
at a speed of no more than 49 knots and has the capability to hover and move in the vertical and
horizontal planes simultaneously.

         The UA will have the following specifications or equivalent:

Airframe: senseFly eBee
Wingspan: 96 cm. (3.2 ft.)
Control System: internal to the eBee which includes the Main Controller (MC), Internal
Measurement Unit (IMU) with a built-in internal sensor, barometric altimeter (which measures
attitude and altitude), compass, GPS, and radio receiver (Rx).
Transmitter (Tx): senseFly system with 2.4 GHz
Receiver (Rx): internal to eBee
Motor: electric brushless motor with nominal static thrust of 6.2 N
Data Link: 2.4 GHz USB ground modem
OSD: senseFly eMotion 2 software, which allows live telemetry to be displayed to the visual
observer, including the battery level and altitude
Batteries: Lithium Polymer batteries with capacity of 2150 mah

         Please refer to Exhibits 1-2 and 6-9 for further information about the airframe, control
system and transmitters. The petition and the supporting documentation in those exhibits and
Exhibits 3-5 are hereinafter referred to as the "operating documents."

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the characteristics of the
UA are numbers 1, 5, and 19 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or imposed by the FAA
in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions. In addition, the FAA has
previously approved flight of the eBee in Exemption No. 11170.

B. The Crew

         The crew will consist of a pilot in command (PIC) and a visual observer (VO). The PIC
will have, at minimum, a private pilot's license and a third class medical certificate.

         The PIC and VO will have been trained in operation of UA generally and received up-to-
date information on the UA to be operated pursuant to this grant. The PIC will have completed, at
a minimum, 16 hours of UA flight training with this specific UA prior to operations, and will be
required to participate in annual training thereafter.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the training and
characteristics of the crew are numbers 3 and 6-10 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

                                                          6
C. Flight Conditions

         The UA will be used for precision agriculture. It will be flown in Class G airspace
nationwide under 500 feet above ground level ("AGL"), unless otherwise prescribed by an ATO
issued COA, and under controlled conditions over rural agricultural property. Petitioner will work
with the local FSDO when planning operations. Petitioner will only operate its UA in visual
meteorological conditions (VMC). The UA will at all times be no less than 500 feet below and no
less than 2,000 feet horizontally from a cloud, and petitioner will not conduct operations unless
visibility is at least 3 statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always make a safety
assessment of the risk of every operation, and will only operate when it is determined that no
hazards are present.

         The 500 feet AGL limitation is in line with the Small UAS Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM). Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg. 9543 at 9547
(proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14 C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45, et al.)). The FAA determined
that this higher ceiling was a safe limit because:

         "most manned aircraft operations take place above 500 feet. Specifically, most
         manned aircraft operations conducted over uncongested areas must be flown at an
         altitude above 500 feet AGL, while most manned aircraft operations conducted
         over congested areas must be flown at an even higher altitude. Thus, a 500-foot
         altitude ceiling for small UAS operations would create a buffer between a small
         unmanned aircraft and most manned aircraft flying in the NAS... [T]here is
         significantly less air traffic at or below 500 feet than there is above 500 feet altitude.
         As a result of this difference in air-traffic density, the FAA has determined that
         small UAS operations would not pose a significant risk to manned aircraft
         operations taking place below 500 feet altitude if proper precautions are taken by
         the small UAS operator" Id. at 9562-63.

         Should the FAA not allow this request, petitioner will limit flights to 400 feet AGL.

         Please refer to Exhibit 5, Section 1.A for additional information regarding flight conditions.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the flight conditions in
which the UA will be operated are numbers 2, 4, 16, 25, and 27-29 in Section V below. Each has
been adopted or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption
petitions.

D. Flight Operations

         Every UA flight will use at minimum a two person flight crew: a PIC and a VO. The
standard operational procedures that they will follow are set out in the operating documents,
specifically Exhibits 1 and 5. Please refer to the following sections for information pertaining to
operations:

      Exhibit 1:
              Section 1.3: Creating a new flight plan
              Section 1.4: The mission phase of a flight
              Section 1.5: Simulating your flight

                                                          7

              Section 4: Flights
              Section 5: Inspections
              Section 6: Maintenance
              Section 7: Logbooks

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 2, 3-4, 11-18, 20-24, 26-27, and 31-36 in Section V below. Each has been accepted or
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

IV. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at least
equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory structure.
Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to be bound
when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A contains a
matrix connecting: (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for which it
provides an equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333 exemption grants
in which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety.

      Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national security
issue. The PIC will possess, at minimum, a private pilot's certificate and third class medical, so
he or she will have been subject to security screenings by the Department of Homeland Security.

V. Proposed Conditions of the Exemption

1. The UA will weigh no more than 1.8 lbs. (0.8 kg.), inclusive of battery and technical payload.

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of precision agriculture in Class G airspace nationwide.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and visual observer.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 500 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in feet
    AGL.

5. The UA will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 49 knots.

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the UA pilot in command (PIC) and a
    visual observer (VO).

7. The PIC will have, at minimum, a private pilot license and a third class medical certificate.

                                                          8
8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification criteria
    and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with how the UA
    will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR
    §61.51(b). A record of the PIC training will be documented and made available upon request
    by the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during dedicated training
    sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential
    for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with
    appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance has
    been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance and
    alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in
    accordance with the UA manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements set forth in the operating documents.
    Maintenance, inspection, alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts will
    be noted in the aircraft records, including total time in service, description of work
    accomplished, and the signature of the authorized person returning the UA to service. The
    authorized person will make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken against
    discrepancies discovered between inspections.

15. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will not
    be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight operations.

16. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there
                                                          9
    is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and prepare to
    land the UA with 25% battery power remaining.

17. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 25% battery
    reserve.

18. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

19. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will
    return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered
    in accordance with the operating documents

20. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

21. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow the
    procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating documents,
    it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request. If the
    petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA
    granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant of
    exemption.

22. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents of
    the landowners of the land over which flights will be conducted.

23. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or city
    jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

24. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

25. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, altitude level
    and potential transponder requirements.

26. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's

                                                         10
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM
    as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport management will
    be made available to the Administrator upon request.

27. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally from,
    a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

28. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

29. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

30. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

31. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

32. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

33. The UA will not be operated over congested or densely populated areas.

34. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating persons,
    vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

    a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the
         UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
         nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
         nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
         will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

    b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
         such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
         present an undue hazard.

    c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
         undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

35. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's UA
    Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the National
    Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site:
    www.ntsb.gov.

                                                         11
VI. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur over rural, private property that petitioner has been contracted to fly over. When
the UA is being flown, the onboard cameras will be focused on ground area, not on
nonparticipating individuals who may be present during operations. Once the data has been
collected, the file will be trimmed so that it only contains images of the field being monitored. The
data will be distributed only to the client.

VII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety in the precision agriculture industry. The
enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact achieved using a UA with the specifications
described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good
cause to find that the UA operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of applicant's UA for precision
agriculture operations, pursuant to petitioner's rules of operation.

         Use of UA technology to assist in precision agriculture is a benefit not only to farmers, but
to the public as a whole, and to the environment. Farmers will have greater crop analytical tools at
their disposal for managing crops, leading to decreased use of resources. This will result in both
reduction of cost and increase in quality ­ benefits that will be passed on to the public.
Additionally, using less water and chemicals during commercial farming operations will reduce
the impact that the operation has on the environment.

         As Jeff Vanderwerff testified on behalf of the American Farm Bureau Federation before
members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation on March 24, 2015:

         [The benefit of UA comes from] their ability to provide detailed scouting
         information on weed emergence, insect infestations and potential nutrient
         shortages. This valuable information allows the farmer to catch these threats before
         they develop into significant and catastrophic problems. By addressing threats
         quickly, the farmer has a greater likelihood of being able to respond appropriately
         so as to optimize yields.

         The imagery from UAS also allows the farmer to spot-treat sections of the fields as
         opposed to watering or spraying the entire field. The quicker a farmer can discover
         a potential threat, the quicker the farmer can address the issue. Images from UAS
         allow the farmer to identify the specific location where a specific treatment ­ be it
         fertilizer, water, pesticides, or herbicides is necessary; in doing so, the farmer can
         eliminate the need to use these applications more broadly across the entire field. By
         spot-treating threats to the crop, the farmer not only lowers the cost of treatment
         but also has the potential of lowering the environmental impact by minimizing

                                                         12
         application." (emphasis added)1
         The FAA has previously determined that the use of the eBee for precision agriculture will
provide an equivalent or greater level of safety than manned flight in Exemption No. 11170.
         Additionally, the FAA has previously approved a variety of other UAs for commercial
precision farming and agriculture applications in Exemption Nos.:
         11110 (precision aerial surveys);
         11136 (photogrammetry and crop scouting in order to perform precision agriculture);
         11166 (agriculture analysis and high resolution aerial imagery);
         11167 (high-resolution aerial imagery in support of, biomass analysis and estimation, yield
         monitoring, leaf area indexing and reporting of geographical data and overall crop health
         to a domestic agricultural seed company);
         11177 (commercial precision agriculture surveys);
         11192 (aerial photography and 3D mapping for the agriculture industry);
         11193 (precision photogrammetry and crop scouting for precision agriculture);
         11195 (aerial photography for agriculture);
         11222 (collect high quality, actionable data for use by agronomists, crop consultants, and
         forestry professionals);
         11223 (precision agriculture survey and inspection operations);
         11226 (precision aerial surveys);
         11228 (aerial acquisition and research in support of the agriculture industry); and
         11229 ((aerial acquisition and research in support of the agriculture industry).
