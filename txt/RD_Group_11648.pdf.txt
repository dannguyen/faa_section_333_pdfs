                                                           Exemption No. 11648
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0696

Mr. David W. Mansen
RD Group
10736 Vista Heights Boulevard
Fort Worth, TX 76108

Dear Mr. Mansen:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 13, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of RD Group (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The exemption
would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
video and photography services for real estate and construction, surveying and inspection,
marine and wildlife, agriculture and for special events.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, RD Group is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, RD Group is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day

Re: Exemption request pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of
2012

In accordance with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA), Section 333 Special
Rules for Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems, RD Group seeks an exemption from FAA
regulations restricting COMMERCIAL operation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS).

RD Group specifically requests relief from the listed FAA Regulations to permit COMMERCIAL
operation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) under the conditions outlined herein or as
may be established by the FAA.

RD Group also request relief from such other FARS as the FAA deems appropriate to enable RD
Group's requested operations.

The FAA make any modifications it determines necessary in the granting of this Section 333
Exemption request.

FAA has permission to utilize any or all RD Group proprietary documents as necessary to
facilitate approval of this requested exemption.

RD Group seeks relief to permit commercial operations utilizing sUAS to conduct aerial video
and photography services for real estate and construction, surveying and inspection, marine and
wildlife, agriculture and for special events.

We will gladly discuss any changes, modifications or amendments to our manuals, procedures or
practices to satisfy FAA requirements for approval of this exemption.

Thank you,

David w Mansen                                                                   Document No.: DP1001

      Section 333 Exemption Request - RD Group

                  Overview

3 ) Ov e rv ie w

In accordance with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA), Section 333 Special
Rules for Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems, RD Group seeks an exemption from FAA
regulations restricting COMMERCIAL operation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS).

RD Group specifically requests relief from the listed FAA Regulations to permit COMMERCIAL
operation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) under the conditions outlined herein or as
may be established by the FAA.

RD Group also request relief from such other FARS as the FAA deems appropriate to enable RD
Group's requested operations.

The FAA make any modifications it determines necessary in the granting of this Section 333
Exemption request.

FAA has permission to utilize any or all RD Group proprietary documents as necessary to
facilitate approval of this requested exemption.

Existing FAA Regulations burden RD Group's sUAS operations by preventing RD Group from
performing commercial sUAS operations to conduct aerial video and photography services.

RD Group seeks relief to permit commercial operations utilizing sUAS to conduct aerial video
and photography services for real estate and construction, surveying and inspection, marine and
wildlife, agriculture and for special events.

All RD Group sUAS flights will operate in a tightly controlled area, below 400 feet AGL, and over
private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner.

RD Group seeks relief from these FAA Regulations because:

     1) Existing FAA Regulations provide and undue burden upon RD Group's commercial sUAS
            operations.

            a) RD Group operations are described in detail in section 5 (RD Group)

     2) Equivalent Level of Safety

            a) Operation of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) by RD Group with the sUAS
                  Aircraft, sUAS Flight Crew, sUAS Operating Parameters, sUAS Maintenance and
                  sUAS training requirements as outlined in this request for a Section 333 exemption
                  provide an equivalent level of safety

     3) Public interest

            a) Granting these requested exemptions is in the public interest.

            b) For the public interest is described in detail in section 11 (For the Good of the
                  Public)

The FAA's authority to issue exemptions from current operating rules and regulations, and the
Secretary's authority granted by section 333 of P.L. 112-95 (Special Rules for Certain
Unmanned Aircraft Systems) provides an opportunity to authorize certain sUAS operations into
the National Airspace System (NAS) prior to implementation of the final sUAS rule.

Granting of this exemption request will permit RD Group to safely and legally utilize sUAS in the

NAS.

Section 333 Exemption Request - RD Group

                                     Overview

                                     ***

Enclosed are the following documents to support RD Group's Section 333 Exemption request:

1) DJI Phantom User's Manual
2) DJI Phantom Pilot Training Guide

                                     ***

Safety is achieved through the relentless pursuit of quality training and adherence to FAA
Approved Operating Procedures and FAA Regulations.

RD Group adheres to the Academy of Model Aeronautics National Model Aircraft (AMA) Safety
Code. A copy of this code is included with this Section 333 Exemption request. All RD Group
Flight Operators (Pilots) and Visual Observers (VO) are trained on the standards of this safety
code.

Our approach to the safe operation of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) is three fold:
Operational Procedures (Adherence to FAA Regulations) - Training ­ Intelligent Aircraft.

                                                                    ***

RD Group operates small, lightweight rotorcraft (multi-rotor / quad-rotor) sUAS weighing less
than 6 Lbs. (gross weight including payload). These intelligent GPS enabled sUAS have the
ability to "auto hoover" and "auto return home" in the event of a loss of RF control signal.

sUAS aircraft operated by RD Group are discussed in detail in Section 6 (sUAS Aircraft).

                                                                    ***

Flight crew for RD Group sUAS operations will be a Flight Operator (Pilot) and a Visual Observer
(VO).

The Flight Operator (Pilot) will possess a current FAA private pilot license and a current FAA
Class III medical certificate. The Visual Observer (VO) will have received required RD Group
training to qualify for Visual Observer (VO) duties.

RD Group Flight Crew requirements are discussed in detail in Section 7 (sUAS Pilot in
Command).

                                                                    ***

RD Group flight operations are conducted over private or over controlled access property, below
400 feet AGL and with the permission of the property owner/controller or authorized
representative.

During RD Group flight operations the sUAS will always be within visual line of sight (VLOS) of
either the Flight Operator (Pilot) or the Visual Observer (VO).

sUAS flight operations will always be operated in areas that are clear of people, except for
personal directly involved with sUAS operations.

RD Group flight operations are discussed in detail in Section 8 (sUAS Operating Parameters).

4 ) Re g ulatio ns Re lie f S o ug ht Fo r

Listed below are FAA regulations for which RD Group is seeking relief.

RD Group also request relief from such other FARS as the FAA deems appropriate to enable RD
Group's requested operations.

The FAA make any modifications it determines necessary in the granting of this Section 333
Exemption request.

14 CFR § 61.23 (a)(2)

           §61.23 Medical certificates: Requirement and duration.

                      (a) Operations requiring a medical certificate. Except as provided in paragraphs
                      (b) and (c) of this section, a person--

                                 (2) Must hold at least a second class medical certificate when exercising:

                                            (i) Second-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot
                                            certificate in part 121 of this chapter (other than operations
                                            specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section); or

                                            (ii) Privileges of a commercial pilot certificate; or

                                 (3) Must hold at least a third-class medical certificate--

                                            (i) When exercising the privileges of a private pilot certificate;

Relief from 14 CFR § 61.23 (a)(2) is sought from the requirement to hold a Second Class Medical
Certificate for commercial flight operations. For sUAS operations a Third Class Medical
Certificate (as required for Private Pilot Privileges) provides an equivalent level of safety as that
of a Second Class Medical Certificate given that:

           1) No persons (crew/passengers) or cargo are carried onboard the sUAS.
           2) The sUAS has the ability to "auto hoover" and "auto return home" at the touch of

                      a button.
           3) In the event of incapacitation of the Flight Operator (Pilot) the sUAS will

                      automatically begin a descent and landing when the battery level is reduced to
                      below 15%.

                                    Regulations Relief Sought For

14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b)

           §61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.

                      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, no person
                      who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft
                      that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire; nor may that
                      person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft.

                      (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an
                      aircraft in connection with any business or employment if:

                                 (1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and

                                 (2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation
                                 or hire.

Relief from 14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b) is sought from the requirement for the sUAS Flight
Operator (Pilot) to hold a FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate.

RD Group Flight Operator (Pilot) will hold a FAA Private Pilot Certificate.

A pilot with a FAA Private Pilot Certificate and a pilot with a FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate
have both demonstrated a parallel level of required aeronautical knowledge. A FAA Commercial
Pilot Certificate requires demonstration of further airmanship skills to safely carry passengers
and cargo for hire. RD Group sUAS will not carry onboard any persons (passengers/crew) or
cargo for hire.

For sUAS operations a pilot with a FAA Private Pilot Certificate will provide the equivalent and
required level of safety to operate the sUAS as would a pilot with a FAA Commercial Pilot
Certificate.

These enhanced airmanship skills are not utilized in flight of the sUAS, thus a Flight Operator
(Pilot) holding a FAA Private Pilot Certificate with sUAS flight training will provide an equivalent
level of safety.

In the granting of exemption #11062 to Astraeus Aerial the FAA determined that a PIC with a
FAA Private Pilot Certificate operating the sUAS would not adversely affect operations in the
NAS or present a hazard to persons or property on the ground.

In similar fashion to Astraeus Aerial operations, RD Group operations are conducted over private
property or over controlled access property and with the permission of the property
owner/controller or authorized representative.

The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b)] in
exemption #11062 to Astraeus Aerial.

             This Section 333                         Document No.: DP1001
        Exemption request may                      Initial Release: 29 Sep 2014

14 CFR § 91.7 (a)

           §91.7 Civil aircraft airworthiness.

                      (a) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition.

Relief from 14 CFR § 91.7 (a) is sought requiring Civil Aircraft Airworthiness because:

           1) The sUAS will not receive and Airworthiness Certificate under 14 CFR § 21.
           2) Compliance with RD Group Operating Documents will provide a means of insuring

                      an equivalent level of safety.
           3) The Flight Operator (Pilot) of the sUAS has final authority to determine whether

                      the sUAS in a safe condition for flight.
In the granting of exemption #11188 to State Farm the FAA determined that even though the
sUAS is not required to have an airworthiness certificate per 14 CFR § 21 Subpart H, relief from
the requirements of 14 CFR § 91.7 (a) [Civil Aircraft Airworthiness] is required.

The FAA considers compliance with operating documents to be a sufficient means of determining
an airworthy condition in accordance with the requirements of this part.

Additionally, in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.7 (b), the PIC is responsible for determining
whether the aircraft is in a condition for safe flight. The FAA found in the granting of exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company that the PIC can comply with this
requirement.

The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 91.7 (a)] in exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

14 CFR § 91.119 (c)

           §91.119 Minimum safe altitudes: General.

           Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below
           the following altitudes:

                       (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface,
                      except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft
                      may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or
                      structure.

Relief from 14 CFR § 91.119 (c) is sought because:

           1) All sUAS flights are conducted below 500 feet AGL.
           2) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over

                      private or controlled property with permission of the property owner.
In the granting of exemption #11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company the
FAA determined that sUAS operations should remain 500 feet from all persons not directly
involved with sUAS operations. The FAA also has determined that operations of closer than 500
feet may be permitted if:

           1) All non-participating persons are protected by a suitable shelter.
           2) Permission has been granted by the property owner/controller or authorized

                      representative.

                      (b) The lowest usable flight level is determined by the atmospheric pressure in
                      the area of operation as shown in the following table:

                      (c) To convert minimum altitude prescribed under §§91.119 and 91.177 to the
                      minimum flight level, the pilot shall take the flight level equivalent of the minimum
                      altitude in feet and add the appropriate number of feet specified below, according
                      to the current reported altimeter setting:

Relief from 14 CFR § 121 is sought because:

           1) The sUAS is not equipped with an altimeter.
           2) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over

                      private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner.
           3) All sUAS flights are conducted below 400 feet AGL.

                      a. GPS altitude information from the sUAS will be via a data down-link and will
                           be displayed to the Flight Operator (Pilot) in real-time..

           4) This provides an equivalent level of safety.
In the granting of exemption #11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company the
FAA determined that:

           1) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over
                      private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner and
                      within VLOS of the Flight Operator (Pilot) or Visual Observer (VO).

           2) The use of onboard GPS altitude information is provided via a data down-link and
                      to the PIC

14 CFR § 91.151 (a) and (b)

           §91.151 Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.

                      (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
                      (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
                      the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed--

                                 (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or

                                 (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

                      (b) No person may begin a flight in a rotorcraft under VFR conditions unless
                      (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
                      the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly
                      after that for at least 20 minutes.

Relief from 14 CFR § 91.151 (a) and (b) is sought because:

           1) Complying with the 30 minute fuel reserve would unnecessarily limit the length of
                      the sUAS flights. The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ has a endurance limit of 25 minutes.

           2) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over
                      private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner.

           3) The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ sUAS has the enhanced safety feature that it will
                      automatically descend and land when the battery level falls to below 15%. Upon
                      landing the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ motors will stop.

           4) The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ sUAS provides the Flight Operator (Pilot) real-time
                      display of available remaining battery power for flight.

           5) An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 25% available
                      battery power.

           6) The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ sUAS operated by RD Group is a rotorcraft (multi-
                      rotor / quad-rotor) unmanned aircraft.

5 ) RD Gro up

RD Group is an American owned and operated company that performs commercial aerial video
and photography services for real estate and construction, surveying and inspection, marine and
wildlife, agriculture and for special events.

In the United States we utilize Certified manned aircraft and Certified manned helicopters with a
pilot who holds a FAA Pilot Commercial Certificate.

In numerous International Countries we are permitted by law to utilize small Unmanned Aircraft
System (sUAS) to perform these same commercial aerial video and photography services. The
use of sUAS provides an increase in operational flexibility and provides higher quality images at
a greatly reduced economic cost.

However in the United States (our country of residency and citizenship) we are permitted to fly
a sUAS for hobby or recreational purposes only (commercial operation is prohibited)!

Existing FAA Regulations burden RD Group's sUAS operations by preventing RD Group from
performing commercial sUAS operations to conduct aerial video and photography services for
real estate and construction, surveying and inspection, marine and wildlife, agriculture and for
special events

RD Group is owned and operated by Mr. David w Mansen.

With over thirty years' experience in the airspace industry interacting with the FAA as a Pilot,
as a FAA Part 145 Maintenance Inspector and as a FAA Part 145 Repair Station "FAA
Accountable Manager" Mr. Mansen has demonstrated an exemplary record of safe operation and
of adherence to FAA regulations.

Mr. Mansen currently holds a FAA Private Pilot License with ASEL (airplane single engine land)
and AMEL (airplane multi engine land) ratings. Since the issuance of this license in the early
1980's, Mr. Mansen has had ZERO FAA safety incidents, ZERO FAA infractions, and ZERO FAA
citations ­ an impeccable and spotless record of adherence to safety and adherence to FAA
regulations.

Mr. Mansen founded TexasGYRO (T69R487X), a FAA Part 145 Licensed Aircraft Maintenance
facility and through smart business practices, a relentless pursuit of safety and adherence to
FAA regulations was able to sell TexasGYRO as a successful business after ten years of
operation.

Mr. Mansen served as the FAA Accountable Manager at TexasGYRO for ten years with ZERO
FAA safety incidents, ZERO FAA infractions, and ZERO FAA citations. Mr. Mansen has proven
that he has the skill, knowledge and experience necessary to install a successful training
program and to manage and operate a FAA Certified Aerospace facility.

Mr. Mansen has an impeccable record of safety and adhering to FAA regulations.

6 ) s UAS Airc raft

Hobbyist and aircraft enthusiast have been safely flying remotely controlled aircraft for decades.
In June of 1981 the FAA publish AC 91-57 (Model Aircraft Operating Standards). This set the
standard for operation by which we have safely abided by for over thirty years.

Accepted safe practices for hobby and recreation flying of a remotely controlled aircraft are that
a vehicle must weigh less than 55 lbs., must be operated within line-of-sight of the operator and
must not exceed an operating altitude of 400 feet AGL (above ground level).

Technology advances ­ Time passes. With today's technology we have the capability to mount a
lightweight still or video camera in a remotely controlled aircraft and monitor this video feed in
real-time during flight. This ability to capture video and still images is the foundation for
commercial sUAS operation today.

                                                                    ***

With the technology available today the safety of a sUAS has been increased dramatically. On
today's sUAS there is an intelligent Flight Control System coupled with built-in GPS providing
accurate GPS position information.

Telemetry provides real-time data to the Flight Operator (Pilot) with altitude (AGL), flight speed
and distance from the Flight Operator (Pilot). The Flight Operator (Pilot) is also provided in real-
time the available remaining battery power for flight and the number of GPS satellites in view. A
"radar style display" provides real-time location and heading relative to the Flight Operator
(Pilot).

The Flight Operator (Pilot) is no longer estimating his/her altitude, speed, distance and heading
or available flight power. He/she views these critical flight parameters live and in real-time.

The intelligent Flight Control System onboard the sUAS is programmed via software to limit the
flight altitude to 400 feet AGL. There will be no inadvertent flight above the restricted operating
altitude.

The intelligent Flight Control System onboard the sUAS is programmed via software to prevent
motor start within 5 nautical miles of an airport or in restricted or in prohibited airspace. This
prevents inadvertent flight within 5 nautical miles of an airport or otherwise restricted airspace.

The intelligent Flight Control System coupled with GPS position information provides the ability
for the Flight Operator (Pilot) to permit the sUAS to auto-hoover in position with compensation
for wind drift.

The intelligent Flight Control System coupled with GPS position information provides the ability
for the Flight Operator (Pilot) to command the sUAS to automatically return to its point of
departure.

The sUAS will return to its point of departure automatically in the event of a loss of RF Control
from the Flight Operator (Pilot).

                                                                    ***

Private Pilot Certificate

A pilot with a FAA Private Pilot Certificate and a pilot with a FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate
have both demonstrated a parallel level of knowledge in required aeronautical knowledge. A FAA
Commercial Pilot Certificate will demonstrate further airmanship skills to safely carry
passengers and cargo for hire. A sUAS will not carry passengers or cargo for hire. Thus a Flight
Operator (Pilot) with a FAA Private Pilot Certificate will provide the equivalent and required
level of safety to operate a sUAS as a Flight Operator (Pilot) with a FAA Commercial Pilot
Certificate.

These enhanced airmanship skills are not utilized in the flight of the sUAS thus a FAA
Certificated Private Pilot with sUAS flight training will provide an equivalent level of safety.

In the granting of exemption #11062 to Astraeus Aerial the FAA determined that a PIC with a
FAA Private Pilot Certificate operating the sUAS would not adversely affect operations in the
NAS or present a hazard to persons or property on the ground.

In similar fashion to Astraeus Aerial operations, RD Group operations are conducted over private
property or over controlled access property and with the permission of the property
owner/controller or authorized representative.

RD Group sUAS Flight Operator (Pilot) holds a current FAA Private Pilot Certificate.

Third Class Medical Certificate

A Third Class Medical Certificate provides an equivalent level of safety as a FAA Second Class
Medical Certificate given the level of safety required for sUAS flight operations.

A Third Class Medical Certificate provides an equivalent level of safety as does a FAA Second
Class Medical Certificate given:

     1) There are no persons (crew or passengers) or cargo onboard the sUAS.
     2) The sUAS ability to "auto hoover" and "auto return home" at the touch of a button.
     3) In event of incapacitation of the Flight Operator (Pilot) the sUAS will automatically begin

Equivalent Level of Safety

small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) operated by RD Group provide an increased level of
safety vs. certified manned aircraft because of their small size, slow airspeed, light weight,
operator license requirements, intelligent sUAS systems and operational parameters required.

A low flying aircraft or a low altitude helicopter (operating in strict compliance with existing FAA
regulations) hovering and circling over a small confined area creates an inherent safety risk.
This risk can be minimized, but cannot be eliminated. Manned flight involves hazards to life and
property.

In the event of an accident or incident the damage caused by a small lightweight sUAS is
considerably less than the damage caused by much larger and heavier manned aircraft. The risk
of injury or death to people or persons is significantly lower with the use of a sUAS because of
the small size, lightweight and slow airspeed of the sUAS.

Certified and manned aircraft are significantly larger and more complex than simple, small
Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS). This simplicity leads to a reduced risk of mechanical failure.

sUAS operated by RD Group carry no flammable fuel, no weapons systems or combustible
materials onboard. The risk of fire is virtually eliminated. Manned aircraft are at a constant risk
of in-flight fire or fire in the event of an incident or accident.

When operated by a properly trained and qualified flight crew [Flight Operator (pilot) and Visual
Observer (VO)], within approved operating parameters and an intelligent flight control system
the sUAS is safer than a certified aircraft (for the type of operations RD Group is requesting this
exemption for) due to its small size, lightweight and slow flight speed.

sUAS operated by RD Group within the operating parameters outlined herein provide an
equivalent level of safety as a certified manned aircraft.

Public Interest

Today's current methods of commercial aerial photography and commercial aerial inspection
require the use of a certified manned aircraft or a certified manned helicopter and a pilot with a
FAA Commercial Pilot License. A low flying aircraft or a low altitude helicopter (operating in
strict compliance with existing FAA regulations) hovering and circling over a small confined area
creates an inherent safety risk. It can often create a nuisance of noise pollution in the affected
area as well.

RD Group is permitted by law to utilize (sUAS) in many international countries for commercial
operations. However in the United States (our country of residency and citizenship) we are only
permitted to fly a sUAS for hobby or for recreational purposes only.

                                       For the Good of the Public

These regulatory restrictions create an economic hardship for RD Group.

Granting this requested exemption will be in the public interest because of:

     1) The increased level of safety that is afforded by the use of RD Group sUAS vs. the use
            of a certified manned aircraft or a certified manned helicopter:

     2) Because of the economic relief that it will provide to RD Group and its employees.
     3) Because of the positive economic impact it will provide to the community.
     4) Will provide an economic benefit to American Citizens.
     5) Because of the reduction in the number of aircraft in the NAS.
     6) Because of the reduction in the level of aircraft noise for persons on the ground.
Granting this Section 333 exemption request for RD Group for commercial operation of sUAS
within the operating parameters outlined herein is in the public interest.

Privacy

All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area, at altitude of less than 400 feet AGL and
over private or controlled property with permission of the property owner.

sUAS operated by RD Group within the operating parameters outlined herein present no risk to
the privacy of the public.

National Security

sUAS do not pose a risk to national security because of:
     1) Requirement for the FAA for the sUAS Flight Operator (Pilot) to hold a FAA Private Pilot
            Certificate
            a) Pilots Certificated by the FAA are subject to security screening by the Department
                  of Homeland Security.
     2) Due to their small size (less than 6 Lbs.)
     3) Due the tightly controlled area of sUAS operation.
            a) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area over private or controlled
                  property with permission of the property owner.
     4) sUAS carry no flammable fuel onboard.
     5) sUAS carry no weapon systems onboard.
     6) sUAS carry no combustible materials onboard.

sUAS operated by RD Group within the operating parameters outlined herein present no risk to
national security.

             This Section 333                          Document No.: DP1001
        Exemption request may                       Initial Release: 29 Sep 2014

                                       For the Good of the Public

Conclusion

Existing FAA Regulations burden RD Group's sUAS operations by preventing RD Group from
performing commercial sUAS operations to conduct aerial video and photography services for
real estate and construction, surveying and inspection, marine and wildlife, agriculture and for
special events
As we have clearly shown, commercial operation of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) by
RD Group with the sUAS Aircraft, sUAS Flight Crew, sUAS Operating Parameters, sUAS
Maintenance and sUAS training requirements as outlined in this request for relief:

     1) Will provide an equivalent level of safety as certified manned aircraft.
     2) Will not adversely affect safety in the National Airspace System
     3) Will reduce airspace congestion.
     4) Will reduce airborne noise.
     5) Will not pose a hazard the public
     6) Will present no risk to the privacy of the public
     7) Will present no risk to national security.
     8) Will provide an economic benefit to American Citizens.
     9) Is in the interest of the public.
The FAA's authority to issue exemptions from current operating rules and regulations, and the
Secretary's authority granted by section 333 of P.L. 112-95 (Special Rules for Certain
Unmanned Aircraft Systems) provides an opportunity to authorize certain sUAS operations into
the National Airspace System (NAS) prior to implementation of the final sUAS rule.
Granting this Section 333 exemption request for RD Group for commercial operation of sUAS
within the operating parameters outlined herein IS in the public interest.
RD Group has shown just cause exist for the FAA to grant relief from these Federal Aviation
Regulations.

Thank you,
