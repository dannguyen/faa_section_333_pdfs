                                                           Exemption No. 12009
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015-1466

Mr. Justin S. Schneider
Aerial Indigo, LLC
2543 East 50th Avenue
Anchorage, AK 99507

Dear Mr. Schneider:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 27, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Aerial Indigo, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial survey
and photography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the 3D Robotics X8+ and 3D Robotics Solo.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
                                                                                                                 2

aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Aerial Indigo, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Aerial Indigo, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the 3D Robotics X8+
    and 3D Robotics Solo when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
    Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
    amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Request for Exemption Per PL 112-95 §333 from 14CFR 21 Part H, 14CFR 61.3,
14CFR 61.113, 14CFR 91.119, 14CFR 91.121, 14CFR 91.151, 14CFR 91.405, 14CFR
91.407, 14CFR 91.409, 14CFR 91.417

         Please consider this a request for an exemption of the above applicable sections of 14
CFR for Aerial Indigo, LLC (hereafter `Aerial Indigo') for the purpose of conducting
commercial aerial survey and photography operations with its small Unmanned Aircraft System
(sUAS) within United States airspace. The employment of sUAS platforms for these missions
should provide the FAA with good cause to find that these operations enhance safety by
eliminating the need to use conventional aircraft in the sometimes unique environments where
a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) would be particularly adept, but a conventional
aircraft may pose a hazard to its crew and those on the ground.

         Aerial Indigo requests exemption from the following applicable regulations, pursuant to
the Administrator's authority to grant exemptions contained in 49 U.S.C. §106(f), 40113,
and 44701:

AIRCRAFT
       Aerial Indigo will operate variations of the 3D Robotics X8+, and the 3D Robotics Solo.

These are commercially available, off-the-shelf UAS. These UAS will weigh no more than 7.5
pounds and will operate no faster than 40 knots groundspeed. They are agile, having the
ability to hover, and move about its three axes simultaneously. Because of the sUAS's
specifications and flight characteristics, it poses no threat to national security.

AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATION

        The UAS operated by Aerial Indigo will undergo an inspection prior to each flight to
ensure airworthiness. Any damage or malfunction that poses a hazard to flight will be
documented and corrected prior to operation. The UAS carries neither a pilot nor passenger,
carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exclusively within visual
line of site of the operator. Operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and
monitored by the operator. By nature of these conditions, this UAS provides a greater degree
of safety to the public and property owners than conventional operations conducted with
airworthiness certificates issued under 14CFR Part 21.

UAS PAYLOAD

         Specific payload configurations will vary depending on the mission requirements. In
general, the payload will include a camera and gimbal system, and may include other sensors
necessary for the mission. The UAS will be operated in accordance with manufacturer
specifications, not to exceed a total weight of 7.5 lbs. Every flight payload will be
documented in the aircraft log. Without a manufacturer's approved modification, the UAS will
not be operated outside parameters set forth in the manufacturer's handbook.

                                                                                                         2|Page
FUEL REQUIREMENTS
(14 CFR 91.151)

         The sUAS is powered by a battery, which provides up to 30 minutes of powered flight.
Because of the absence of flammable operating fluids, the sUAS does not pose the same level
of risk as a conventional aircraft. All Aerial Indigo operators will terminate flights when
remaining battery power level reaches 20%, or 30 minutes flight time is reached, whichever
comes first after takeoff.

       Since no flights conducted by Aerial Indigo will require traditional petroleum based fuel,
and those flights will be for less than 30 minutes, Aerial Indigo requests relief from 14CFR
91.151.

PREFLIGHT ACTION

         Prior to each flight, the operator must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine
the sUAS is in a safe condition for flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the inspection
reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the sUAS, the aircraft is prohibited from
operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the sUAS is found to be in
a condition for safe flight.

         After the pre-flight inspection, the operator will conduct a pre-flight safety briefing
with the observer and all other participants.

MAINTENANCE
(14CFR 91.405, 14CFR 91.407, 14CFR 91.409, 14CFR 91.417)

        Aerial Indigo requests exemption from 14CFR 91.405, 14CFR 91.407, 14CFR 91.409,
14CFR 91.417.

        Aerial Indigo will conduct all maintenance on the sUAS in accordance with the flight
operations manual, pilot operating handbook, and any guidance received from the
manufacturer. Aerial Indigo will abide by all notices from the manufacturer governing the
maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alterations of the sUAS.

         There is no certified FAA inspection process for sUAS's, therefore all inspections will
be conducted by Aerial Indigo associates in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines. These
inspections will be conducted and documented after any maintenance and before every flight.
A functional flight test will be conducted after maintenance and before any flight for hire.

                                                                                                         3|Page
UAS CONTROL

         The control of the X8+ will be through a Radio Transmitter and Receiver provided by
the manufacturer and operating on frequency 915 Mhz. This frequency is FCC approved and
provides more than adequate range for operations within line of sight of the operator. Control
of the 3D Robotics SOLO will be through the dedicated Wi-Fi link provided by the
manufacturer. The UAS is also equipped with flight telemetry radios for semi-autonomous
operation using highly precise GPS data, while maintaining a constant link between the vehicle
and the ground station. The semi-autonomous mode is similar to a small manned aircraft
operating with a 3 axis autopilot; operator input is still a function of the system. (Lost link
procedures still apply)

CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CRM)

        All Aerial Indigo flight crew members will actively practice CRM in accordance with
FAA guidelines. Further guidance and details are covered in the Aerial Indigo training
program.

FLIGHT CREW
(14CFR 21 Part H, 14CFR 61.3, 14CFR 61.113)

        All flight crew members will successfully complete the Aerial Indigo training program
and operators will hold a valid driver's license or third class medical certificate. The Aerial
Indigo Operator will remain the individual in charge of each flight and will not transfer
responsibility for operational control of the sUAS aircraft to any other person, unless the
flight is specifically for training purposes and not for hire. Any flight for training purposes will
include a visual observer that is fully qualified for that position.

        The Visual Observer will be trained in accordance with the Aerial Indigo training
program and will possess a current valid driver's license issued in the United States.

                                                                                                         4|Page
        Aerial Indigo requests an exemption from 14CFR 21 Part H until such a time that it
has been established that the Aerial Indigo training program is capable of full compliance with
the regulation (Number of successful graduates, certification of instructors, etc).

TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION
(14CFR 61.3 and 14CFR 61.113)

        All flight crew members will successfully complete the Aerial Indigo training program
and operators will hold a valid driver's license or third class medical certificate. The Aerial
Indigo training program has been developed referencing the curriculum already in place by the
U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) for training their sUAV pilots. This curriculum is currently
accepted by the FAA as valid for the initial qualification of sUAS operators as a replacement
for a pilot license. The full Aerial Indigo training program is proprietary in nature and is
available to the Administrator upon request. Prior to operations for hire, the PIC must have
accumulated and logged a minimum of 5 hours of total time as a sUAS pilot with similar sUAS
type (fixed wing or rotary). The operator will demonstrate proficiency in flying the UAS safely
in all modes and phases of flight prior to participating in any for-hire missions.

OPERATIONS
        Aerial Indigo operations utilize a sUAS in a manner that provides services not offered

by manned aircraft and enhances the level of safety beyond which can be accomplished by
manned aircraft. Examples of the proposed aerial photography operations include general
photography, real estate, insurance damage assessment, and incident/accident documentation.
Most operations restrict the use of the sUAS to a small area typically encompassing a limited
number of residential and commercial properties at a time. The structures on these properties
provide sufficient protection from the sUAV, and photography can be completed with much
less risk than what would be incurred in a manned aircraft operation at low altitudes. Our
intended film production operation would typically include both photography and videography
for commercial purposes including wedding and corporate events. These events are restricted
to only the invited participants and are closed to the general public, providing the opportunity
to operate only in an area where informed, consenting participants and personnel are present.
Aerial Indigo will be able to provide a level of safety equal to or greater than the manned
aircraft that would typically provide these services.

         Finally, our survey operation includes the orthomosaic mapping of agriculture,
construction, and industrial sites utilizing our sUAS rotorcraft flying pre-programmed grids
that can be interrupted and returned to a safe landing zone by our operators at any time.
Currently these operations are executed by manned aircraft carrying hundreds of pounds of
fuel and equipment flying at low altitudes and speeds in excess of 75 miles per hour. Our
operation would greatly increase the level of safety, replacing manned aircraft with a sUAV
weighing less than 7.5 pounds which carries no fuel, and restricted to speeds no greater than

                                                                                                         5|Page
40 knots. These sites are areas that can readily be secured by Aerial Indigo personnel and will
not provide any additional risk to the general public.

         The UAS will be operated continuously within the operator's line of sight, so as not to
create a hazard to users of the NAS or public. In general, the UAS will be operated below
400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).

         We intend to occasionally operate in the vicinity of airports. The UAS will be
equipped with a Sagetech XPG-TR transponder, which is a Mode S transponder with ADS-B
out capability. We will also have a ICOM IC-A14 radio. During operations at uncontrolled
airports, we will be broadcasting on the appropriate CTAF frequency and listening to
transmissions of other aircraft, yielding right-of-way to other aircraft at all times. During
operations near controlled airports, we will obtain permission from air traffic control (ATC)
prior to the operation. We will maintain two-way communication with ATC at all times during
the operation; complying with any and all ATC instructions, and able to abort the operation
at any time at ATC request. During operations in controlled airspace, we request permission
to operate above 400ft AGL with ATC permission.

Summary

        Aerial Indigo intends to comply with every applicable regulation to the operation of the
sUAS. Each request for exemption has been made with the understanding that Aerial Indigo is
able to conduct operations that are at least as safe as or safer than those commercial
operations that currently are conducted by manned aircraft.

        Aerial Indigo's proposed exemptions and operational limitations are very closely
aligned with other exemptions already granted, and also with pending proposed 14 CFR
§91.107, which is specific to the operation of `micro' unmanned aircraft. The proposed 14
CFR §91.107 has been attached for reference.

                                                                                                         7|Page
         Although the sUAS is above the weight restrictions for the proposed rule, it is
applicable in nearly every other instance. In the event that 14 CFR §91.107 becomes
effective, Aerial Indigo will be submitting a request to operate within those guidelines with
minor exemptions to be addressed at a later date.

         I appreciate your assistance with this process, as I am aware of the massive
undertaking that these exemption requests are. Please contact me at your convenience with
any questions regarding this request.

                                                   Thank You,

          Prior to any operation under this part, the operator shall send written notification to the FAA evidencing
          the test results together with the operator's name and contact information, which submission the
          Administrator will acknowledge in writing as constituting the operator's micro unmanned aircraft pilot
          certificate for purposes of 49 USC § 44711. This subsection shall not apply to micro unmanned aircraft
          systems operated as public aircraft.
     c) The FAA may pursue investigation and enforcement procedures set out in part 13 with respect to the
          operator of a micro unmanned aircraft systems, including potential suspension or revocation of a micro
          unmanned aircraft pilot certificate held by its operator.
     d) Any other FAA pilot certificate that has as a requisite a written airman knowledge test may, if said
          certificate is current and in good standing, serve as a micro unmanned aircraft pilot certificate under
          subsection (b) even if the operator is unable to provide evidence of his or her written test results. Such
          pilot certificates will constitute the operator's micro unmanned aircraft pilot certificate for purposes of 49
