                                                           Exemption No. 12866
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2158

Mr. Nathan Limback
50 Obsidian Loop
Los Alamos, NM 87544

Dear Mr. Limback:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 27, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. You requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct
aerial videography/cinematography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
                                                                                                                 2

14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Nathan Limback is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Nathan Limback is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
         weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
         aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners

Dear  Sir  or  Madam,  
  
I,   Nathan   Limback,   am   writing   pursuant   to   the   FAA  
Modernization   and   Reform   Act   of   2012   and   the   procedures  
contained   within   14   C.F.R.   11,   to   request   that   I,   Nathan  
Limback,  an  owner  and  operator  of  small  unmanned  aircraft,  be  
exempted  from  the  Federal  Aviation  Regulations  ("FARs")  listed  
below   so   that   I,   Nathan   Limback,   may   operate   my   small   ultra  
light  weight  unmanned  aircraft  system  ("UAS")  commercially  in  
airspace   regulated   by   the   Federal   Aviation   Administration  
("FAA").  
  
As   described   herein   I,   Nathan   Limback,   am   a   licensed   private  
pilot  within  the  State  of  New  Mexico  with  a  current  Third  Class  
Medical;   experienced   in   flying   hobby   helicopters,   fixed   wing  
planes   and   quad-copters   for   recreational   purposes.   I   have  
added   a   professional   grade   quad-copter   UAS   to   my   inventory  
with   intent   for   aerial   videography/cinematography   to   enhance  
academic   community   awareness   for   those   individuals   and  
companies   unfamiliar   with   the   geographical   layout   of   the   New  
Mexico  area,  and  augment  aerial  pictures  and  videos;  following  
exemption   and   approval   by   the   FAA.   Thereby   enhancing   their  
academic   research   experience   for   the   Northern   New   Mexico  
area.  
  
I   have   flown   small   and   large-scale   RC(Radio   Control)   electric  
helicopters,   planes   and   quad-copters   for   over   twenty   five   (25)  
years  without  incident.  Committed  to  safety  with  each  flight.  I,  
Nathan   Limback's,   exemption   request   would   permit   operation  
of  ultra  lightweight,  unmanned  (piloted  by  remote  control)  and  
comparatively   inexpensive   UAS(s)   in   tightly   controlled   and  
limited   airspace.   Conducting   predetermined   operation   in   areas  
away   from   general   public,   airports,   heliports   and   vehicular  
traffic   for   community   videos,   and   within   property   boundaries  
for   individual   homeowner   real   estate   listing   videos/photos.  
Currently,   similar   lightweight,   remote   controlled   UAS's   are  
legally   operated   by   unmonitored   amateur   hobbyists   with   no  
safety   plan   or   controls   in   place   to   prevent   catastrophe.   I,  
Nathan   Limback,   have   personally   instilled   safety   protocols   and  
controls   in   the   form   of   pre-flight   and   post-flight   check   list      to  
avoid   and   prevent   public   hazard,   as   well   as   manned   aircraft  
hazards/catastrophe.   This   will   act   to   further   safety   protocols  
exclusive   to   lightweight   UAS's   specific   to   real   estate   video   and  
photography  usage  as  I,  Nathan  Limback,  record  flight  data  and  
other   information   gained   through   permitted   flight   operations  
to   share   with   the   FAA   through   any   required   FAA   reports   to  
assist  with  future  protocol  and  safety  regulation.  
  
Granting   my,   Nathan   Limback's,   request   comports   with   the  
Secretary   of   Transportation's   (FAA   Administrator's)  
responsibilities   and   authority   to   not   only   integrate   UAS's   into  
the   national   airspace   system,   but   to   "...establish   requirements  
for   the   safe   operation   of   such   aircraft   systems   [UAS's]   in   the  
national   airspace   system"   under   Section   333(c)   of   the   Reform  
Act  specific  to  the  use  of  UAS's  for  real  estate  purposes.  Further  
I,   Nathan   Limback,   will   conduct   my   operations   in   compliance  
with  the  protocols  described  herein  or  as  otherwise  established  
by   the   FAA.   For   the   reasons   stated   below   I,   Nathan   Limback,  
respectfully   request   the   grant   of   an   exemption   allowing   me   to  
operate   ultra   light   weight,   remote   controlled   UAS's   for  
academic  community  awareness  to  benefit/stimulate  attraction  
to   the   New   Mexico   area   and   to   enhance   real   estate   listing  
videos   for   homeowners   who   cannot   afford   expensive   manned  
aircraft  for  the  same  purpose.  Both  of  which  will  promote  local  
economic   growth   through   increased   employment   and  
increased   tax   base.   Both   with   public   safety   in   mind   by   keeping  
heavier   manned   aircraft   containing   combustible   fuel   that   that  
poses  potential  public  hazard.

III.   The   Extent   of   relief   Nathan   Limback   seeks   and   the   Reason  
He  Seeks  Such  Relief:  
  
I,   Nathan   Limback,   submit   this   application   in   accordance   with  
the  Reform  Act,  112  P.L.  95  §§  331-334,  seeking  relief  from  any  
currently   applicable   FARs   operating   to   prevent   me,   Nathan  
Limback,   contemplated   commercial   cinematic,   academic   and  
other  flight  operations  within  the  national  airspace  system.  The  
Reform  Act  in  Section  332  provides  for  such  integration  of  civil  
unmanned  aircraft  systems  into  our  national  airspace  system  as  
it   is   in   the   public's   interest   to   do   so.   My,   Nathan   Limback's,  
ultra  light  weight  UAS  meets  the  definition  of  "small  unmanned  
aircraft"  as  defined  in  Section  331  and  therefore  the  integration  
of   my   ultra   light   weight   UAS   is   expressly   contemplated   by   the  
Reform   Act.   I   would   like   to   operate   my   ultra   light   weight   UAS  
prior   to   the   time   period   by   which   the   Reform   Act   requires   the  
FAA   to   promulgate   rules   governing   such   craft.   Thereby,  
providing  direct  experience  and  valuable  information  for  formal  
regulation  that  can  be  administered  uniformly  to  all  real  estate  
commercial   related   UAS   aerial   video   and   photography.   The  
Reform   Act   guides   the   Secretary   in   determining   the   types   of  
UAS's   that   may   operate   safely   in   our   national   airspace   system.  
Considerations   include:   The   weight,   size,   speed   and   overall  
capabilities   of   the   UAS's;   Whether   the   UAS   will   be   operated  
near  airports  or  heavily  populated  areas;  and,  Whether  the  UAS  
will   be   operated   by   line   of   sight.   112   P.L.   95   §   333   (a).   Each   of  
these   items   reflect   in   favor   of   an   exemption   for   me,   Nathan  
Limback.   My   UAS   utilizes   four   (4)   counter-rotating   propellers  
for  balance,  control  and  stability.  My  UAS  is  equipped  with  GPS  
and  auto  return  safety  technology.  Weighing  less  than  ten  (10)  
pounds   (far   below   the   maximum   55   pound   limit);   including  
camera  with  gimbal.  
  
I,  Nathan  Limback,  consider  safety  as  foremost  with  each  flight.  
My   small   unmanned   aircraft   is   designed   to   hover   in   place   via  
GPS   and   operate   in   less   than   a   21   knot   (25   mph)   wind.   For  
safety,   stability   and   fear   of   financial   loss   I   will   not   fly   in   winds  
exceeding   15   mph.   Built   in   safety   systems   include   a   GPS   mode  
that   allows   my   UAS   to   hover   in   place   when   radio   controls   are  
released,   a   build   in   restricted   flight   zone   limiting   the   altitude  
and   radial   vicinity   the   quad-copter   can   fly   within   an   active  
airport.   With   three   modes   to   choose   from,   I   utilize   the   P-GPS  
mode   for   aerial   videography/photography.   This   is   the   safest,  
most  reliable  and  stable  mode  to  prevent  accident  and  hazard.  
When   pilot   communication   is   lost   this   UAS   is   designed   slowly  
return   to   the   point   of   take   off.   I   do   not   operate   my   UAS   near  
airports,  Hospitals  nor  Police  heliports,  and  do  not  operate  near  
areas   where   general   public   is   within   fifty   (50)   yards   depending  
on   location,   conditions   and   weather.   I   am   constantly   on   alert  
for   any   manned   aircraft   (Police/Medical   helicopters,   etc.)   and  
prepared   to   land/abort   immediately   to   the   nearest   and   safest  
ground  point  should  a  manned  aircraft  approach  my  location  or  
I   suspect   manned   aircraft   may   approach   near   my   location.   My  
UAS   is   capable   of   vertical   and   horizontal   operations,   and   are  
flown  only  within  my  line  of  sight  of  me,  as  the  remote  control  
pilot.   Utilizing   battery   power   rather   than   combustible   fuels,  
flights   generally   last   between   three   (3)   to   seven   (7)   minutes,  
with   an   altitude   under   two   hundred   (200)   feet.   I,   Nathan  
Limback,  utilize  a  fresh  fully  charged  battery  with  each  flight  as  
a   safety   precaution;   full   flight   time   limit   for   each   battery  
between   fifteen   (15)   to   twenty   (20)   minutes.   I   do   not   operate  
my  UAS  at  or  below  manufacture  recommend  minimum  charge  
levels   for   operation,   I   also   set   safety   alerts   in   the   DJI   Pilot   App  
for  30%  remaining  battery  useful  life  to  allow  sufficient  time  to  
return  to  the  takeoff  location  or  alternate  safe  landing  location;  
preferring   to   remain   well   within   a   safe   operating   range   to  
insure   adequate   communication   between   radio   control   and  
UAS   to   eliminate   potential   for   crash,   loss   of   control   or   hazard.  
Reserve   batteries   are   at   hand   with   each   exercise   to   insure  
replacement   for   sufficient   safe   level   of   operation.   I   do   not  
believe   in   taking   risk   that   may   cause   a   crash   that   could   create  
hazard   to   the   public/property/manned   aircraft,   and   have   no  
desire  to  lose  an  investment.  I  have  clocked  numerous  practice  
flights  in  remote  areas  as  a  hobbyist  simulating  flights  for  future  
commercial   use   to   gain   familiarization   with   the   characteristics  
of  this  specific  UAS's  performance  under  different  temperature  
and  weather  conditions.  I  also  practice  computerized  simulated  
flights  to  maintain  adequate  skills  and  response  reflex  time.  All  
for  the  sake  of  safety.  
  
I,   Nathan   Limback,   am   extremely   cautious   when   operating   of  
my   UAS/ultra   light   weight   unmanned   aircraft   and   will   not  
"create  a  hazard  to  users  of  the  national  airspace  system  or  the  
public."  112  P.L.  95  §  333  (b).  Given  the  small  size  and  weight  of  
my  UAS  it  falls  well  within  Congress's  contemplated  safety  zone  
when   it   promulgated   the   Reform   Act   and   the   corresponding  
directive   to   integrate   UAS's   into   the   national   airspace   system.  
Nathan   Limback's   UAS,   used   in   hobby   flight,   has   a  
demonstrable   safety   record   and   does   not   pose   any   threat   to  
the  general  public  or  national  security.  I  currently  have  over  five  
hundred   (500)   hours   as   PIC   of   various   sizes   and   types   of   Radio  
Control  (RC)  model  aircraft.  I,  Nathan  Limback  currently  have  a  
Private   Pilots   Certificate   with   a   current   Third   Class   Medical.   I  
also   posses   a   Amateur   Ham   Radio   License   which   allows   me   to  
have   the   background   and   understanding   of   radio   frequency  
propagation.   This   knowledge   with   allows   me   to   assess   and  
mitigate   interfering   geographical   and   atmospherically  
conditions   that   could   adversely   affect   the   communication  
between   the   UAS   and   Pilot   in   Command   (PIC).   I   currently   have  
fifteen  (8)  flight  hours  with  the  DJI  Inspire  1  UAS.  

           
  
  
IV.  How  Nathan  Limback's  Request  Will  Benefit  the  Public  As  A  
Whole:  
  
Aerial   videography   for   geographical   awareness   and   for   real  
estate   marketing   has   been   around   for   a   long   time   through  
manned   fixed   wing   aircraft   and   helicopters.   For   small   budget  
real  estate  companies  and  average  homeowners  the  expense  of  
such   aerial   videography   is   cost   prohibitive.   Only   large  
companies   and   high   end   Realtors   or   luxury   homeowners   can  
afford   to   absorb   such   expense.   Depriving   non-luxury  
homeowners   and   lower   budget   Realtors   from   a   valuable  
marketing   tool.   Manned   aircraft   pose   a   threat   to   the   public  
through   potential   catastrophic   crash.   My,   Nathan   Limback's,  
UAS  pose  no  such  threat  since  size  and  lack  of  combustible  fuel  
alleviates   any   potential   threat   to   the   public.   Congress   has  
already  proclaimed  that  it  is  in  the  public's  interest  to  integrate  
commercially   flown   UAS's   into   the   national   airspace   system,  
hence   the   passing   of   the   Reform   Act.   Granting   my,   Nathan  
Limback's,   exemption   request   furthers   the   public   interest  
through   academic/visual   awareness   of   the   geographical  
benefits  in  and  around  the  Northern  New  Mexico  area.  My  ultra  
light   weight   UAS   is   battery   powered   and   creates   no   emissions  
that   can   harm   the   environment.   The   consequence   of   my   ultra  
light  weight  UAS  crashing  is  far  less  than  a  full  size  helicopter  or  
fixed   wing   aircraft;   which   are   heavy,   contain   combustible   fuel  
and  can  cause  catastrophic  devastation  to  the  public.  
  
The   public's   interest   is   furthered   by   minimizing   ecological   and  
crash   threat   by   permitting   aerial   video/photo   capture   through  
my   battery   operated   ultra   light   weight   UAS's.   Permitting   me,  
Nathan   Limback,   to   immediately   fly   within   national   air   space  
furthers   economic   growth.   Granting   my   exemption   request  
substantially  furthers  the  economic  impact  for  the  New  Mexico  
community   for   companies   looking   to   relocate   or   build   in   the  
New   Mexico   area   as   well   as   individuals   looking   to   relocate   for  
career   advancement   through   academic   and   geographical  
awareness.   Both   of   which   serve   as   a   stimulus   to   the  
community.  
  
V.   Reasons   Why   Nathan   Limback's   Exemption   Will   Not  
Adversely  Affect  Safety  Or  How  The  Exemption  Will  Provide  a  
Level  of  Safety  At  Least  Equal  To  Existing  Rule:  
  
My,   Nathan   Limback's,   exemption   will   not   adversely   affect  
safety.   Quite   the   contrary,   for   the   reasons   stated   permitting  
me,   Nathan   Limback,   to   log   more   flight   time   in   FAA   controlled  
airspace,   with   communication   with   the   FAA,   will   allow   me   to  
contribute   to   the   innovation   and   implementation   of   new   and  
novel,   as   of   yet   undiscovered   safety   protocols   for   Aerial  
Photographers  that  can  be  embraced  by  the  NAR,  AAR,  and  TAR    
for   development   in   cooperation   with   the   FAA.   In   addition   I,  
Nathan   Limback,   submit   the   following   representations   of  
enhancements   to   current   aerial   videography   and   photography  
for  commercial  operations:  
  
My  UAS  weighs  less  than  10  pounds  complete  with  a  small  ultra  
light   weight   high   quality   4k   camera;   I   only   operate   my   UAS  
below  200  feet  (well  within  the  400  foot  permissible  ceiling  set  
by   the   FAA   Modernization   and   Reform   Act   of   2012);   my   UAS  
only  operate  for  7-10  minutes  per  flight;  I  land  my  UAS  prior  to  
manufacturer  recommended  minimum  level  of  battery  power;  
  

    · I   pilot   my   UAS   through   remote   control   only   by   line   of  
         sight;  

    · My   UAS   has   GPS   a   flight   safety   feature   whereby   it  
         returns   to   the   home   set   location   and   lands   if  
         communication  with  the  remote  control  pilot  is  lost;  

    · I   actively   analyze   flight   data   and   other   sources   of  
         information   to   constantly   update   and   enhance   safety  
         protocols;  

    · I  check  current  and  future  weather  condition  in  the  area  
         where  UAS  flight  will  be  conducted  and  also  monitor  K-
         Index   values   to   ensure   reliable   communication   with   my  
         UAS;  

    · I   only   operate   in   reasonably   safe   environment   that   are  
         strictly   controlled,   are   away   from   power   lines,   elevated  
         lights,  airports  and  actively  populated  areas;  

    · I   conduct   extensive   pre-flight   inspections   and   protocol,  
         during  which  safety  carries  primary  importance;  

    · I   always   obtains   all   necessary   permissions   prior   to  
         operation;  and,  

    · I   have   procedures   in   place   to   abort   flights   in   the   event  
         of  safety  breaches  or  potential  danger.  

  
My,   Nathan   Limback,   safety   protocols   provide   a   level   of   safety  
equal  to  or  exceeding  existing  rules.  It  is  important  to  note  that  
absent   the   integration   of   commercial   UAS   into   our   national  
airspace   system,   helicopters   are   the   primary   means   of   aerial  
video   and   photography   for   community   awareness.   While   the  
safety   record   of   such   helicopters   is   remarkably   astounding,  
there   has   been   local   incident   involving   loss   of   life   as   well   as  
extensive   property   damage;   it   is   far   safer   to   operate   a   battery  
powered  ultra  light  weight  UAS.  
  
First,  the  potential  loss  of  life  is  diminished  because  UAS's  carry  
no  people  on  board  and  I  only  operate  my  UAS  in  specific  areas  
away  from  mass  populations.  Second,  there  is  no  fuel  on  board  
a   UAS   and   thus   the   potential   for   fire   or   explosions   is   greatly  
diminished.   Third,   the   small   size   and   extreme   maneuverability  
of   my   UAS   allow   me   to   remotely   pilot   away   from   and   avoid  
hazards   quickly   and   safely.   Lastly,   given   its   small   size   and  
weight,   even   when   close   enough   to   capture   amazing   images,  
my  UAS  need  not  be  so  close  to  the  objects  they  are  focused  on  
through   the   technology   and   use   of   post   editing   software  
allowing  pan  and  zoom.  
  
Accordingly,   my   UAS   has   been   experimentally   operated   for  
familiarization/competency  and  will  continue  to  operate  at  and  
above  current  safety  levels.  
  
As   with   all   UAS   operation   I,   Nathan   Limback   with   always  
perform   every   flight   with   a   safety   spotter   familiar   with   the  
characteristic   and   capabilities   of   the   DJI   Inspire   1.   As   the   PIC   I  
will,   before   every   flight,   perform   preflight   using   a   laminated  
checklist,   post   warning   signs   in   the   close   vicinity   to   warn  
anyone  in  the  close  vicinity  that  aerial  photography  is  currently  
taking  place.  
  
  
VI.  A  Summary  The  FAA  May  Publish  in  the  Federal  Register:  
  
A.   14   C.F.R.   21   and   14   C.F.R.   91:   Airworthiness   Certificates,  
Manuals   and   The   Like.   14   C.F.R.   21,   Subpart   H,   entitled  
Airworthiness   Certificates,   sets   forth   requirements   for  
procurement   of   necessary   airworthiness   certificates   in   relation  
to   FAR   §   91.203(a)(1).   The   size,   weight   and   enclosed  
operational   area   of   my,   Nathan   Limback,   UAS   permits  
exemption   from   Part   21   because   my   UAS   meets   (and   exceeds)  
an   equivalent   level   of   safety   pursuant   to   Section   333   of   the  
Reform   Act.   The   FAA   is   authorized   to   exempt   aircraft   from   the  
airworthiness   certificate   requirement   under   both   the   Act   (49  
U.S.C.   §   44701   (f))   and   Section   333   of   the   Reform   Act.   Both  
pieces   of   legislation   permit   the   FAA   to   exempt   UAS's   from   the  
airworthiness   certificate   requirement   in   consideration   of   the  
weight,   size,   speed,   maneuverability   and   proximity   to   areas  
such   as   airports   and   dense   populations.   My,   Nathan   Limback,  
current   and   projected   UAS's   meet   or   exceed   each   of   the  
elements.  
  
14   C.F.R.   91.7(a)   prohibits   the   operation   of   an   aircraft   without  
an   airworthiness   certificate.   As   no   such   certificate   will   be  
applicable   in   the   form   contemplated   by   the   FARs,   this  
Regulation   is   inapplicable.      14   C.F.R.   §   91.9   (b)   (2)   requires   an  
aircraft   flight   manual   in   the   aircraft.   As   there   are   no   on   board  
pilots   or   passengers,   and   given   the   size   of   the   UAS's,   this  
Regulation   is   inapplicable.   An   equivalent   level   of   safety   will   be  
achieved   by   maintaining   a   safety/flight   manual   delineating  
areas   of   where   safety   can   be   defined.   The   FAA   has   previously  
issued   exemptions   to   this   regulation   in   Exemption   Nos.   8607,  
8737,  8738,  9299,  9299A,  9565,  9565B,  10167,  10167A,  10602,  
10700  and  32827.  14  C.F.R.  §  91.121  regarding  altimeter  settings  is  

inapplicable   insofar   as   my   UAS   utilizes   electronic   global   positioning  
systems  with  a  barometric  sensor.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §  91.203  (a)  and  (b)  provides  for  the  carrying  of  civil  aircraft  
certifications   and   registrations.   They   are   inapplicable   for   the   same  
reasons   described   above.   The   equivalent   level   of   safety   will   be  
achieved   by   maintaining   any   such   required   certifications   and  
registrations  by  me,  Nathan  Limback.  
  
B.   14   C.F.R.   §   45.23:   Marking   of   The   Aircraft.   Applicable   Codes   of  
Federal  Regulation  require  aircraft  to  be  marked  according  to  certain  
specifications.   My   UAS   are,   by   definition,   unmanned.   They   therefore  
do  not  have  a  cabin,  cockpit  or  pilot  station  on  which  to  mark  certain  
words   or   phrases.   Further,   two-inch   lettering   is   difficult   to   place   on  
such   small   aircraft   with   dimensions   smaller   that   minimal   lettering  
requirement.   Regardless,   I   will   mark   its   UASs   in   the   largest   possible  
lettering   by   placing   the   word   "EXPERIMENTAL"   on   its   fuselage   as  
required  by  14  C.F.R.  §45.29  (f)  so  that  I  the  pilot,  or  anyone  assisting  
me   as   a   spotter   with   the   UAV   will   see   the   markings.   The   FAA   has  
previously   issued   exemptions   to   this   regulation   through   Exemptions  
Nos.  8738,  10167,  10167A  and  10700.  
  
C.   14   C.F.R.   §   61.113:   Private   Pilot   Privileges   and   Limitations:   PIC.  
Pursuant  to  14  C.F.R.  §§  61.113  (a)  &  (b),  private  pilots  are  limited  to  
non-commercial   operations.   I,   Nathan   Limback,   have   a   Private   Pilots  
Certificate  and  current  Third  Class  Medical  Thus,  allowing  me,  Nathan  
Limback,   to   operate   my   UAS   exceeding   the   current   safety   levels   in  
relation  to  14  C.F.R.  §61.113  (a)  &  (b).  
  
D.   14   C.F.R.   91.119:   Minimum   Safe   Altitudes.   14   C.F.R.   §   91.119  
prescribes   safe   altitudes   for   the   operation   of   civil   aircraft.   It   allows  
helicopters   to   be   operated   at   lower   altitudes   in   certain   conditions.  
My  UAS  will  never  operate  at  an  altitude  greater  than  200  AGL;  safely  
below  the  standard  of  400  AGL.  I,  
Nathan   Limback,   will   however   operate   my   UAS   in   safe   areas   away  
from  public  and  traffic,  providing  a  level  of  safety  at  least  equivalent  
to   or   below   those   in   relation   to   minimum   safe   altitudes.   Given   the  
size,  weight,  maneuverability  and  speed  of  my  UAS,  an  equivalent  or  
higher  level  of  safety  will  be  achieved.  
  
E.   14   C.F.R.   91.405   (a);   407   (a)   (1);   409   (a)   (2);   417(a)   &   (b):  
Maintenance   Inspections.   The   above-cited   Regulations   require,  
amongst   other   things,   aircraft   owners   and   operators   to   "have   [the]  
aircraft   inspected   as   prescribed   in   subpart   E   of   this   part   and   shall  
between  required  inspections,  except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (c)  of  
this   section,   have   discrepancies   repaired   as   prescribed   in   part   43   of  
this   chapter.   .   .   ."   These   Regulations   only   apply   to   aircraft   with   an  
airworthiness   certificate.   They   will   not,   therefore,   apply   to   my,  
Nathan  Limback's,  UAS.  However,  as  a  safety  precaution  I  inspect  my  
UAS  before  and  after  each  flight.  

  
A  Summary  The  FAA  May  Publish  in  the  Federal  Register:  A.  14  
C.F.R.   21   and   14   C.F.R.   91:   Airworthiness   Certificates,   Manuals  
and   The   Like.   14   C.F.R.   21,   Subpart   H,   entitled   Airworthiness  
Certificates,   sets   forth   requirements   for   procurement   of  
necessary   airworthiness   certificates   in   relation   to   FAR   §  
91.203(a)(1).  The  size,  weight  and  enclosed  operational  area  of  
my   UAS   permits   exemption   from   Part   21   because   my,   Nathan  
Limback's,  UAS  meets  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  pursuant  to  
Section  333  of  the  Reform  Act.  The  FAA  is  authorized  to  exempt  
aircraft   from   the   airworthiness   certificate   requirement   under  
both   the   Act   (49   U.S.C.   §   44701   (f))   and   Section   333   of   the  
Reform  Act.  Both  pieces  of  legislation  permit  the  FAA  to  exempt  
UAS's   from   the   airworthiness   certificate   requirement   in  
consideration   of   the   weight,   size,   speed,   maneuverability   and  
proximity  to  areas  such  as  airports  and  dense  populations.  My  
UAS   meets   or   exceeds   each   of   the   elements.   14   C.F.R.   91.7(a)  
prohibits   the   operation   of   an   aircraft   without   an   airworthiness  
certificate.   As   no   such   certificate   will   be   applicable   in   the   form  
contemplated   by   the   FARs,   this   Regulation   is   inapplicable.   14  
C.F.R.   §   91.9   (b)   (2)   requires   an   aircraft   flight   manual   in   the  
aircraft.  As  there  are  no  pilots  or  passengers,  and  given  the  size  
of  the  UAS's,  this  Regulation  is  inapplicable.  An  equivalent  level  
of  safety  will  be  achieved  by  maintaining  a  manual.  The  FAA  has  
previously   issued   exemptions   to   this   regulation   in   Exemption  
Nos.   8607,   8737,   8738,   9299,   9299A,   9565,   9565B,   10167,  
maintenance   program   that   involves   regular   software   updates  
and   curative   measures   for   any   damaged   hardware.   Therefore,  
an  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  achieved.  
  
In   summary,   Nathan   Limback   seeks   an   exemption   from   the  
following  
Regulations:  
  
14   C.F.R.   21,   subpart   H;   14   C.F.R.   45.23(b);   14   C.F.R.   §§   61.113  
(a)  &  (b);  14  C.F.R.  §  91.7  (a);  14  C.F.R.  §  91.9  (b)(2);  14  C.F.R.  §  
91.103(b);   14   C.F.R.   §   91.109;   14   C.F.R.   §   91.119;   14   C.F.R.   §  
91.121;  14  C.F.R.  §  91.151(a);  14  C.F.R.  §§  91.203(a)  and  (b);  14  
C.F.R.  §  91.405  (a);  14  C.F.R.  §  91.407  (a)(1);  14  C.F.R.  §  91.409  
(a)(2);  14  C.F.R.  §  91.409  (a  )  (2);  and,  14  C.F.R.  §§  91.417  (a)  &  
(b)   to   commercially   operate   my,   Nathan   Limback,   small  
unmanned   vehicle/lightweight   unmanned   aircraft   vehicle   in  
community   awareness   and   real   estate   operations,   and   to  
develop   economic   platforms   for   real   estate   and   other   aerial  
needs   to   enhance   the   experience   of   those   seeking   to   relocate  
to   the   Northern   New   Mexico   Area.   Currently,   area   awareness  
and  aerial  videography/photography  relies  primarily  on  the  use  
of   larger   aircraft   running   on   combustible   fuel.   Posing   potential  
risk   to   the   public.   Granting   my,   Nathan   Limback's,   request   for  
exemption   will   reduce   current   risk   levels   and   thereby   enhance  
safety.  My  UAS  craft  do  not  contain  potentially  explosive  fuel,  is  
smaller,  lighter  and  more  maneuverable  than  conventional  real  
estate   video   and   photographic   aircraft   with   much   less   flight  
time.   Further,   I   operate   at   lower   altitudes   and   in   controlled  
airspace   eliminating   potential   public   risk   flying   to   and   from  
established   air   fields.   I,   Nathan   Limback,   have   been   informally  
analyzing   flight   information   and   will   compile   safety   protocols  
and  the  implementation  of  a  flight  operations  manual  for  usage  
that   exceeds   currently   accepted   means   and   methods   for   safe  
flight.  Formal  collection  of  information  shared  with  the  FAA  will  
enhance   the   FAA's   internal   efforts   to   establish   protocols   for  
complying  with  the  FAA  Modernization  and  Reform  Act  of  2012.  
There   are   no   personnel   on   board   my,   Nathan   Limback's,   UAS  
and  therefore  the  likelihood  of  death  or  serious  bodily  injury  is  
significantly  diminished.  My,  Nathan  Limback's,  operation  of  my  
UAS,   weighing   less   than   10   pounds   and   travelling   at   lower  
speeds   within   limited   areas   will   provide   an   equivalent   level   of  
safety   as   that   achieved   under   current   FARs.   Accordingly   I,  
Nathan   Limback,   respectfully   request   that   the   FAA   grant   my  
exemption   request   and   am   willing   to   cooperate   in   sharing  
information   to   benefit   the   FAA,   safety   of   manned   aircraft,   and  
the  general  public  at  large.

 Aircraft
  

  Flight Controller

  
  The Inspire 1's flight controller is based on DJI flight controller with several enhancements such as new

  flight mode and new safe mode. Three safe modes are available: Failsafe, Return Home and Dynamic

  Home Point. These features ensure the safe return of your aircraft if the control signal is lost. A flight

  recorder stores crucial flight data for each flight.

  

  Flight Mode

  
  Three flight modes are available. The details of each flight mode are found in the section below:
  P mode (Positioning) : P mode works best when GPS signal is strong. There are three different states of P

  mode, which will be automatically selected by the Inspire 1 depending on GPS signal strength and Vision
  Positioning sensors:

       P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both are available, and the aircraft is using GPS for positioning.

       P-OPTI: Vision Positioning is available but the GPS signal is not. Aircraft is using only Vision
       Positioning for hovering

       P-ATTI: Neither GPS or Vision Positioning available, aircraft is using only its barometer for positioning,
       so only altitude is controlled.
  A mode (Attitude): The GPS and Vision Positioning System is not used for holding position. The aircraft

  only uses its barometer to maintain altitude. If it is still receiving a GPS signal, the aircraft can automatically
  return home if the Remote Controller signal is lost and if the Home Point has been recorded successfully.
  F mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this mode. For more information
  about IOC, refer to the IOC in Appendix.

  

           Use the Flight Controller mode switch to change the flight mode of the aircraft, refer to the "Flight
           Mode Switch" on P27 for more information.

  

  Flight Status Indicator

     The INSPIRE 1 comes with the Front LED, Rear LED and Aircraft Status Indicator. The positions of these

  LEDs are shown in the figure below:

                                     Front LED  Rear LED

  

     The Front and Rear LED show the orientation of the aircraft. The Front LED displays solid red and the
     Rear LED displays solid green.

     Aircraft Status Indicator shows the system status of the flight controller. Refer to the table below for more
     information about the Aircraft Status Indicator:

  Return to Home (RTH)

  
  The Return to Home (RTH) brings the aircraft back to the last recorded Home Point. There are three cases

     that will trigger RTH procedure; they are Smart RTH, Low Battery RTH and Failsafe RTH.

                                        The Home Point is the location at which your aircraft takes off when the
                                          GPS signal is strong. You can view the GPS signal strength through
       
          Home Point                      the GPS icon ( ). If you are using the Dynamic Home Point

                                          setting, the Home Point will be updated to your current position as you

                                                 move around and when the Aircraft Status Indicator blinks green.

  

  Smart RTH

  

  Using the RTH button on the remote controller (refer to "RTH button" on P28 for more information) or the
  RTH button in the DJI Pilot app when GPS is available to enables smart RTH. The aircraft return to the
  latest recorded Home Point, you may control the aircraft's orientation to avoid collision during the Smart
  RTH. Press the Smart RTH button once to start the process, press the Smart RTH button again to exit
  Smart RTH and regain the control.

     Low Battery RTH

     The low battery level failsafe is triggered when the DJI Intelligent Flight Battery is depleted to a point that

     may affect the safe return of the aircraft. Users are advised to return home or land the aircraft immediately

     when these warnings are shown. DJI Pilot app will advise user to return the aircraft to the Home Point

     when low battery warning is triggered. Aircraft will automatically return to the Home Point if no action is

     taken after 10 seconds countdown. User can cancel the RTH by pressing once on the RTH button. The

     thresholds for these warnings are automatically determined based on the current aircraft altitude and its

     distance from the Home Point.

     Aircraft will land automatically if the current battery level can only support the aircraft to land to the ground

     from the current altitude. User can use the remote controller to control the aircraft's orientation during the

  landing process.

  
  The Battery Level Indicator is displayed in the DJI Pilot app, and is described below

When the critical battery level warning activates and the aircraft is descending to land

automatically, you may push the throttle upward to hover the aircraft and navigate it to a more
appropriate location for landing.

Color zones and markers on the battery level indicator reflect estimated remaining flight time

Failsafe RTH is activated automatically if remote controller signal (including video relay signal) is lost for

more than 3 seconds provided that Home Point has been successfully recorded and compass is working

normally. Return home process may be interrupted and the operator can regain control over the aircraft if

a remote controller signal is resumed.

              Aircraft cannot avoid obstruction during the Failsafe RTH, therefore it is important to set an
              reasonable Failsafe altitude before each flight. Launch the DJI Pilot app and enter "Camera"

              view and select "MODE" to set the Failsafe altitude.
              Aircraft will stop ascending and immediately return to the Home Point if you move the throttle
              stick if the aircraft reaches 20 m altitudes or beyond during Failsafe.

  

  Dynamic Home Point

  
  Dynamic home point is useful in situations when you are in motion and require a Home Point that is
  different from the takeoff point. GPS module is located at the position shown in the figure below:

                                                                                                                GPS

  

            Ensure the space above the GPS module is not obstructed when using Dynamic Home Point.

  Vision Positioning System

  
  DJI Vision Positioning is a positioning system that uses ultrasonic and image data to help the aircraft
  identify its current position. With the help of Vision Positioning, your Inspire 1 can hover in place more
  precisely and fly indoors or in other environments where there is no GPS signal available. The main
  components of DJI Vision Positioning are located on the bottom of your Inspire 1, including [1]two sonar
  sensors and[2]one monocular camera.

  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

                                                                                                           [2]

  

  

                                                                [1]

  

  Using Vision Positioning

  Vision Positioning is activated automatically when the Inspire 1 is powered on. No manual action is
  required. Vision Positioning is typically used in the indoor environment where no GPS is available. By
  using the sensors on the Vision Positioning system, Inspire 1 can perform precision hovering even when
  no GPS is available.

  

   © 2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.  16
   INSPIRE 1 User Manual
  

  Follow the steps below to use Vision Positioning:

  1. Toggle the switch to "P" as shown the figure to the right:
  2. Place the Inspire 1 on a flat surface. Notice that the Vision Positioning system

      cannot work properly on surfaces without pattern variations.

  3. Power on the Inspire 1. The aircraft status indicator will flash twice in green light,
      which indicates the Vision Positioning system is ready. Gently push the throttle up
      to lift off, and the Inspire 1 will hover in place.

  

            The performance of your Inspire 1's Vision Positioning System is subject to the surface you are
            flying over. The ultrasonic waves may not be able to accurately measure the distance over sound
            absorbing materials, and the camera may not function correctly in suboptimal environments. The
            aircraft will switch from "P" mode to "A" mode automatically if both GPS and Vision Positioning
            System are not available. So operate the aircraft cautiously when in any of the following situations:

              Flying over monochrome surfaces (e.g. pure black, pure white, pure red, pure green).
              Flying over a highly reflective surfaces.

              Flying at high speeds(over 8m/s at 2 meters or over 4m/s at 1 meter).
              Flying over water or transparent surfaces.
              Flying over moving surfaces or objects.

              Flying in an area where the lighting changes frequently or drastically.
              Flying over extremely dark (lux < 10) or bright (lux > 10,000) surfaces.
              Flying over surfaces that can absorb sound waves (e.g. thick carpet).
              Flying over surfaces without clear patterns or texture.
              Flying over surfaces with identical repeating patterns or textures (e.g. tiles with same design).

              Flying over inclined surfaces that will deflect sound waves away from the aircraft.

              In the event of loss of remote controller's signal, the aircraft will hover for 8 seconds and then
              auto-land if it is in "P" mode.
  
              Keep the sensors clean at all times. Dirt or other debris may adversely affect the effectiveness
              of the sensors.
              The effective hovering altitudes of the aircraft is from 0 to 2.5 meters.

              Vision Positioning system may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water.
              Vision Positioning system may not be able to recognize pattern on the ground in low light
              conditions (less than 100lux).

              Do not use other ultrasonic devices with frequency of 40 KHz when Vision Positioning system is
              in operation.
              Vision Positioning system may not be able to stabilize the aircraft when flying close to the
              ground (below 0.5 meters) in fast speed.
  
            Keep the animals away from the aircraft when Vision Positioning system is activated. The sonar

            sensor emits high frequency sound that is only audible to some animals.

  

  Flight Recorder

  
  Flight data is automatically stored in the internal storage device of the aircraft. User can gain access to

  these data through the DJI Pilot app. This includes flight duration, orientation, distance, aircraft status

  information, speed, and other parameters.
  

  Attaching and Detaching the Propellers

  
  Use only DJI approved propellers with your Inspire 1. The grey or black nut on the propeller indicates

  the rotation direction of the propeller and where it should be attached. To attach the propellers properly,

              Manually tighten each of the propellers on the corresponding motors to ensure it is attached firmly.

  
  Detaching the Propellers

  Hold the motor still. Then spin the propeller in the unlock direction indicated on the propeller itself.

  
  Detaching 1345s Quick-Release Propellers

  Press the 1345s Quick-Release propellers downward firmly then rotate the propeller in the unlock
  direction to unlock the propellers.

  

              Check that the propellers and motors are installed correctly and firmly before every flight.
              Ensure that all propellers are in good condition before each flight. DO NOT use old, chipped,

              or broken propellers.

              To avoid injury, STAND CLEAR of and DO NOT touch propellers or motors when they are spinning.

              ONLY use original DJI propellers for a better and safer flight experience.

Low Temperature Notice:

1. The performance of the intelligent Flight Battery is significantly reduced when flying in a low

temperature environments (those with air temperatures below 5). Ensure that the battery is fully

   charged and the cell voltage is at 4.43 V before each flight.
2. Using the Intelligent Flight Battery in extremely low temperature environments (those with air

temperatures below -10) is not recommended. When flying in environments with temperatures

between 5 and -10, the Intelligent Flight Battery should be able to achieve the appropriate voltage

levels (above 4.2 V), but it is recommended that you apply the included insulation sticker to the battery
in order to prevent a rapid drop in temperatures.

3. If the DJI Pilot app displays the "Critical Low Battery Level Warning" when flying in low temperature
   environments, stop flying and land the aircraft immediately. You will still be able to control the aircraft's
   movement when this warning is triggered.

4. Store the Intelligent Flight Battery in a room temperature environment and ensure that its temperature

exceeds 5 before using it in the low temperature environment.

5. When using the Inspire 1 in a low temperature environment, begin by allowing the aircraft to hover at a

low altitude, for approximately one minute, to heat the battery.

  6. To ensure optimum performance, keep the Intelligent Flight Battery's core temperature above 20

      when in use.

  

            In cold environments, insert the battery into the battery compartment and allow the aircraft to

            warm up for approximately 1-2 minutes before taking off.

            How to discharge your Intelligent Flight Battery:

            To effectively calibrate the battery capacity, it is recommended to charge and discharge the
            battery thoroughly for every 10 charge-and-discharge cycle. User should install the battery onto

            the aircraft and then power on the aircraft to initiate the discharge process, discharge the battery
            until the aircraft is powered off automatically. User should then fully charge the battery to ensure
            the battery is working at its optimal.
            Slow: Place the Intelligent Flight Battery into the Inspire 1's Battery Compartment and power it

                     on. Leave it on until there is less than 5% of power left, or until the battery can no longer
                     be turned on. Launch the DJI Pilot app to check battery level.
            Rapid: Fly the Inspire 1 outdoors until there is less than 5% of power left, or until the battery can
                     no longer be turned on.

               Remote Controller Profile

               

               The Inspire 1 Remote Controller is a multi-function wireless communication device that integrates the
               video downlink ground system and aircraft Remote Controller system. The video downlink and aircraft
               Remote Controller system operate at 2.4 GHz with maximum transmission distance of 2km. The remote
               controller features a number of camera functions, such as taking and previewing photos and video, and
               controlling gimbal motions. The remote controller is powered by a 2S rechargeable battery. The current
               battery level is displayed by LEDs on the front panel of the remote control.

               

                          Compliance Version: The Remote Controller is compliant with both CE and FCC regulations.
                          Operating Mode: Control can be set to Mode 1 , Mode 2.
                          Mode 1: The right stick serves as the throttle.
                          Mode 2: The left stick serves as the throttle.
               
                        Do not operate more than 3 aircrafts within in the same area (size equivalent to a soccer field) to
                        prevent transmission interference.

  P mode (Positioning) : P mode works best when GPS signal is strong. There are three different states of P            Controllers
  mode, which will be automatically selected by the Inspire 1 depending on GPS signal strength and Vision
  Positioning sensors:

       P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both are available, and the aircraft is using GPS for positioning.
       P-OPTI: Vision Positioning is available but the GPS signal is not. Aircraft is using only Vision
       Positioning for hovering
       P-ATTI: Neither GPS or Vision Positioning available, aircraft is using only its barometer for positioning,
       so only altitude is controlled.
  A mode (Attitude): The GPS and Vision Positioning System is not used for holding position. The aircraft

  only uses its barometer to maintain altitude. If it is still receiving a GPS signal, the aircraft can automatically
  return home if the Remote Controller signal is lost and if the Home Point has been recorded successfully.
  F mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this mode. For more information
  about IOC, refer to the IOC in Appendix.

  The Flight Mode Switch is locked in P mode by default. To unlock the switch, launch the DJI Pilot app,
  enter the "Camera" page, tap "MODE", and then activate "Multiple Flight Mode" .

  between the operator and the aircraft to achieve optimal transmission performance.                            Controllers

  
  Dual Remote Controllers Mode

  

  More than one remote controller can connect to the same aircraft in Dual Remote Controller mode. In

Dual Controllers mode, the "Master" remote controller operator controls the orientation of the aircraft, while
the "Slave" remote controller controls the movement of the gimbal and camera operation. When multiple

"slave" remote controllers (max of 6) are connect to the aircraft, only the first connected "slave" remote

controller is able to control the gimbal, the remaining "slave" remote controller can view the live feed video

  from the aircraft and set the camera parameters, but they cannot control the gimbal.

                         Follow Mode   The angle between Gimbal's orientation and aircraft's nose remains

                                       constant at all times. One user alone can control the pitch motion of the
                                        Gimbal, but a second user is required to control the pan motion using a
                                       second remote controller.

                         FPV Mode The Gimbal will lock to the movements of the aircraft to provide a First-
                                             Person-View flying experience.
                       

                          Free Mode     The Gimbal's motion is independent of the aircraft's orientation. One user
                                        alone can control the pitch motion of the Gimbal, but a second user is
                                        required to control the pan motion using a second remote controller.

                          Re-alignment  Tap to force the Gimbal orientation to re-align with aircraft's orientation
                                        by panning from gimbal's current orientation. Pitch angle will remain
                                        unchanged during the re-alignment.

          

                          Gimbal motor error may occur in these situations: (1) Gimbal is placed on uneven ground. (2)
                          Gimbal has received an excessive external force, e.g. a collision. Please take off from flat, open
                          ground and protect the gimbal after powering up.

                          Flying in heavy fog or cloud may make the gimbal wet, leading to a temporary failure. The
                          gimbal will recover when it dries out.

  Once pre-flight preparation is complete, it is recommended to use the flight simulator to learn how to fly
  safely. Ensure that all flights are carried out in a suitable location.

  
  Flight Environment Requirements

  
  1. Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speed exceeding 10m/s ,
      snow, rain and smog.

  2. Only fly in open areas. Tall buildings and steel structures may affect the accuracy of the on-board
      compass and GPS signal.

  3. Avoid from obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees or bodies of water.
  4. Minimize electromagnetic interference by not flying in area with high levels of electromagnetism,

      including mobile phone base stations or radio transmission towers.
  5. Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environment factor such as air density and temperature.

      Be very careful when flying 14700 feet (4500 meters) or more above sea level as battery and aircraft
      performance may be reduced.
  6. The Inspire 1 cannot operate within the polar areas in "P" mode.

    
  Flight Limits and Flight Restriction Area

  
  Flight limits on height and distance can be set. The details of these flight limits are described in the following
  section.
  All unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations as
  the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), FAA and their own national airspace regulations. For
  safety reasons, the flight limits function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and
  legally. The flight limits function includes height limits, distance limits and No Fly Zones.
  When operating in P Mode, height, distance limits and No Fly Zones work together to manage flight. In A
  mode only height limits work and flights cannot go higher than 120 meters.

  
  Max Height & Radius Limits

  Max Height & Radius limit flying height and distance, and the user may change these settings in the
  DJI Pilot App. Once complete, your Inspire 1 will fly in a restricted cylinder that is determined by these
  settings. The tables below show the details of these limits.

          No-Fly Zones

          

          All No-Fly Zones are listed on the DJI official website at http://flysafe.dji.com/no-fly. No-Fly Zones are
          divided into Airports and Restricted Areas. Airports include major airports and flying fields where manned
          aircraft operate at low altitudes. Restricted Areas include borders between countries or sensitive sites.

          The details of the No-Fly Zones are explained below:

          

          Airport:

          

          (1) Airport No-Fly Zones are comprised of Takeoff Restricted Zones and Restricted-Altitude Zones. Each
               zone features circles of various size.

          (2) R1 depends on the size and shape of the airport, and is an area around the airport that is a Takeoff

               Restricted Zone, inside of which take-off and flight is prevented.

          (3) From R1 to R1+1 mile around the airport, the flight altitude is limited on a 15 degree incline, starting at
               65 feet (20 meters) from the edge of airport and radiating outward. The flight altitude is limited to 1640
               feet (500 meters) at R1+1 mile.

          (4) When the aircraft is within 320 feet (100 meters) of the No-Fly Zones, a warning message will appear
               in the DJI Pilot app.

  (1) Restricted Areas do not have a flight altitude restriction.
  (2) R around the designated Restricted Area is a Take-off Restricted area. Aircraft cannot takeoff within

       this zone. The value of R varies depending on the definition of the Restricted Area.
  (3) A "warning zone" has been set around each Restricted Area. When the aircraft is within 0.6 miles (1

       km) of this zone, a warning message will appear in the DJI Pilot app.

  Preflight Checklist

  
  1. Remote controller, aircraft battery, and mobile device are fully charged.
  2. Propellers are mounted correctly and firmly.
  3. Micro-SD card has been inserted if necessary.
  4. Gimbal is functioning as normal.
  5. Motors can start and are functioning as normal.
  6. DJI Pilot app connected to the aircraft.

  

  
  Calibrating the Compass

  
  IMPORTANT: Make sure to calibrate the compass in every new flight location. The compass is very
  sensitive to electromagnetic interference, which can cause abnormal compass data leading to poor flight
  performance or even failure. Regular calibration is required for optimum performance.

  

             DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a chance of strong magnetic interference, such
              as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcements underground.
              DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
              phones.
              DO NOT calibrate beside massive metal objects.

  

  

  Calibration Procedures

  Choose an open space to carry out the following procedures.
  1. Ensure the compass is calibrated. If you did not calibrate the compass in the Checklist, or if you

      have changed your position since last calibrating it, tap "MODE" in the app and select "Compass
      Calibration" to calibrate the compass. Then follow the on-screen instructions.
  2. Hold and rotate the aircraft horizontally 360 degrees, and the Aircraft Status Indicator will display a
      solid green light.

   © 2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.  49
Flight     INSPIRE 1 User Manual

          

          3. Hold the aircraft vertically with nose pointing downward, and rotate it 360 degrees around the center
              axis. Recalibrate the compass if the Aircraft Status Indicator show solid red.

          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          

          

                    If the Aircraft Status Indicator blinks red and yellow after the calibration, move your aircraft to a
                    different location to carry out compass calibration.
          
                    Calibrate the compass before each flight. Launch DJI Pilot App, follow the on-screen instruction
                    to calibrate the compass.

          
          When to Recalibrate

          

          1. When compass data is abnormal, and the Aircraft Status Indicator is blinking red and yellow.

          2. When flying in a new location, or a location that is different from your last flight.

          3. When the mechanical structure of the Inspire 1 has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the
              compass.

          4. When severe drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the Inspire 1 does not fly in straight lines.

          

          Auto Take-off and Auto Landing

          
          Auto Take-off
          Use auto take-off to take off your aircraft automatically if the Aircraft Status Indicator displays blinking
          green. Follow the steps below to use auto take-off:

          1. Launch DJI Pilot app, enter "Camera" page.
          2. Ensure the aircraft is in "P" mode.

          3. Go through the pre-flight checklist.
          4. Tap" ", and confirm flight condition. Slide to confirm and take-off.
          5. Aircraft takes off and hovers at 1.5 meters above ground.

  Auto-Landing
  Use auto-landing to land your aircraft automatically if the Aircraft Status Indicator displays blinking green.
  Follow the steps below to use auto-landing:
  1. Ensure the aircraft is in "P" mode.
  2. Check the landing area condition before tapping " ", to perform landing.
  3. Aircraft lowers the landing gear and proceed to land automatically.

  

            Landing gear will automatically raise when the aircraft reaches an altitude of 1.2m for the first
            time, and automatically lower every time it descends to 0.8m. Users can turn this feature ON/OFF
            in the Pilot app.
  

  
  Starting/Stopping the Motors

  

  Starting Motors

  The Combination Stick Command (CSC) listed below are used to start the motors instead of simply push-
  ing the stick up. Ensure that you perform the CSC in one motion.

  
  

                                                                       OR
  

  
  

  Stopping Motors

  There are two methods to stop the motors.
  Method 1: When the Inspire 1 has landed, push the throttle down , then conduct CSC . Motors will stop
  immediately. Release both sticks once motors stop.

  Method 2: When the aircraft has landed, push the throttle down and hold. The motors will stop after 3
  seconds.

  

                                                                              OR

  
  
  
  

            Do not perform CSC when aircraft is in midair, otherwise the motors will be stopped.
  

  

  Flight Test

  

  Take off/Landing Procedures

  

  1. Place the aircraft on open, flat ground with battery indicators facing towards you.
  2. Power on the remote controller and your mobile device, then the Intelligent Flight Battery.
  3. Launch the DJI Pilot App and enter the Camera page.
  4. Wait until the Aircraft Indicator blinks green. This means the Home Point is recorded and it is safe to fly

      now. If it flashes yellow, it means Home Point is not recorded, and you should not take off.
  5. Push the throttle up slowly to take off or using Auto Take-off to take off.

          6. Shoot photos and videos using the DJI Pilot app.
          7. To land, hover over a level surface and gently pull down on the throttle slowly to descend.
          8. After landing, execute the CSC command or hold the throttle at its lowest position for 3 seconds or

              more until the motors stop.
          9. Turn off the Intelligent Flight Battery first, followed by the Remote Controller.

          

                      When the Aircraft Status Indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered Failsafe
                      mode.
                      A low battery level warning is indicated by the Aircraft Status Indicator blinking red slowly or

                      rapidly during flight.
                      Watch video tutorials about flight for more flight information.
          

          

          Video Suggestions and Tips

          

          1. Work through the checklist before each flight.
          2. Select desired gimbal working mode in the DJI Pilot app.
          3. Aim to shoot when flying in P mode only.

  Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC)

  
  IOC allows users to lock the orientation of aircraft in different fashions. There are three working modes for

     IOC and you may select the desired IOC modes from the DJI Pilot app. IOC only works under F mode,

     and user must toggle the flight mode switch to "F" mode to activate IOC. Refer to the table below:

                     Its forward direction is pointing to the nose direction when recording, which is
                     fixed until you re-record it or exit from CL.

   Course Lock (CL)

     Home Lock (HL)*  Record a Home Point (HP), and push Pitch stick to control the aircraft far from
                      or near to the HP.

                                     Point of Interest. Record a point of interest (POI), the aircraft can circle around
     Point of Interest (POI)* the POI, and the nose always points to the POI.

  

            *Home Lock and Point of Interest feature are coming soon.

  
  Prerequisites of IOC

  Use the IOC feature under the following condition:

  

     Modes IOC        GPS enabled      GPS                             Flight Distance Limits

  How to Update Firmware

  
  Follow the process described below to upgrade the aircraft, remote controller and battery.

  
  Updating the Aircraft Firmware

Step 1- Check Battery and SD Card Capacity

  Ensure the Intelligent Flight Battery has at least 50% power and there is at least 100MB of free space on

  the SD card.

  

  Step 2- Prepare the Firmware Update Package

  1. Download the firmware update package from the official DJI website (http://www.dji.com/product/
      inspire-1).

  2. Insert the SD into your PC. Extract the all downloaded files into the root directory of the SD card.
      Remove the SD card from your PC. Ensure the Inspire 1 is powered off then insert the SD card into the
      SD card slot on the Inspire 1 camera.

  

  Step 3- Update the Aircraft

1. Ensure the remote controller is powered off and then power on the aircraft. Upgrade will begin
   automatically after aircraft is powered on.

  2. It will take approximately 25 minutes to complete the firmware update. The camera will sound a short
      pulse of "D-D-D-D" beeping sound to indicate the upgrade is in progress and sound a "D---DD"
      beeping sound to indicate the update is complete with success.

  3. Check the upgrade status by opening the ".txt" file that is automatically generated after the update.

      The update is successful if the text "result: successful" is in the document. Try upgrading the firmware
      again if the text "result: failed" is found or the gimbal sound a long beep sound.

    

  Updating the Remote Controller Firmware

  Step 1- Check Battery and SD Card Capacity

  

  Remote controller firmware is included in the aircraft firmware update package. Use the same update

  package file that is downloaded from the DJI official website. Ensure the remote controller battery level is

  above 50%.

  

  Step 2- Prepare the Firmware Update Package

  

  1. Extract all downloaded files into the root directory of an SD card or USB thumb drive.
  2. Insert the SD card into a SD card reader or the USB disk onto the remote controller USB port when

      remote controller powered off. If you do not have a SD card reader, you may insert the SD card into

      the gimbal and connect the gimbal with remote controller to upgrade the remote controller.

  
  Step 3- Update the Remote Controller

1. Power on the remote controller and wait 60 seconds until the upgrade begins. Do not power off the
   remote controller during the update.

2. It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete the firmware update. The camera will sound a

  Updating Intelligent Flight Battery Firmware

  

  The Intelligent Flight Battery is upgraded during the aircraft firmware upgrade process. It is recommended
  to keep the upgrade package files in your SD card. The upgrade will start automatically after power
  cycling the aircraft.

  

              Do not perform firmware update while the aircraft is still flying in the air. Only carry out firmware
              update when the aircraft is landed.
              Be sure to update the remote controller's firmware to the latest version after you upgrade the aircraft's

              firmware.
              The remote controller may become unlinked from the aircraft after updating. Re-link the remote
              controller and aircraft.

              Confirm the update results according to the gimbal sounds. It is normal for the aircraft to sound or the
              LED to blink during the update process.

              Ensure there is only one firmware package file stored on your SD card.

              Only storage devices that are formatted for FAT32 and exFAT file systems are supported for aircraft
              and remote controller firmware updates.

              Delete any automatically generated txt files (xxx_GS.TXT) in the SD card when updating multiple
              remote controllers.

Inspire 1-Flight Limits and Flight
Restriction Area

Flight Limits and Flight Restriction Area

Flight limits on height and distance can be set. The details of these flight limits
are described in the following section. All unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations as the ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization), FAA and their own national airspace
regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits function is enabled by default to
help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height limits, distance limits and No Fly Zones. When operating in P Mode,
height, distance limits and No Fly Zones work together to manage flight. In A
mode only height limits work and flights cannot go higher than 120 meters.
Max Height & Radius Limits
Max Height & Radius limit flying height and distance, and the user may change
these settings in the DJI Pilot App. Once complete, your Inspire 1 will fly in a
restricted cylinder that is determined by these settings. The tables below show
the details of these limits.

  
  
  
  

Note:
 If you fly out of the limit, you can still control the Inspire 1, but cannot fly it

        further.
 If the Inspire 1 flies out of the max radius in Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode, it

        will fly back within range automatically.
Flight Restriction of Restricted Areas
Restricted areas include airports worldwide. All restricted areas are listed on the
DJI official website at http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-mc. Restricted areas
are divided into category A and category B. Category A areas cover major
international airport such as LAX and Heathrow, while category B areas includes
smaller airports.
Category A Safety Zone
(1) The category A "safety zone" is comprised of a small "no-fly zone" and a
range of "restricted-altitude zones". Flight is prevented in the "no-fly zone" but
can continue with height restrictions in the restricted-altitude zone. (2) 1.5 miles
(2.4 km) around a designated safety zone is a no-fly zone, inside which takeoff is
prevented.
(3) 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to 5 miles (8 km) around restricted areas are altitude
restricted, with maximum altitude going from 35 feet (10.5 m) at 1.5 miles (2.4
km) to 400 feet (120 m) at 5 miles (8 km).
(4) A "warning zone" has been set around the safety zone. When you fly within
320 feet (100m) of the safety zone, a warning message will appear on the DJI
Pilot App.

  
  
  
  

Category B Safety Zone
(1) Category B "safety zone" is comprised of a "no-fly zone" and a "warning
zone".
(2) 0.6 miles (1 km) around the safety zone is a designated "no-fly zone".
(3) A "warning zone" has been set around the safety zone. When you fly within
0.6 miles (1Km) of this zone, a warning will appear on the DJI Pilot App.

  
  
  
  

Reference:
Semi-automatic descent: All stick commands are available except the throttle
stick command during the descent and landing process. Motors will stop
automatically after landing.
Note:
 When flying in the safety zone, aircraft status indicator will blink red quickly and

        continue for 3 seconds, then switch to indicate current flying status and
        continue for 5 seconds at which point it will switch back to red blinking.
For safety reasons, please do not fly close to airports, highways, railway stations,
railway lines, city centers and other special areas. Try to ensure the aircraft is
visible.
