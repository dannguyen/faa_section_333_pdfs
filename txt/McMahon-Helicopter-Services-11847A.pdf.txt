                                                      Exemption No. 11847A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-1068

Mr. Nicholas McMahon
President
McMahon Helicopter Services, Inc.
Executive Heliport Building

Canton, MI 48187

Dear Mr. McMahon:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated June 17, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of McMahon Helicopter Services, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to conduct closed-set motion picture and television
filming.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                 2

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11847
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add closed-set motion picture and television filming to its UAS
operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11847 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 2 has been updated to permit closed-set motion picture and
television filming.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    permitted.

This exemption terminates on June 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Good afternoon Amanda and Nia,

I received our COA, however for some reason it is restricting us from conducting closed-set film
production operations. This was one of the UAS operations we have requested permission for. A
copy of our FAA approved Motion Picture & Television Manual was included with our
application documents and was labeled confidential. According to the requirements outlined in
your letter, this should satisfy that item as we already operate under that manual utilizing our
certified aircraft. Please let me know what additional information is needed (if any) to lift that
restriction from our COA.

Thank you,

Nick McMahon
President
