                                                           Exemption No. 12107
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0879

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
100 North LaSalle Street
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 30, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Helios Imaging, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct scripted
closed-set filming and construction inspections.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a Helios 960, a proprietary design based on the
Tarot 960 airframe.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1 and closed set motion picture and
filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-
0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon
Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety
achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner
and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater
proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find
that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Helios Imaging, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection
and closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to the conditions and
limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Helios Imaging, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Helios 960 when
         weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
         aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming
         are permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform
Act of 2012 and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of
14 C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform

Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of Helios
Imaging Inc. ("Helios"), an operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft ("UA") used for scripted,

closed-set filming for the motion picture and television industries and for the construction

industry. Specifically, applicant seeks an exemption from the Federal Aviation Regulations
("FARs") listed in Appendices A and B to allow commercial operation of its UA, so long as such

operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be

established by the FAA in a grant of this petition.

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the Helios
960, a proprietary design based on the Tarot 960 airframe, for scripted closed-set filming for (1)
the motion picture and television industries; and (2) the construction industry in Class G airspace
nationwide, or as otherwise prescribed in an Air Traffic Organization ("ATO") issued COA. The
UA operations contemplated by this petition, particularly the construction industry proposed use,
are in the public interest because they clearly satisfy the "Four D's" of exemplary uses of UAs: to
replace work that is dangerous, difficult, dull, or dirty, and at the same time provide an
equivalent or greater level of safety than alternative manned aircraft operations. The UA covered
by this petition is a small battery-powered craft, weighing approximately 18 lbs. (8 kg.),
inclusive of battery and payload. Operation of the UA under the strict conditions proposed below
will provide an equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended, while still allowing commercial
operations. Operations using this UA are far safer than conventional operations conducted with
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that weigh thousands of pounds, carry highly flammable fuel,
and operate in close proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure, and people.

         Congress directed the FAA to consider seven factors in deciding whether to approve
Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to

                                                          1

14 C.F.R. 409(a)(1) and (a)(2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to operate
commercially a small unmanned aircraft system (UA) (18 lbs. or less).

    Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the
    Helios 960, a propriety design, for scripted closed-set filming for (1) the motion
    picture and television industries and (2) the construction industry nationwide in Class
    G airspace nationwide, or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO issued COA. The
    requested exemption should be granted because operation of small UA, weighing
    approximately 18 lbs. (8 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the strict
    conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety, while still
    allowing commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the exemption
    are far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing
    aircraft weighing thousands of pounds and carrying highly flammable fuel, and
    operating in close proximity to the ground, power lines, transmission towers,
    pipelines, and people. The seven factors Congress directed the FAA to consider when
    approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational
    capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within
    visual line of sight ­ each support the request. In particular, the aircraft are small, and
    will operate at slow speeds, and close to the ground in order to more safely and
    efficiently conduct inspections that would otherwise involve a risk of death to the
    inspectors. The substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life,
    coupled with the low risk use of UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in
    favor of granting the exemption.

III. Proposed Operations

A. The UA

         The requested exemption will permit petitioner to operate the Helios 960, a proprietary
design, with a maximum weight of approximately 18 lbs. (8 kg.), inclusive of batteries and
technical payload. This rotorcraft operates at a speed of no more than 35 knots and has the
capability to hover and move in the vertical and horizontal planes simultaneously.

         The UA will use the following:

 GPS/Autopilot System: DJI WooKong-M, with its accompanying Main Controller (MC),
    Internal Measurement Unit (IMU), and GPS.

 Receiver: Futaba R6014HS 14-Channel 2.4GHz FASST
 Datalink: DJI iOSD Mark II 2.4 Ghz, which displays power voltage, flight velocity, height,

    distance from the home point, horizontal attitude and GPS satellite number acquired to make
    the location calculation.
 Transmitter 1 (Tx1): Futaba 14 MZ, used by the UA operator to control the UA
 Transmitter 2 (Tx2): Futaba 14 SG, used by the camera operator to control the gimbal and
    camera

         Please refer to Exhibits 1-12 for further information regarding the UA. Details regarding
the design and assembly of the UA are being submitted confidentially, due to the proprietary
nature of the UA. The petition and the supporting documentation in the Exhibits are hereinafter
referred to as the "operating documents."

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the characteristics of the
UA are numbers 1, 5, and 16-20 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or imposed by the
FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

B. The Crew

         The crew will consist of a pilot in command (PIC), a visual observer (VO), and a camera
operator (CO).

         The PIC, VO, and CO will have been trained in operation of UAs generally. The PIC is a
lifelong model aircraft hobbyist, with years of general UA experience. Additionally, the PIC will
have completed, at a minimum, 40 hours of UA flight training with this specific UA prior to
operations, and will be required to participate in annual training thereafter.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the training and
characteristics of the crew are numbers 3 and 6-9 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or

                                                          6
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

C. Flight Conditions

         The UA will be used for scripted closed-set filming for the motion picture and television
industries and the construction industry. It will be flown in Class G airspace nationwide under
200 feet above ground level ("AGL") and under controlled conditions over property that is
restricted as stated below under D. Flight Operations. Petitioner will work with the local FSDO
when planning operations. Petitioner will only operate its UA in visual meteorological conditions
(VMC). The UA will at all times be no less than 500 feet below and no less than 2,000 feet
horizontally from a cloud, and petitioner will not conduct operations unless visibility is at least 3
statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always make a safety assessment of the risk of
every operation, and will only operate when it is determined that no hazards are present.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the flight conditions in
which the UA will be operated are numbers 2, 4, 16, and 28-29 in Section V below. Each has
been adopted or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption
petitions.

D. Flight Operations

         The purpose of every UA flight will be to conduct safe, accurate, and efficient (i) scripted
closed-set filming for the motion picture and television industries or (ii) site inspections for the
construction industry in Class G airspace nationwide.

         The PIC will be responsible for flying the UA and will use a Futaba 14 MZ transmitter.
The PIC will have visual contact with the UA at all times and will have available on screen
display to observe telemetry data, including battery power and flight altitude. The on screen
display/telemetry information will also be available on an iPad. The main purpose of the iPad
with the telemetry information is to set an audio signal for when the voltage on the battery is
running low.

         The VO will be responsible for the overall safety of the operation. The VO will observe
the UA and flight operational area without any display monitors.

         The CO will use a Futaba 14SG transmitter to control the gimbal and the camera. The CO
will use an on screen display monitor to observe the camera data and change what is being
viewed.

         Prior to the day of an operation, the flight crew will conduct a site inspection. The flight
crew will look for obstructions in the filming or construction area, and determine a safe flight
plan. The flight crew will also make a note of any public access points in the general area, where
nonparticipating individuals could access the operational area. The flight crew will adapt their
flight plan to avoid these areas.

         On the day of an operation, the flight crew will cone off the flight operational area (if not
already roped off), up to ½ square miles. The only individuals allowed within the flight
operational area will be participants ­ actors, crew members, or construction workers. All other

                                                          7
nonparticipating individuals and vehicles will be outside the sectioned-off area. Prior to each
operation, the flight crew will conduct a safety briefing with all individuals who will be in the
flight operational area.

         The flight crew will set a "home area" that the UA will launch from and return to. The
area will have a ten-foot radius and be marked off with traffic cones. The flight crew will stand
outside this area. During operations, the flight crew will wear high visibility safety vests and
helmets. The three members of the flight crew will stand next to each other and be able to
communicate orally.

         The flight crew will conduct a pre- and post-flight inspection, as laid out in Helios's
Inspection Procedures, Exhibit 12. The flight crew will also conduct an inspection flight each
week, going through both the pre- and post-flight procedures to ensure that the Helios 960 is in a
safe condition.

         In the unlikely event of emergency or a lost link, the UA will be equipped with an
emergency "return to home" feature as part of the DJI WooKong-M flight control. If there is a
lost link, the WooKong-M will be programmed to rise 65.6 feet (20 meters) instantaneously (not
to exceed a maximum altitude of 200 AGL), travel horizontally to the home area, and land. For
more information regarding the emergency fail safe methods, please refer to the WooKong-M
User Manual (Exhibit 1) to this petition. The failsafe section begins on page 17 of that document.

         Flights will be terminated at 20% of battery life. Currently, the Helios 960's battery is
limited to approximately 10 minutes of flight time. Helios will use an iPad to monitor telemetry
data, including battery life. The iPad will send an audio signal when the battery depletes to 20%
of remaining power.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 11-12, 17-25, and 32-35 in Section V below. Each has been accepted or imposed by the
FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

IV. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at
least equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory
structure. Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to
be bound when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A
contains a matrix connecting: (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for
which it provides an equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333
exemption grants in which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety. Appendix B
requests relief from additional FARs that are not identified in Appendix A.

      Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national
security issue. The PIC is willing to undergo a background check, including the proposed
Transportation Security Administration Vetting process, to ensure that no national security threat
is present. Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg. 9543 at 9572

V. Proposed Conditions of the Exemption

1. The UA will weigh approximately 18 lbs. (8 kg.), inclusive of battery and technical payload.

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of scripted closed-set filming for the motion picture and television industries and
    construction site inspections in Class G airspace nationwide.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and visual observer.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 200 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in
    feet AGL.

5. The UA will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 35 knots.

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the UA pilot in command (PIC), a
    visual observer (VO), and a camera operator (CO).

7. The PIC will have, at minimum, 40 hours of training on the UA to be operated under this
    grant before accepting commercial operations.

8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification
    criteria and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with
    how the UA will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency
    maneuvers and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and
    structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent
    with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). A record of the PIC training will be documented and made available
    upon request by the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during
    dedicated training sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all
    persons not essential for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC
    will operate the UA with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14
    CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
                                                          9
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance
    has been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance
    and alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements,
    at the direction and under the supervision of the UA manufacturer. Maintenance, inspection,
    alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts will be noted in the aircraft
    records, including total time in service, description of work accomplished, and the signature
    of the manufacturer, authorizing the return of the UA to service. The manufacturer will make
    an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken against discrepancies discovered
    between inspections.

15. When conducting operations for the motion picture and television industry, petitioner will
    submit a written Plan of Activities, and any additional necessary paperwork, to the FSDO at
    least one day before the proposed operations begin.

16. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will
    not be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight
    operations.

17. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions)
    there is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and land
    the UA with 20% battery power remaining.

18. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 20% battery
    reserve.

19. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

20. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communication with the ground station or
    loses its GPS signal, it will return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating
    area and land or be recovered in accordance with the operating documents

21. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

22. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
                                                         10
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow
    the procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating
    documents, it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request.
    If the petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the
    FAA granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant
    of exemption.

23. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents
    of the landowners over which flights will be conducted.

24. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or
    city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

25. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

26. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, altitude level
    and potential transponder requirements.

27. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a
    NOTAM as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport
    management will be made available to the Administrator upon request.

28. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally
    from, a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

29. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

30. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

31. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

32. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
                                                         11
    activities at all times.

33. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

34. The UA will not be operated over congested or densely populated areas.

35. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

    a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from
         the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
         nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
         nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
         will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

    b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
         such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
         present an undue hazard.

    c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
         undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

36. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the
    National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web
    site: www.ntsb.gov.

VI. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur (i) over public spaces, where there is no expectation of privacy, and around
participating individuals or (ii) over private, restricted property where applicant has permission
from the landowner/authorized agent to film. When the UA is being flown, the onboard cameras
will be focused on the film or inspection area, not on nonparticipating individuals who may be
present during filming.

VII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety in both the television and movie
industry, and the construction industry. The enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact
achieved using a UA with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no
passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying
crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UA operation
enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
                                                         12
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of applicant's UA for filming
the television and movie industry and the construction industry, pursuant to petitioner's rules of
operation.

A. Motion Picture and Television Industry Filming

         As the FAA has repeatedly recognized in granting other exemptions under Section 333,
the use of a UA to take videos and photography over closed, scripted, motion picture and
television sets significantly increases the level of safety for both the actors and crew. Currently,
filmmakers use manned aircraft, which can weigh 6,000 lbs. or more. Manned aircraft also, by
definition, carry a pilot and other crew. They carry flammable fluids, and require large areas to
take off, operate over, and land.

         By using the Helios 960, many of these dangerous conditions will be alleviated. The
Helios 960 weighs under 15 lbs. The pilot and flight crew will be safely on the ground rather
than several hundred feet in the air. The UA is powered by a battery, and requires a small area to
operate in. The FAA has previously determined that using a UA such as the Helios 960 will
provide a greater level of safety when filming for the motion picture and television industry.
Exemption No. 11062.

B. Construction Inspections

         Use of a UA to conduct inspections of construction projects will provide a greater level
of safety than what is currently available. The construction industry has traditionally been very
dangerous for workers, both based on the working conditions and equipment used, including
helicopters and cranes. Currently, aerial inspections are not done on many construction projects.
Instead, inspections are conducted from the ground, or from within the structure being
constructed, giving a limited view of the project. This limits the capabilities of architects and
construction crews examining the work that has been done, and could lead to misidentification or
failure to identify flaws in the construction. Those projects that do incorporate aerial inspections
must rely upon manned helicopters or other types of aircraft, devices that can pose a great risk to
those piloting and those on the ground below, without providing the most accurate results.

         Alternatively, using the Helios 960 to videotape and photograph construction sites will
allow the construction crew to gain a better vantage point of the structure. Safety concerns can be
better identified and fixed, and the inspectors will be able to gain a more thorough understanding
of construction progress. This UA will be able to provide a quick and cost effective aerial
inspection of an entire jobsite, something that is much more difficult to perform without this
technology. The device can be used to check the progress of the project and provide visual
information on hard-to-reach areas that may not be adequately inspected otherwise without
putting people in danger. UAs can be equipped with specialized cameras and sensors that
provide enhanced detection of other concerns, such as gas leaks, lack of structural integrity. The
FAA has previously determined that using a UA such as the Helios 960 will provide an
equivalent or greater level of safety than manned flight when inspecting construction sites.
Exemption Nos. 11109 and 11204.

B. Appendix B: Helios's argument for exemption from 14 C.F.R. §61.113: Private pilot
         privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.

         Helios requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §61.113 so that the PIC of the UA will not
be required to possess a private or commercial pilot's license. As the FAA and numerous other
national airspace regulators have recognized, UA operations conducted by persons who do not
hold a pilot's license can still achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by
manned aircraft with pilots holding a private or commercial pilot's license.

         Although it recognizes that a pilot's license is unnecessary for safe UA operation, the
FAA has to date declined to allow grant exemptions under Section 333 that would permit
individuals who possess neither a private nor a commercial pilot's certificate to conduct
commercial UA operations. It has specified two reasons for declining to do so. First, it has stated
that it does not possess the authority under Section 333 to exempt individuals from the
requirement under 49 U.S.C. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman to
serve in the capacity for which the certificate was issued. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. Second,
the FAA has concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) security screening
required of all certified airmen meets the statutory requirement in Section 333 that operations not
pose a threat to national security. Exemption No. 11110 at 15.

         Helios respectfully requests that the FAA reconsider its position. There is no dispute that
it is unnecessary for an operator of a UA to go through the rigorous process of becoming a
certified pilot in order to safely operate a UA. In addition, the FAA does have the authority to
exempt UA operators from the requirement in 49 U.S.C. §44711to hold an airman certificate for
"serv[ing] in the capacity for which the certificate was issued." Indeed, it has exercised that
authority repeatedly in the Section 333 process. Finally, the FAA's security concerns can be
addressed by a variety of methods involving operator background checks to be conducted by

         1. The FAA and foreign regulators recognize that obtaining a manned aircraft
             pilot license is unnecessary for safe operation of a UA

         The FAA, like the other national airspace regulators that have considered the issue, has
concluded that UA operations conducted by persons who do not hold a pilot's license can still
achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned aircraft with pilots
holding a private or commercial pilot's license. In its recent UAS NPRM, the FAA stated:

         "While these airman certification requirements are necessary for manned aircraft
         operations, they impose an unnecessary burden for many small UAS operations.
         This is because a person typically obtains a private or commercial pilot certificate
         by learning how to operate a manned aircraft. Much of that knowledge would not
         be applicable to small UAS operations because a small UAS is operated
         differently than manned aircraft. In addition, the knowledge currently necessary to
         obtain a private or commercial pilot certificate would not equip the certificate
         holder with the tools necessary to safely operate a small UAS... Thus, requiring
         persons wishing to operate a small UAS to obtain a private or commercial pilot
         certificate imposes the cost of certification on those persons, but does not result in
         a significant safety benefit because the process of obtaining the certificate does

         not equip those persons with the tools necessary to mitigate the public risk posed
         by small UAS operations." Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned
         Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg. 9543 at 9550 (proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14
         C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45, et al.)).

         The FAA's conclusion that manned aircraft flying experience is unnecessary for the
operation of a UA is supported by research by the FAA and the Army Research Laboratory.
They demonstrate that UAs, even those much larger than the sUAS proposed by Helios, can be
safely flown by non-certificated pilots with a small amount of training. For example, one Army
Research Laboratory study concluded:

         "[T]he specific motor skills needed to control the radio-controlled UAV would
         have to be learned by aviators independently of the motor skills learned in flying
         an aircraft. In particular, the somatic and visual cues that pilots use during aircraft
         landings would not be useful (and perhaps even counter-productive) for the
         different skill sets and perceptual viewpoint necessary for radio-controlled
         landings."1

Additional research reports lend further support for the exclusion requested. For example, a
report sponsored by the FAA concluded that "We know that certain systems, like the U.S. Army
Hunter and Shadow systems, are successfully flown by pilots with no manned aircraft
experience."2

         In addition, foreign government airspace regulators that have examined the issue have
consistently recognized that the skills required to fly a manned aircraft are irrelevant to operating
a UA. For that reason, they have concluded that UA operators do not need to have a private or
commercial pilot's license. Canada, for example, does not require a pilot's license to operate a
UA. Transport Canada requires training of UA operators, but that training is limited to pilot
ground school and flight operation training on UAs, not manned aircraft.3 Moreover, Canada
allows this training to be "provided by other pilots, manufacturers, [UA] flight training

populated areas may change this assessment, indicating further research was needed to address
this concern, this concern is inapplicable as Helios's flights will not be in congested areas. See

organizations or . . . self taught." 4

         Similarly, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recognized that
determining "Remote Pilot qualification requirements on the same basis as manned aircraft may
yield requirements that are too inflexible, too onerous and inappropriate for UAS operations."5
As a result, the CAA only requires UA operators to demonstrate UA operator competence.6
While there are a variety of ways to demonstrate competence, the most common is to complete a
course that will lead to a ground exam and flight test. Australia, too, requires only passage of a
UA-specific ground school program in lieu of a private pilot license.7 Finally, more than a dozen
countries, including Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, have adopted the
National UAS Certificate for Small Unmanned Aircraft (BNUC-S) Standard for UA pilot
certification.8 This standard results in a type-specific UA certificate and does not require the
operator to have a pilot's license. The process involves taking a short ground school course,
passing a ground school test and then passing a practical test on commercial operation of the
specific UAS per the UAS manufacturer's operations manual.

         All of this experience and evidence indicates that the proposed exemption will provide a
greater level of safety than operations under 14 C.F.R. §61.113. In this instance, the PIC has had
decades of UA experience. He has focused his training and education on UAs generally, and in
particular on the aircraft to be operated, rather than taking additional time and risk to train on a
manned aircraft, weighing several thousand pounds and carrying highly flammable fuel.

         The FAA has concluded in the NPRM that such UA-specific training is more than
sufficient to provide an equivalent level of safety for UA operations. Sometime in the next 18-
24 months, that position will be enshrined in a valid regulation. However, in the meantime, the
FAA claims it lacks the authority to relax the requirement to possess a pilot certificate. As we
show in the next section, that position is both incorrect and contradicted by the FAA's recent
decisions.

         2. The FAA has and has already exercised the authority to exempt applicants from
             the airman certificate requirement

         The FAA claims that it lacks authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement of
49 U.S. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This claim is
inconsistent with both (i) the statutory language of that section and Section 333, and (ii)

numerous recent FAA decisions.

         The operative part of 49 USC §44711 provides that a "person may not . . . serve in any
capacity as an airman with respect to a civil aircraft, . . . used, or intended for use, in air
commerce -- (A) without an airman certificate authorizing the airman to serve in the capacity
for which the certificate was issued . . . " If the FAA's interpretation were correct, this language
would require that any person wishing to operate a UA for commercial operations have an
airman certificate authorizing the person to serve as an airman in commercial operations.

         However, in all of its recent grants of Section 333 petitions, the FAA has ­ without
explicitly acknowledging the fact - exempted commercial UA operators from the § 44711(A)
requirement that they hold an airman certificate authorizing them "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." It has done so by allowing them to operate a UA so long as
they hold a private pilot's or sport pilot's authorization, even though such a certificate does not
permit commercial operations. Exemption No. 11062 at 15-18; Exemption No. 11110 at 14-16;
Exemption No. 11191 at 3-5; and Exemption No. 11229 at 3 and 8.

         The FAA argues that it cannot exempt applicants from the requirements of §44711
because, while the specific language of Section 333 grants it limited statutory flexibility relative
to 49 U.S.C. §44704 for the purposes of airworthiness certification, Section 333 does not provide
flexibility relative to §44711 and other sections of Title 49. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This
argument ignores the plain language of the statute. The relevant language of Section 333 is:

         (a) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subtitle, and
         not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
         Transportation shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate
         safely in the national airspace system before completion of the plan and
         rulemaking required by section 332 of this Act or the guidance required by
         section 334 of this Act.

         (b) ASSESSMENT OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.--In making the
         determination under subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine, at a
         minimum--

         (1) which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size,
         weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas,
         and operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the
         national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security; and

         (2) whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
         certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for
         the operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1).

         (c) REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE OPERATION.--If the Secretary determines
         under this section that certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in
         the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the
         safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system.

                                                         20
         The language of Section 333(b) is permissive: it requires that the Secretary "determine, at
a minimum . . . whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the operation of
unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1)." Nothing in (b) precludes the
Secretary from determining whether or not a pilot's license is required for operation of a UA
identified under paragraph (b)(1).

         Indeed, the FAA has implicitly conceded the point by granting exemptions from the
requirement that commercial UA operators hold a commercial pilot certificate. From an
analytical standpoint, there is no difference between granting an exemption from the commercial
pilot's license requirement and granting an exemption from the private or sport pilot's license
requirement. Both are clearly exemptions from a specific statutory requirement in 49 U.S.C.
§44711. If the FAA has the statutory authority under Section 333(b) to do the former, it has the
same authority to do the latter.9

         For all of the reasons set forth above, the FAA should reconsider its position and exercise
its full authority to grant an exemption from all the requirements of 49 USC §44711, so that a
person serving as a commercial UA operator need not have a pilot's license.

9 The FAA has not specifically identified the statutory provision that underpins its authority to
grant the exemptions from the commercial pilot's license requirement. Whether the statutory
basis is Section 333 or some other provision makes no difference. If there is a basis for a partial
exemption from in 49 U.S.C. § 44711, that basis also justifies an exemption from the entire
provision.

RTH Switch From Transmitter

In addition to the function of failsafe RTH, WooKong-M now has a new function of
RTH switch from transmitter. It is unnecessary to turn into failsafe mode.

Support IOSD MARK II

The WooKong-M now support iOSD MARK II. This will undoubtedly give you a
fantastic flight performance. Depending upon DJI's accumulation of historic and reliable
information integration technology, the iOSD MARK II can grab the most accurate first-
hand flight data information in the shortest possible time.

Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC)

Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By
using Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC), wherever the nose points, the forward
direction has nothing to do with nose direction:
In course lock flying, the forward direction is the same as a recorded nose direction. See
the following figures (Mode 2) 
In home lock flying, the forward direction is the same
as the direction from home point to multi-rotor.See the following figures (Mode 2)

Enhanced Fail-Safe And Auto Go Home/Landing

Enhanced fail-safe is the feature to ensure that the multi-rotor will hover automatically if
it loses RC signal. After losing the signal in a certain time period, WKM will calculate
the safest way to return the helicopter to the home position. The helicopter will hover
over your GPS start point and land automatically. This feature will guarantee the safety
of your expensive payloads and equipments on the platform.

Introduction

DJI iOSD is specially designed for DJI autopilot system during the FPV flight or other aero-modeling activates. DJI iOSD
can transmit video and iOSD information in real time, which will help you to obtain the aircraft status information during a
FPV flight. It can display power voltage, flight velocity, height, distance from the home point, horizontal attitude, GPS
satellite number, etc. iOSD and video information are superposed on the receiver, making iOSD data clearly visible and
bringing you a more involved flight experience.

DJI iOSD should be used in conjunction with a DJI autopilot system. It supports two video input sources under PAL or
NTSC mode, which can be selected remotely by an R/C transmitter switch. The R/C TX switch can also change the
wireless video transmitter channel remotely when user uses the wireless video transmitter specified by DJI. The iOSD
supports online upgrades. The iOSD has built-in BEC, which is on one hand for the power supply of the camera, on the
other hand for the power supply of the autopilot  system's  main controller to improve the power supply reliability of the
main controller.

  receives data from the main controller, superimposes the data
  with the video image, and then transmits the whole information
  via a transmitter.

 CAN-Bus Cable ×2

  Connect the iOSD to your autopilot system through a CAN-Bus
  cable.

 Video Input Cable ×1

  Connect the iOSD with video input source (i.e. camera or DJI
  Z15) for video input and power supply, with maximum current
  of 1A. If you connect the iOSD to DJI Z15, please use the 4Pin-
  Audio Head cable.
  If connect to other camera, use the 4Pin cable for the
  connection in accordance with the wiring diagram.

 Video Output Cable ×2

  Only when you use the wireless video transmitter module
  specified by DJI, you can use the bi-port cable to connect the
  iOSD with the video transmitter module. Otherwise, you can
  use the one-port cable for your own connection in accordance
  with the wiring diagram.

 2-PIN to 3-PIN Cable ×1

  Connect the iOSD with the R/C receiver through this cable.
  When there are two video signal inputs, it is used for the
  selection of video signal sources. It can be used for the
  selection of AVL58 video channel.

    If you use wireless video transmission module AVL58 specified by DJI, connect through the bi-port cable.

   If you use your own module, please connect through the one-port cable according the pin description.

Channel Control pinControl signal for the video transmitter channel number (CH1.....CH8).If your video
transmitter does not support this feature, then ignore this pin.

Video and OSD output pin: make sure this is correctly connected.
Positive/Negative voltage of battery pin: its output voltage is equate to the voltage of the battery, supplying
power for your wireless video transmitter. It is recommended to solder the two cables of the same function.

         Please make sure the input voltage of your own wireless video transmitter is matched to the voltage of

 BATT, to prevent damage from your wireless video transmitter module. For example, if the Battery is
        6S(25V) and the input voltage of the wireless video transmitter is 3S(12V), then you cannot use the
        BATT+ to supply power since the 25V is larger than 12V.

Important: iOSD can be connected to any CAN-Bus port of the WKM system, BUT should be connected to the NAZA-M or NAZA-M
V2 via the PMU V2 (NAZA-M V2 Accessory). NAZA-M should be upgraded to the firmware version of V3.10 or above when using
with the PMU V2 , with the same assistant software V2.10 of NAZA-M V2. iOSD should not be connected to the WKM and NAZA-
M/NAZA-M V2 at the same time. Refer to the Appendix for more connection details.

                                                 Video Input Port

If you use the DJI Z15, it is recommended to use the 4Pin- Audio Head cable for connecting the iOSD and GCU.
If you use the 4Pin cable, please connect the iOSD to the Z15's GCU according to the above chart.

If you use your own camera(s), please connect through the Video Input Cable according the pin description.

AV1/AV2 pinyou can select the required input. AV1 is default. POWER pin supply power for Video input
source such as a camera, with the maximum current of 1A. If the battery is 3S LiPo then: Output Voltage = Input
Votage. If 4S~6S then: Output Voltage=11.2V. Make sure your camera is rated for this voltage and
current(1A), if not, please use a separate battery supply.

If you use other wireless video transmitter and the rated voltage is over the voltage of BATT+, you can use the
POWER pin to apply power. Make sure the total current consumption of wireless video transmitter and camera
is lower than 1A, otherwise will damage your iOSD.

                                     For example, when the icon on your display screen is located in the
                                     Orientation-3 as shown in the following figure, you can change the
                                     aircraft nose direction through operating your R/C TX. When the icon
                                     arrives at the Orientation-1, your aircraft nose is heading the home
                                     point, which can help you pull your aircraft back to the home point

Notes

(1) You can configure the Flight control system using the Assistant software on a PC or iOS mobile Device
        wirelessly over the link of the 2.4G Bluetooth Datalink, however you cannot upgrade the firmware of
        the Flight control system using this communication route.

(2) When connecting a BTU module or a LED Bluetooth unit to the Flight control system to configure in
        the Assistant on mobile devices, as well as connecting a BTU module to the Ground end to use the iPad
        Ground station, the two Bluetooth communication links will not interfere with each other.

(3) If the Air end is changed to connect to a new Main controller, you should power cycle the Ground end.
(4) Make sure the LED indicator of BTU module is green after power on, for specific usage details please

        refer to the BTU Manual.
(5) For usage of the PC Ground Station please refer to the latest Ground Station User Manual.

Important :
(1) If there are obstacles between the ground and air ends then the radio signal of the 2.4G Bluetooth

        Datalink will be weak; please make sure the antennas are always visibly unobstructed during the flight.
        Human body, trees, buildings or hills will disconnect the link between the Air end and the Ground end.
(2) Make sure the antenna of the Air end is pointing down, and the antenna of the Ground end is pointing
        upwards; it's better to put the Ground end at a high place to get further transmission distance.
(3) When using the ACE ONE Flight control system with the 2.4G Bluetooth Datalink, the Ground Station
        will connect to the Main controller 15s after power on.

      pointing direction) properties to build a new waypoint during flight. This function is always available when the

      UAV is hovering or flying.

1.4 Flight Limit of Special Areas

All UAV operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO (International Civil Aviation
Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, key areas have been restricted, such as:
a) Within the radius of 15Km from Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China.
b) Within the radius of 8Km from the airport.

Users will not be able to build waypoints or Home points in designated special areas and the waypoint routines go

through these special areas are invalid, and the UAV will fail to cruise to those areas.
All the special areas have been restricted are specified on the DJI official website and please refer to Special Areas
List (http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-gs) to obtain details.

Connection to PC

To connect board to your PC, you need a miniUSB cable. First time a USB cable is plugged, you need
to install the appropriate software driver. If your PC does not install the driver automatically, install one
manually from this link: http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx.
After you install the driver and connecting the board, a new virtual COM port will be created. You need
to choose this COM port in the SimleBGC software (GUI) to initiate the connection.

It is safe to connect USB and main power (battery) simultaneously. But be very careful to not reverse
the polarity of the main battery, because in this case it will burn out controller and may damage your
PC!

There is also a possibility to use Bluetooh­To-Serial adapter (HC-05, HC-06, Sparkfun BlueSMiRF, and
comparable) to connect to the GUI and tune the board remotely. There is a special connector on the
board that matches the same one on the BT module. It is marked as UART and contains pins: 5V,
GND, RX, TX. You can solder BT module over it or use extender Male-Male 4pin cable.

          IMPORTANT NOTE: Bluetooth module must be configured at 115200 baud rate and Even
          parity (generally its not set by default!). Refer your module's user manual to find out how to
          configure bluetooth. With these settings, you will be able connect to the GUI and even to
          upgrade firmware remotely.

Running application

Follow these steps to connect your main controller board to the GUI software:

           Connect the mini-USB cable

           Start the GUI, select correct COM-port from the list, and click "Connect".
               After the connection is established, all board settings and profiles will be loaded into the
               GUI. You can re-load the current board parameters anytime by clicking the "READ" button.

           After adjusting parameters in the GUI you should write them to the controller board by
               clicking the "WRITE" button. Only the current profile parameters will be saved to the board.
               To return to the default settings push the "RESET TO DEFAULTS" button.

           To choose a different profile (with different settings) select it from the list of profiles (located
               in the upper right corner of the GUI window). You can store different settings as three
               different profiles onto the controller board. You can switch profiles saved on the board by
               choosing the profile in the GUI or by pressing the MENU button on the controller board.

Remember that some settings are common for all profiles and can not be saved on a per-profile basis.
Parameters such as sensor orientation, hardware configuration, RC inputs, and motors outs are the
same across all profiles.

The GUI starts in the English version of the user interface. To change the interface language, choose
one in the 'language' menu and restart the program.

GUI Blocks

The GUI contains different functional blocks:

     1. Configuration block in the central part of the window, organized by `tab':

           Basic ­ Basic gimbal stabilization settings. Adjusting these settings is usually adequate to
               achieve good camera stabilization.

           Advanced -- More precise tuning options.

           RC Settings ­ settings to control the gimbal roll/pitch/yaw orientation with RC inputs.

           Service ­ Specify the behavior of the MENU button (located on the controller board or
               mounted externally) and tune the battery monitoring service.

           Follow Mode ­ settings related to special mode of the camera control.

           Real-time Data -- real-time sensor data monitoring. This screen is extremely helpful in
               tuning your gimbal performance. Firmware Update -- Firmware and GUI software versions
               and update options.

           Firmware Upgrade ­ lets you to check the fresh version of firmware and upgrade if
               necessary.

     2. Connection -- COM-port selection and connection status.

     3. Profile -- Profile selection, loading, re-naming, and saving.

     4. Control Panel -- graphic visualization of gimbal orientation angles in three axes.

           Black arrows are displaying the angles, blue arrows are a 10x time magnification to provide
               higher precision. Red marks show target angles that gimbal should keep.

           Thin blue lines shows the maximum (peak) deflection from the central, neutral point.

                                 60
      Blue digits show peak deflection amplitude. Using these numbers, stabilization quality can
          be estimated.

      Vertical red bars to the right of the scales show actual power level, from 0 to 100%.

5. READ, WRITE, RESET TO DEFAULTS buttons are used to transfer setting from/to board.
6. MOTORS ON/OFF button is used to toggle motors state.
7. At the bottom of the screen, tips, status or error messages (in red color) are displayed . Overall

     cycle time and I2C error count is also displayed.
8. Battery voltage indicator with warning sector.

Basic Settings

Note: Before tuning your controller, install the camera into the gimbal firmly and ensure your gimbal's
center of gravity is leveled as much as possible.

 P,I,D ­ PID regulation parameters for all axes. .

 P ­ describes the power of disturbance response. Higher values means a stronger
     response reaction to external disturbance. Raise this value until the stabilization quality of
     fast disturbances will be adequate. If the "P" value is too high, oscillations of the axis will
     start to be present. These oscillations will get worse if there are vibrations that reach the
     IMU sensor board. If oscillations occur, raise the "D" parameter by 1 or 2 units, and then try
     to raise the "P" value again.

 D ­ The "D" value reduces the reaction speed. This value helps to remove low-frequency
     oscillations. A "D" value that is too high can cause high-frequency oscillations, particularly,
     when the IMU sensor is exposed to vibrations.

 I ­ The "I" value changes the speed at which the gimbal moves to incoming RC commands
     and to move the gimbal back to neutral. Low values result in a slow and smooth reaction to
     RC commands and to getting back to neutral. Increase this value to speed up the
     movement

 Limit Accelerations - this option lets to limit angular accelerations in case of hard RC or Serial
     control (useful to prevents jerks or skipped steps, smoother camera control, less impact on the
     multirotor's frame). The less is value, the smoother is camera rotation under control.

 POWER ­ maximum voltage supplied to the motors (0 - 255, where 255 means full battery
     voltage). Choose this parameter according to your motor characteristics. Basic tuning:

 Motors should not get too hot! Motor temperatures of over 80 will cause permanent
     damage to motor magnets.

 A Power value that is too low will not provide enough force for the motor to move the gimbal
     and stabilize the camera adequately. A low power value will be most noticeable in windy
     conditions, when the gimbal is not well balanced, or if the gimbal suffers from mechanical
     friction. Slowly lower the Power parameter to find its optimal value. Find the lowest value
     that still provides good stabilization and adequate holding torque.

 Raising the power equals raising the "P" value of PID settings. If you raise the POWER
     value, you should re-tune your PID values as well.

 "+" - Additional power that will be add to the main power in case of big error (caused by
     missed steps). It helps to return camera to the normal position. If main power + additional power
     is greater than 255, the result is limited to 255.

 INVERT ­ reverse motor rotation direction. It's extremely important to choose the correct motor
     rotation direction to not damage your gimbal. To determine the correct direction, set the P, I, and

D values to 0 and the POWER values to 80 (or higher if your motors don't produce enough

force to hold/move the camera). Level the camera tray horizontally and click the AUTO button in

the "Motor configuration" settings. The gimbal will make small movement to determine correct

© 2013-2014 Basecamelectronics®                                                     4

                                 61
     motor rotation direction. Wait for the calibration procedure to complete. Then, re-set your PIDPITCH
     values and tune your Power values.

 NUM.POLES ­ Number of motor poles. This value needs to be equal to the number of magnets
     in your motor's bell. During the "auto" calibration process described above, this value is
     automatically detected. However, this value is sometimes not correctly determined during the
     "auto" calibration process and will need to be verified and possibly corrected manually. Most
     brushless gimbal motors are built with 14 poles (or magnets) and utilize a DLRK winding
     scheme. Count your motor magnets and enter this value if the value is not correct in the GUI.

 External FC Gain ­ Gain value for matching the gimbal data from your flight controller
     (optional). For better stabilization and utilization of some additional features, the knowledge
     about the frame inclination angles is required. SimpleBGC IMU doesn't provide such
     information. Most of FC have servo outs for connecting gimbals. This outs should be connected
     to SimpleBGC controller through EXT_ROLL and EXT_PITCH inputs.

      Activate gimbal outs in FC and set range limits for angles you generally fly (for example ,+-
          30 degrees of frame inclination should equals full servo range about 1000-2000).

      Deactivate all filters and smoothing of FC gimbal settings (if present).

      In the RC-settings tab, make sure that inputs EXT_ROLL, EXT_PITCH doesn't used to
          control gimbal. (i.e. are not chosen as source for any other RC control task).

      In REALTIME DATA tab, check availability of EXT_FC_ROLL, EXT_FC_PITCH signals, and
          make sure they are split to axes correctly. (Frame roll angle tilting should cause
          EXT_FC_ROLL change in approximately 900..2100 range. The same is for pitch.)

      Connect power supply, and setup stabilization as described above (tune POWER, INVERT,
          PID)

      Push AUTO button in FLIGHT CONTROL GAIN group, and smoothly incline copter frame
          to different directions by all axes for 10-30 seconds.

      Push AUTO button again to complete calibration. (Calibration will stop automatically after
          some time too). New gains will be written into EEPROM and shown in the GUI.

          NOTE : You may skip this step and leave zero values at initial setup.

 Sensor -- Specify your IMU sensor board's orientation and position on the gimbal . For a
     standard IMU sensor installation, look at the gimbal from behind just like the camera will view
     out from the gimbal. Viewing the gimbal in this way, the UP and Right direction will match the Z
     and X axis. You can place the IMU sensor in any direction, keeping its sides always parallel to
     the motor axis (be very accurate here, it is a very important to precisely align the sensor and
     mount it firmly). Configure your IMU orientation in the GUI. The correct configuration should
     result in the following:

           Camera pitches forward ­ the PITCH arrow spins clockwise in the GUI.

           Camera rolls right - ROLL arrow spins clockwise in the GUI.

           Camera yaws clockwise - YAW arrow spins clockwise.

           Skip Gyro calibration at startup - With this option, the board starts working immediately
               after powering it on, using the saved calibration data from last gyroscope calibration call.
               However, stored calibration data may become inaccurate over time or during temperature
               changes. We recommend you to re-calibrate your gyro from time to time to ensure the best
               performance.

Second IMU sensor

There is an option to install the second IMU sensor on the gimbal's frame. The advantage is more
precise stabilization (you may use lower PID's to get the same quality) and knowing of frame tilting, that
greatly helps for 3-axis system to extend the range of working angles.

Second IMU should be connected to the same I2C bus as main (in parallel). Sensors should have
different I2C-address (Main IMU ­ 0x68, Frame IMU ­ 0x69). On the Basecam IMU, address 0x69 may
be set by cutting the ADDR bridge, located on the back side of the sensor:

Mounting the Frame IMU

There are two options where to place the second IMU: below YAW motor and above it. In case of 2-
axis stabilization, there is only one option ­ above ROLL motor.

Frame IMU:                                    YAW
above YAW                                   MOTOR

below YAW
(above ROLL)

                                      ROLL   PITCH
                                     MOTOR  MOTOR

Camera IMU

If the sensor is placed above YAW motor, it helps to stabilize ROLL, PITCH and YAW motors. But the
system becomes less stable during long work (because the frame heading, estimated from the second
IMU, may drift with time and auto-correction may not work in all cases).

If the sensor is placed below YAW motor, it does not help YAW axis stabilization, but works more
reliable.

Like the main (camera) IMU, the frame IMU may be mounted in any orientation, keeping its axis parallel
with motor's axis.

Configuring the frame IMU

To configure the frame IMU, first of all set its location in the "Advanced" tab, "Sensor" area. Write
settings to the board and go to the "Basic" tab. Press the button "Frame IMU":

If the second IMU is connected properly, this button becomes active. It means that all IMU settings now
affect on the frame IMU. Change sensor orientation (axis TOP, RIGHT) and write setting to the board, if
necessary (board will be restarted). After restart, calibrate the accelerometer and gyroscope like you did
it for the main IMU. For the accelerometer, you can do simple calibration or extended 6-point
calibration.

You may notice that right panels with arrows are displaying now angles not for the main, but for the
frame IMU. Also, in the "Realtime Data" tab, accelerometer's and gyroscope's data go for the frame
IMU. It helps to properly configure an orientation of the sensor and check its calibration.

RC Settings tab

 RC Input Mapping ­ here you can assign hardware RC inputs to virtual control channels.
     There are 4 hardware inputs provided on the board for RC Radio control connections, which
     you can assign to control any of three channels, one for each axes, and one command channel.
     If control for an axis is not needed, leave the option at "no input".

 RC_ROLL pin mode ­ allows to configure several formats of incoming signal for RC_ROLL pin:

 Normal ­ incoming signal is in the PWM format, that most RC-receivers generally outputs

 Sum-PPM - some receivers may have this signal output. It is a PWM format modification, in
     which every channel transmits sequentially through one cable. In this case you do not need
     to connect other channels (read your receiver's user manual to check if it has SumPPM
     out).

 Futaba s-bus ­ receivers made by Futaba may transmit data in special digital format, up to
     16 channels by one wire. Connect it to RC_ROLL pin.

 Spektrum ­ another digital multi-channel protocol, that is used to communicate Spektrum's
     satellite modules with the main module, and in its clones. Because there are many
     modifications of this protocol, it may not work as expected in the first versions of
     SimpleBGC firmware (but we will work on correct implementation in next versions). There is
     a dedicated socket on the board (marked Spektrum) that matches standard connector. You
     should bind satellite module with the transmitter manually.

 For each control targets you can choose appropriate hardware input from the drop-down list.

 RC_ROLL, RC_PITCH, RC_YAW, FC_ROLL, FC_PITCH ­ hardware inputs on board that
     accept signal in the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) format (excepting RC_ROLL, see
     above). Most RC receivers output this signal type.

 ADC1, ADC2, ADC3 -- dedicated analog inputs, marked on the board as A1, A2, A3 and
     accepts analog signal in range from 0 to +3.3 volts. For example, joystick variable resistor
     provides such signal. Connect A1..A3 to the center contact of variable resistor, +3.3V and
     GND to side contacts. See Connection Diagram for more info.

 VIRT_CH_XX ­ In case of RC_ROLL pin mode is set to multi-channel signal format, you
     can chose one of the virtual channels.

      Control targets:                                                                                 7

                                 64
      ROLL, PITCH, YAW - controls the position of the camera

      CMD allows to execute some actions. You can configure 2- or 3-position switch on your RC
          for specified channel, and assign it to CMD channel. Its range is splitted into 3 sections :
          LOW ,MID ,HIGH. When changing the position of your RC-switch, signal jumps from one
          section to another, and assigned command is executed. The full list of available commands
          is described in the section "MENU BUTTON" of this manual.

      FC_ROLL, FC_PITCH ­ is used to mark any of PWM inputs to be a signal from the external
          flight controller. See "External FC gain" section for details.

 RC Mix - you can mix 2 inputs together before applying to any of ROLL, PITCH or YAW axis. It
     lets to control the camera from the 2 sources (joystick and RC for example). You can adjust the
     proportion of the mix from 0 to 100%.

 ANGLE MODE -- RC stick will control the camera angle directly. The full RC range will cause a
     camera to go from min to max angles, as specified above. If RC stick doesn't move, camera
     stands still. The speed of rotation depends on the "SPEED" setting and the acceleration limiter
     setting.

 SPEED MODE -- RC stick will control the rotation speed. If stick is centered - camera stands
     still, if stick is deflected, camera starts to rotate, but does not exceed min-max range. Speed is
     slightly decreased near min-max borders. Speed of rotation is proportional to stick angle and
     the SPEED setting. RC control inversion is allowed in both of control modes.

 MIN.ANGLE, MAX.ANGLE ­ range of the angles controlled from RC or in Follow mode. To
     inverse the control, set higher value first, and lower value second. For example, if you want to
     configure a camera to go from leveled position to down position, set 0-90 (or 90-0 to inverse).

 LPF ­ Control signal filtering. The higher is value, the smoother is reaction to the stick
     commands. This filter cuts fast stick movements, but adds some delay.

Follow Mode

There is a special control mode, when the camera "follows" for a tilting of the outer frame, but
eliminates small frame jerking. Several modes of operation are possible:

· Disabled ­ camera is locked to ground and may be rotated only from RC.

 Estimate frame angles from motors - it use magnetic field for rough estimation of frame
     tilting. Helps to increase the range of the frame angles where the gimbal's operation is
     stable. To proper operation in this mode, it is strictly required to calibrate Offset setting (see
     below). Like with the Follow mode, its not recommended to use this option in flight, its
     dedicated for hand-held systems only.
     NOTE that this option is ignored if you connect second IMU mounted on the frame, because
     the data from the second IMU is more precise than from motors.)

· Follow Flight Controller ­ camera is controlled from RC together with the mixed signal from
     an external flight controller (FC). Almost every FC has servo outputs to drive a gimbal. It feeds
     the information about the frame angles to this outputs, in the PWM format that all servos
     understand. SimpleBGC can get this information and use it to control a camera. It is necessary
     to connect and calibrate external flight controller (see EXT.FC GAIN settings). After calibration
     you can setup the percentage values for ROLL and PITCH axis, so the camera will follow frame
     inclinations.

· Follow PITCH, ROLL ­ this mode is dedicated to                                    ROLL axis mode
     hand-held systems. FC connection is not required.
     In this mode, the position of the outer frame by                               locked to the
     PITCH and ROLL is estimated from the motor's                                   ground
     magnetic field. This means that if motor skips steps,                          soft transition
     position will be estimated incorrectly and operator
     should correct camera by hands, returning it to          angle of the camera   follow frame
     proper position. You should use this mode carefully      inclination by PITCH
     for FPV flying, because if the camera misses its
     initial direction, there is no chance to return it back
     automatically.

© 2013-2014 Basecamelectronics®                                                                   8

                                 65
           Follow ROLL start, deg. - Set the angle (in degrees) of the camera PITCH-ing up or down,
               where the ROLL axis enters follow mode. Below this angle, ROLL is in lock mode.

           Follow ROLL mix, deg. - Set the range (in degrees) of the camera PITCH-ing, where the
               ROLL axis is gradually switched from the 'lock' mode to 'follow' mode (see picture)

               Hint: to completely disable follow for ROLL, set these values to (90, 0). To permanently
               enable follow for ROLL (regardless of the camera PITCH-ing), set values to (0, 0).

     · Follow YAW ­ the same as above, except it can be enabled only for YAW axis. For example,
          you can lock camera by ROLL and PITCH axis by selecting "Disabled" option, but still control
          camera by YAW by enabling "Follow YAW" option.

There are additional settings to tune follow mode:

     · Dead band, degrees: you can set the range where the rotation of an outer frame does not
          affect the camera. It helps to skip small jerks when you operate gimbal by hands.

     · Expo curve: you can specify the strength of the control when outer frame declines from neutral
          position. For example: when the expo curve is enabled (i.e. is not flat), small or medium
          declination of an outer frame will cause very fine control even if I-term is configured high. But
          the strength of control exponentially grows when angles of declination becomes close to 60
          degrees. It gives a big freedom in camera operation: from fine and smooth control to very fast
          movements.

     · OFFSET: it is a very important to properly configure the initial position of the motor's magnetic
          poles, because all further calculations use this information. For YAW axis it allows to fine adjust
          a camera heading relative to a frame heading. For PITCH and ROLL axis there is an option to
          calibrate offset automatically. To do this, power on system, hold frame leveled, and press AUTO
          button. Don't forget to write setting when finished.
          If the camera after power on is not leveled, you need to adjust the offset setting.

         

· SPEED - adjust the speed of the camera rotation in the follow mode. Don't set big values that
     motors can not handle (if motor does not produce enough torque, it will skip steps and
     synchronization will be broken). In this case, acceleration limiter may help to have big speed
     but do not miss steps.

Operation in the Follow Mode

At system startup in the follow mode, keep the frame horizontally and manually adjust the camera to
the horizontal position, and adjust it's heading. Camera easily "jumps" between the magnetic poles.
Rotate the camera by hands to desired horizontal position, it will stick to the nearest magnetic pole.

                                 66
Gently rotate and tilt the frame. Turns within ± 45º will control the speed of the camera from 0 to 100%.
Camera rotates in accordance with the SPEED settings until it's angles are not equal the frame's
angles, or until given restrictions will be achieved.

If the camera moves unpredictably, perhaps its the wrong direction of rotation of the motors and you
need to change the Reverse flag in the 'Basic' tab .

To achieve the smooth motion, increase the LPF parameter (in the 'RC' tab), increase Expo curve,
and decrease the SPEED and the Acceleration limits. For more dynamic control, change these
settings in the opposite direction.

In case of failure of stabilization due to external disturbances, the camera can completely lose
synchronization with the frame . In this case, it is necessary to return it to the proper position by hands.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT to keep the frame horizontally, because at this point the frame's zero angles
are calibrated.

You can switch between modes on-the-fly by activating different profiles. Camera will keep their position
between modes.

Advanced tab

 AHRS - options influencing on camera angle determination accuracy.

      Gyro trust ­ The higher is value, the more trust to the gyro data compared with the
          accelerometer data when estimating angles. It can reduce errors caused by accelerations
          during moving, but also decreases gyro drift compensation, resulting in horizon drift over
          time. For smooth flying, it is recommended to set low values (40-80), which will give more
          stable horizon for longer time. For aggressive flying, it's better to set higher values (100-
          150).

 Accelerations compensation ­ enable it to use a physical model of multirotor to
     compensate accelerations during flight. This option works only when external FC is
     connected and calibrated.

 Serial port speed -- changes baud rate used for serial communication. Decrease it when
     using over-the-air serial adapters that can't work on maximum speed. The GUI can auto-detect
     the baud rate configured in the board.

 PWM Frequency -- sets the PWM frequency used to drive motors by power stage. Two modes
     are available : Low Frequency (in audible range) and High Frequency (outside audible range).
     In the high frequency mode it is necessary to increase the POWER setting a bit.

 Motor outputs -- you can assign hardware motor outs for any of stabilization axes. For
     example, you can use second controller for YAW stabilization and set it up this way:
     ROLL=disabled, PITCH=disabled, YAW=ROLL_OUT, and connect a YAW motor to hardware
     ROLL_OUT.

 RC Sub-Trim ­ allows to correct transmitter inaccuracy.

 ROLL, PITCH, YAW trim ­ central point trimming. Central point here is PWM 1500. It's
     better to trim it in transmitter. But in case of it is not possible (when using joystick, for
     example), you can use AUTO function in the GUI. Just place stick in center, and press
     AUTO button. Actual data becomes new center point. Press WRITE button to apply settings.

 Dead band -- adjusts a dead band around neutral point. There's no control while RC signal
     is inside this range. This feature works only in SPEED mode, and helps to achieve better
     control by eliminating jitters of stick around neutral point.

 Expo curve ­ adjusts the curvature of an exponential function, that allows to get precise
     control from RC in the range of the small values, but rough and strong control near
     endpoints. Works only in SPEED mode.

 Sensor

 Gyro LPF ­ adjusts filtering gyro data. It's not recommended to set values different than 0,

© 2013-2014 Basecamelectronics®                                                          10

                                 67
     because it will make adjusting PID controller harder. You can experiment with this.

 Gyro high sensitivity - Increases gyro sensitivity twice. Use this option for big-sized DSLR
     cameras, in case if your PID settings are close to upper limits, but stabilization still not good.
     Increasing gyro sensitivity equals to multiplying P and D values by 2.

 I2C Pullups Enable - turns ON built in I2C pull-up resistors for SDA and SCL lines.
     Use function on only if sensor doesn't work properly.

 Frame IMU ­ set the location of the frame IMU. See Second IMU sensor section of this
     manual.

Service tab

Menu Button

If you've connected menu button to BTN connector on the controller, you can assign different actions to
it.

Available actions:

      Use profile 1..5 -- loads selected profile

      Calibrate ACC ­ the accelerometer calibration, works the same way as button in the GUI.

      Calibrate Gyro ­ gyroscope calibration.

      Swap RC PITCH ­ ROLL -- temporary swap RC inputs from PITCH to ROLL. In the most
          cases only one PITCH channel is enough to control a camera in 2-axis systems. Before a flight
          you can assign control from pitch channel to roll, and make a camera precisely leveled.
          Activating this function again swaps channels back, and saves roll position in the static memory.

      Swap RC YAW ­ ROLL -- like the previous point.

      Set tilt angles by hand ­ motors will be turned off, after that you can take the camera in hands
          and fix it in the new position for a few seconds. Controller will save and hold the new position.
          This function may be useful to correct camera position before flight if there is no RC control
          connected.

      Motors toggle, Motors ON, Motors OFF - commands to change the state of the motors.

      Reset controller

Battery Monitoring

On some latest board versions there is a voltage sensor installed to monitor the main battery voltage. It
is used to apply voltage drop compensation (PID becomes stable during whole battery life-cycle), and
to make low-voltage alarms and do the motor cut-off when the battery becomes discharged.

     · Calibrate - adjusts the rate of internal multiplier to make measured voltage more precise. You
          need a multimeter to measure the real voltage, than enter this value in the calibration dialog.

     · Low voltage - alarm - set the threshold to make alarm when the voltage drops below it.

     · Low voltage - stop motors - set the threshold to stop motors when the voltage drops below it.

     · Compensate voltage drop - set this option to automatically increase the POWER parameter
          (which controls the output power goes to the motors), when the battery loose voltage due to
          discharge process.

     · Set defaults for - select the battery type to fill the fields above with the default settings for
          selected type.

          NOTE: you can add the voltage sensor to old boards in DIY way, by soldering a voltage divider
          33k/10k: 33k goes to the battery "+", 10k goes to the GND, and common point goes to the pin 19 of
          the 328p MCU (if this pin is grounded, de-solder it first).

Buzzer

On some boards there is an output to the buzzer. It is used to buzz on some events. Events are

                                 68
configured (turned ON or OFF) in the GUI. You can connect an active buzzer only (which has an
internal sound generator), working from 5..12V, currents below 40mA (check this Digikey product
search for example)

          NOTE: you can connect the buzzer to old boards in DIY way, by soldering its "+" wire to the pin 32
          of the 328p MCU, and "-" wire to the GND.

Realtime Data tab

In this tab you can see raw sensor data stream, and logical RC input levels.

      ACC_X,Y,Z ­ accelerometer data.

      GYRO_X,Y,Z ­ gyroscope data. Helps to determine quality of P and D settings. Disturb gimbal
          by hand and see trace. If it looks like sine wave, D setting is too low and gimbal tends to low-
          frequency oscillations. If some noise is always present even without any disturbance, D setting
          is too high and gimbal tends to high-frequency self-excitation.

      ERR_ROLL,PITCH,YAW ­ stabilization error graph. Same as peak indicators on the control
          panel and shows maximum deflection angle.

Each graph can be turned on or off, scale can be adjusted for Y axis. You can pause the data
transmission at any time.

Setup step-by-step sequence

1. Adjusting the mechanics

Mount the camera on the tray and balance the gimbal in all three axes. Stabilization quality strongly
depends on balance quality. To check your balance, pick your turned off gimbal in hands. Make fast
motions along all axes, try to catch resonance point and swing the gimbal. If it is hard to do - gimbal is
balanced correctly.

          NOTE : Good balance and low friction can scale down power consumption and keep good
          quality of stabilization.

If you rewound motors by yourself, it's recommended to check winding. Remove motors from gimbal,
connect them to controller and set parameters P=0, I=0.1, D=0 for each axis and set enough POWER.
Connect main power supply. Motors should spin smoothly, while rolling the sensor. Little jitter is normal
due to magnetic force between rotor and stator ("cogging" effect).

Pay great attention to sensor installation. Its axes must be parallel with motor axes. Pay attention to
mechanical links. They must be a VERY RIGID and backlash-free. Sensor provides feedback data for
stabilization, and even any little freedom or flexibility will cause delays and low-frequency resonances.
This can complicate setting of PID, and cause unstable work in real conditions (frame vibrations, wind,
etc)

2. Calibrating the sensor

Gyro is calibrated every time you turn the controller on, and it takes about 4 seconds. Try to immobilize
sensor (camera) as hard as you can in first seconds after powering on, while signal LED is blinking.
After powering on you have 3 seconds to freeze gimbal before calibration starts.

If you activated option "Skip gyro calibration at startup", gyro is not calibrated every time and controller
start working immediately after powering up. Be careful and recalibrate gyro manually, if you will notice
something wrong with IMU angles.

Calibrating Accelerometer
You must perform ACC calibration only once, but it's recommended to recalibrate it from time to time or
when the temperature significantly changes.

© 2013-2014 Basecamelectronics®      12

                                 69
 Simple calibration mode: set the sensor horizontally, and press CALIB.ACC in the GUI (or
     menu button, if it's assigned). LED will blink for 3 seconds. Try not to move sensor during
     calibration. At this step no matter how camera is leveled. You are calibrating the sensor, not the
     camera!

 Advanced mode (recommended): perform calibration in simple mode as above. Then turn
    sensor in order that each side of sensor looks up (6 positions at all, including base one). Fix the
    sensor in each position, press CALIB.ACC button in the GUI, and wait about 3-4 seconds, while
    LED if flashing. The order does not matter, but the base position always goes first (because the
    simple calibration cancels a result of advanced calibration). You have not to press WRITE
    button, calibration data is written automatically after each step.

    NOTE: Precise accelerometer calibration is a very important for horizon holding during
    dynamic flying or YAW rotation.

4. Tuning basic settings

      Connect the main power supply.

      Set POWER according to the motor configuration (see recommendations above)

      Auto-detect number of poles and motors direction. Do not proceed to next step until proper
          direction will be detected!

      Adjust PID controller. To check stabilization quality, use peak indicator in the control panel
          (shown by the blue traces and blue numbers). Incline the frame by small angles and try to
          minimize peak values by increasing P, I and D to its maximum. You may use gyro data from
          Realtime Data tab to estimate stabilization quality, too.
          Better to tune PID with the "Follow Mode" turned OFF for all axes.

Suggested algorythm for PID tuning:

1. Set I=0.01, P=10, D=10 for all axes. Gimbal should be stable at this moment. If not,
     decrease P and D a bit. Than start to tune each axis sequentially:

2. Gradually increase P until motor starts oscillate (you may knock camera and see on the
     gyro graph, how fast oscillation decays). Increase D a little ­ it should damp oscillations,
     and decay time decreases. The lower is decay time, the better.

3. Repeat step 2 until D reaches its maximum, when high-frequency vibration appears (you
     may feel it by hands and see noisy line on the gyro graph). Current P and D values are
     maximum for your setup, decrease them a little and go to step 4

4. Increase I until low-frequency oscillation starts. Decrease I a little to keep gimbal stable.

© 2013-2014 Basecamelectronics®                                                          13

                                     70
               Now you found a maximum for all PID values for selected axis. Repeat from step 1 for
               other axes.
          5. When all axes are tuned in static, try to move gimbal's frame, emulating a real work. You
               may notice that cross-influence of axes may make gimbal not stable. In this case, decrease
               a little PID values from its maximum for axes that looses
The result of good tuning ­ stabilization error is less than 1 degree when you slightly rock a gimbal's
frame.

5. Connecting and configuring RC

     · Connect one of the free receiver's channels to RC_PITCH input, preserving right polarity
In the RC Settings tab:

     · Set SORCE=PWM

     · Assign RC_PITCH input to PITCH axis

     · Leave all other axes and CMD as "no input"

     · For PITCH axis, set MIN.ANGLE=-90, MAX.ANGLE=90, ANGLE MODE=checked, LPF=5,
          SPEED=10 (not used in angle mode)

     · Connect the battery to the main controller and receiver, and check that RC_PITCH input
          receives data in the "Realtime Data" tab (slider should be blue filled and reflects to stick
          movement)

Now you can control the camera from your RC transmitter, from -90 to 90 degrees. If you are not
satisfied with the speed of movement, adjust the I-term setting for PITCH in the "Basic" tab.
Try the SPEED mode and feel difference with the ANGLE mode.
Connect and tune remaining axes the same way, as required.

6. Testing gimbal in real conditions

Connect controller to the GUI and turn ON multirotor motors, holding it above your head. Check the
vibrations on the camera by using Realtime Data tab / ACC raw data. Try to decrease the level of
vibrations using soft dampers.

          NOTE: Brushless motors versus traditional servos provide faster reaction, but less torque.
          That's why it's hard for them to fight against wind and air flows from props. If you are developing
          multirotor frame by yourself, try to avoid this influences (for example, lengthen arms a bit, or tilt
          motors away from center or place camera above props in case of H-frame). Also bear in mind,
          when copter moves with high speed, an air flow is deflected and can affect the gimbal.

Status LED

There are 2 LEDs on board. Red led lights when power is connected. Green/blue LED signals show actual
state of the system:

      LED is off -- pause before calibration, to take hands off or to level gimbal.

      LED blinks slowly ­ Calibration is in action. Freeze gimbal during this process.

      LED blinks fast -- system error, stabilization cannot be performed. To check error description,
          connect to GUI.

      LED is on -- normal operation mode.

      LED is on, but blinks irregularly ­ I2C errors appears.
Also, additional LEDs may present to signal serial communication on RX and TX line.
