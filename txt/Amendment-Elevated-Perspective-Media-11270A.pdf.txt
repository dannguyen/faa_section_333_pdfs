                                                      Exemption No. 11270A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0930

Mr. Thomas Webb
Treasurer
Elevated Perspective Media
36 Post Road
Warwick, RI 02888

Dear Mr. Webb:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 19, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Elevated Perspective Media (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to
your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection and closed-set motion
picture and television filming. You requested an amendment to add the DJI S1000 and
Xfoldrig.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11270
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11270 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Aervonics Sky Jib,
    Vulcan, DJI S1000, and Xfoldrig when weighing less than 55 pounds including
    payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
    petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Re: Amendment to Exemption 11270 issued pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Reform
Act and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations in Regulatory Docket FAA-2014-0930

         Dear Sir or Madam;

         Elevated Perspective Media was issued an Exemption numbered 11270 (hereinafter
the Exemption) for the purpose of conducting scripted, closed-set filming for the motion
picture and television industry. Elevated Perspective media herby requests an amendment
to the Exemption to allow an additional type of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) that fully
complies with the conditions of the Exemption.

         Elevated Perspective Media wishes to operate a DJI S1000 and a Xfoldrig using a DJI
A2 controller (both additional UAS's are the same size and power as the already exempted
aervonics skyjib) under the same terms and conditions contained in the Exemption. All
operations of the additional UAS's will be in full compliance with the terms of the Exemption.

         As this is an amendment to an existing exemption asking for only the addition of
another type of unmanned aerial vehicle, Elevated Perspective Media respectfully submits
that good cause exists so that notice does not need to be published in the Federal Register
for the requested amendment.

         Please contact the undersigned should you have any question concerning this
request for an amendment to the Exemption.

Sincerely yours,

Thomas Webb
Vice President
