                                                      Exemption No. 11400A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0155

Counsel for Contend LLC

Dear Mr. McKinnon:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 14, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Contend LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your current
exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to revise the operator name.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11400
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
                                                                                                                  2
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to revise the operator name.
The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.
Conditions and Limitations
All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11400 remain in effect.
Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.
This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.
Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

        Re: FAA-2015-0155 ­ Amendment to Exemption 11400

Dear Ms. Daniels:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ("Reform
Act") and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Contend LLC hereby submits the following amendment to its
Petition for Exemption granted on April 20, 2015.

         The Petition for Exemption correctly states in the body of the document that the
exemption is sought by Contend LLC. However, due to an error, it appears that the exemption
was inadvertently granted to Contend Corporation. The correct name of the petitioner is, in fact,
"Contend LLC," and there is no entity named "Contend Corporation." Accordingly, petitioner
respectfully requests that the Grant of Exemption be amended, and that all references to
"Contend Corporation" be replaced with "Contend LLC."

         Contend LLC does not seek any changes to any of the conditions or limitations in the
original grant. As such, this amendment is suitable for approval through a Summary Grant. In
addition, the requested amendment is in the public interest, as having the petitioner correctly
identified in the Grant of Exemption will avoid confusion and further the FAA's interests in
accountability.

         If you have any questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to
call.

                   MCKENNA LONG & ALDRIDGE

                   Mark E. McKinnon, Esq.
