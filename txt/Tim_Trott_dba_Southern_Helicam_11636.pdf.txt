                                                           Exemption No. 11636
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0594

Mr. Tim Trott
dba Southern Helicam
3628 Seminole Lane
Marianna, FL 32448

Dear Mr. Trott:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter posted March 11, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
for an exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft
system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography and videography for real estate.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received one comment in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 and DJI Phantom 2 Vision.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Tim Trott dba Southern Helicam is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Tim Trott dba Southern Helicam is hereafter referred to as
the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2 and
         DJI Phantom 2 Vision when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
         Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
         amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
                                                                                                            4

    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
                                                                                                            5

    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

Re: Exemption Request Pursuant To Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act of 2012

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing pursuant to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012 (the "Reform Act")
and the procedures contained in 14 C.F .R. 11, to request that Tim Trott, owner and and
operator of small UAS, be exempted from the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR's) listed below.

The exemption is necessary to operate a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) commercially
in airspace regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These operations will be
conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA
as required by Section 333.§11.81.

It is requested that the following aspects of Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform
Act of 2012 be considered:

                             Petition for Exemption under Section #333 of the
                  FAA Modernizations and Reform Act of 2012 and 14 CFR Part 11

         91.409(a)(1) and (2)
         91.417(a) and (b)

(3) Extent of Relief and reason for seeking relief:

         14 CFR, § 45.22(d) allows the UAS owner or operator to propose an alternative marking
         procedure to the FAA. Alternate marking approvals may be issued to public aircraft by
         FAA UAS Integration Office (AFS-80). If alternative markings were required , a copy of
         the Alternative Marking approval letter should be attached to application in the "Aircraft
         Registration" field.

         The petitioner requests permission for 1 inch markings applied on the top surface of the
         body of the aircraft.

         CFR 61.113 (a) & (b) Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations:

         Pilot in Command:
         Petitioner requests to be permitted for commercial operation of a small UAS PIC
         operating the UAS will have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with 14
         CFR 61.51(b), at least 10 hours logged as a UAS pilot with a multi-rotor UAS.

         CFR §61.3(a)(1): Requirement for certificates, ratings, and authorizations
         Applicant has completed ground school for PAR/AKT and other qualification tests.

         63.13 -Certificates ratings and authorizations

         CFR 91.7(a) Civil Aircraft Airworthiness:
         In the absence of an airworthiness certification process for sUAS, the equivalent level of
         safety will be achieved through the employment of flight manual and maintenance
         manual procedures, pilot training and analytical risk management for each activity.

         CFR 91.119 (d) (1) Minimum safe altitudes; general
         CFR 91.119 states:

                   (d) Helicopters, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control aircraft. If the
                   operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface-

                             (1) A helicopter may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in
                             paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, provided each person operating the
                             helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for
                             helicopters by the FAA.

         The current altitude and/or horizontal restrictions on rotorcraft assumes a much heavier
         manned aircraft loaded with fuel and possible external stores. The light-weight sUAS
         being proposed for use in this activity along with its guidance and redundant systems
         should taken into consideration.
         The activities being proposed by this petitioner are in a very controlled and open area.
         The flights would be confined to overflight of the client real estate at the request of and
         with permission from the land owner, and maintain a distance of more than 50 feet away
         from any buildings, persons, active highways or railroads, and below the 400 ft AGL
         limitation.

         CFR 91.121 Altimeter settings

         CFR 91.121 states: Each person operating an aircraft shall maintain the cruising altitude
         or flight level of that aircraft, as the case may be, by reference to an altimeter that is set,
         when operating-Below 18,000 feet MSL, to-The current reported altimeter setting of a
         station along the route and within 100 nautical miles of the aircraft.

         The sUAS aircraft intended for this activity uses an onboard GPS which transmits
         altitude and location information to the PIC on the ground in real time. A phone APP,
         SkyRadar, uses separate GPS data to confirm altitude and location data for the launch
         location. It is stipulated that the UAS will be operated below 400 ft AGL at all times and
         during daylight hours only.

         14 C.F.R. §91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

         Section 91.151(a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under
         VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is
         enough fuel to fly to he first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising
         speed ­ (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes . . . ."

         The UAV is 100% electric and two low battery alerts are issued - per the operating
         documents, the UAV will be landed at the first alert. Flights are expected to be 5-10
         minutes each, and the UAS has an automated function which results in immediate safe
         landing which is initiated when a low battery is detected. The PIC will not begin a flight
         unless there is more than 75% battery power remaining.

         91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), 91.417(a) and (b)
         The petitioner states that an exemption from 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(2) and
         91.417(a) and (b) Maintenance inspections may be required and should be granted
         since they only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. However, the petitioner
         states as a safety precaution preflight inspections will be performed on the UAS before
         each flight as outlined in the operating documents (check lists) provided.

(4) How this exemption would affect the public as a whole:

Low altitude aerial photography and video can provide a more detailed visual perspective of a
real estate property, especially larger tracts. Standard aircraft cannot safely operate below 500
feet and Google Earth satellite images may not show recent changes such as timber clear cuts,
excavation for development or effects of erosion. The proposed service will provide the public
with an economical alternative to the noise and safety issues related to low flying aircraft or
helicopters while providing a better perspective of the subject property than can be obtained
from ground level. A supporting document has been included in this filing.

(5) Reasons why would not adversely affect safety or how would provide a level of safety
equal to existing rule:

             · Applicant has maintained a flight and maintenance log for all aircraft from start of
                   ownership.

         (b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or
         over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest
         obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.

         (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except
         over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be
         operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.

         (d) Helicopters, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control aircraft. If the operation is
         conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface--

                   (1) A helicopter may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in
                   paragraph
                   (b) or (c) of this section, provided each person operating the helicopter complies
                   with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA; and
                   (2) A powered parachute or weight-shift-control aircraft may be operated at less
                   than the minimums prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

Section 91.121 requires, in pertinent part, each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising
altitude by reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure."

Section 91.151(a) prescribes that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR
conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly
to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, (1) during the day, to
fly after that for at least 30 minutes [emphasis added].

Section 91.203(a) prohibits, in pertinent part, any person from operating a civil aircraft unless it
has within it (1) an appropriate and current airworthiness certificate; and (2) an effective U.S.
registration certificate issued to its owner or, for operation within the United States, the second
copy of the Aircraft registration Application as provided for in § 47.31(c).

Section 91.203(b) prescribes, in pertinent part, that no person may operate a civil aircraft
unless the airworthiness certificate or a special flight authorization issued under § 91.715 is
displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

Section 91.405(a) requires, in pertinent part, that an aircraft operator or owner shall have that
aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of the same part and shall, between required
inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of the same section, have discrepancies
repaired as prescribed in part 43 of the chapter.

Section 91.407(a)(1) prohibits, in pertinent part, any person from operating an aircraft that has

                   aircraft is approved for return to service.

The petitioner supports this request with the following information:

The petitioner has provided the following information, contained in his petition and supporting
documentation including (attached):

    · N number registration
    · Aircraft registration
    · Gold Seal Ground School document
    · AOPA UAS safety course document
    · Unmanned Experts IQT1 (UAV) course document
    · Safety Operation Procedures manual
    · Checklists ­ Preflight, logging, postflight
    · Flight and maintenance log (with notarized statement)
    · Observer/Spotter Checklist manual
    · Supporting document from Realtor®

         Flight and Maintenance log (10+ hours flight time)
    · Insurance Quotation
    · DJI Operating Manual P2V (N741TT)
    · DJI Operating Manual P2 Zenmuse H3-3D (N742TT)

                             (All hereinafter referred to as operating documents).

Exemption Request:

The petitioner requests that given the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated
with the aircraft to be utilized, an exemption from 14 CFR part 21, Subpart H (Airworthiness
Certificates) and § 91.203 (a) and (b) (Certifications required), subject to certain conditions and
limitations, is warranted and meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety under 14
CFR part 11 and Section 333 of P.L. 112-95 (Section 333).

Petitioner requests an exemption from § 45.23 Marking of the aircraft because his UA will not
have a cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or phrases. Further, he
states that two-inch lettering is difficult to place on such a small aircraft with dimensions smaller
than the minimal lettering requirement. Regardless of this, petitioner states that he will mark his
UAS in the largest possible lettering by placing assigned N number on its fuselage as required
by § 45.29(f) so that he or anyone assisting as a spotter will see the markings. The lettering will
be 1 inch in height.

The petitioner states that exemption from §§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(2) and
91.417(a) and (b) Maintenance inspections may be required and should be granted since they
only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. However, the petitioner states as a safety
precaution he will perform a preflight inspection of his UAS before each flight as outlined in his
operating documents. The petitioner has maintained a maintenance log for all aircraft since
acquiring them. As propellers do not have serial numbers they are replaced as necessary for
signs of wear or damage.

UAS Pilot in Command (PIC)
The petitioner asserts that under § 61.113 (a) and (b) private pilots are limited to non-
commercial operations, however the petitioner can achieve an equivalent level of safety as
achieved by current regulations because the UAS does not carry any pilots or passengers.
Petitioner further indicates that the risks of operating a UAS are far less than the risk levels
inherent in the commercial activities outlined in 14 CFR part 61, et seq., thus requests an
exemption from § 61.113 Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in command so as to be
allowed to provide commercial services with a small (micro) UAV including flight and safety
instruction.

         Command. 

 
MAINTENANCE AND LOG BOOK RECORDS3: 

     Any damage or worn out parts are to be replaced or repaired before the next flight occurs. Log 
         book records will be used to log aircraft flight times as well as all maintenance, repairs, and 
         replacements.  

     Each aircraft should have an identifying (manufacturer's serial) number that can be connected 
         to the aircraft and corresponding aircraft log book.  

     The flight and maintenance logbook forms shall be made available to the FAA for inspection.  
     All repaired aircraft shall be tested, deemed airworthy, and so noted in the maintenance 

         logbook before resumption of duties.

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote control and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control system

connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more

information.

1.2 Connections with Other DJI Products

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G Wi-Fi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote control's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range

during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Control Operation

  The operations of remote control are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote control are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote control is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

Control    nose direction
(Mode 2)                                  The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                                          Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                          Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                          The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                                          altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                          Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                          position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                                          suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                          prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                          elevation changes.

                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                                      clock-wise.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      forward.
                                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                                      stick is centered.
                                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                                      faster flight velocity.
                                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                                      centered.
                                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in
                                                      a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote control and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

A                                         BC          D

                                          Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote control.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Control Operation> for

      more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 |
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
          4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote control is lost. The flight control system
will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote control and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote control is powered off.
2 The remote control is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must have

        been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote control.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the aircraft, essentially reducing

        the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

©2013-2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 |
Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures

1 Record Home Point.                       2 Flying.                                         3 Remote controller signal lost.

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
        will descend automatically.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
control from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position as
a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks on
the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:
1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is

        recorded last time.
2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

                      distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote control's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,
                      make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.

3 Preparing the Remote Control

  The PHANTOM 2 VISION remote control is a wireless communication device that uses the 5.8GHz frequency
  band. It is compliant with CE and FCC (see the FCC ID) regulations and is set to Mode 2 before delivery. The
  compliance version can be configured by twisting the potentiometer knob on the back of the remote controller.
  The stick configuration can also be reset in the PHANTOM RC Assistant. Refer to the PHANTOM RC Assistant
  and the Compliance Version Configuration (Page 12) for details.

(1) CE compliant devices have an effective communication range of 300 meters in open spaces due
       to power limitations. Be sure to watch your fight distance as the PHANTOM 2 VISION will enter
       Failsafe mode (auto-landing or go home and land) if it flies beyond this range.

(2) FCC compliant devices have an effective range of 500 meters in open spaces. Be sure to watch
       your fight distance as the PHANTOM 2 VISION will enter Failsafe mode (auto-landing or go
       home and land) if it flies beyond this range.

(3) Pay attention to and follow local laws and regulations.

indicating the remote controller and receiver is linking. Once fully linked, the power indicator will change
to a solid green.

(1) If the low voltage warning alert sounds (refer to the Remote Control Power Indicator Status
        Information (Page 9)), please replace batteries as soon as possible.

(2) Using the incorrect type of battery may prevent a risk of damage.
(3) Remove the batteries after use and dispose of them safely.
(4) For long term storage, be sure to remove the batteries from the remote control.

3.3 Remote Control Power Indicator Status Information

                                     Low voltage (lower than 3.9V). The remote control will automatically
                 BBBB                power off. Batteries should be replaced immediately.
                                     The remote control will display a blinking green light and sound an alarm
                 B-B-B......         after 15 minutes without operator input. The alarm status will disappear
                                     once you start operation of the remote control.

The remote control will blink the LED and sound an alert when the voltage drops below 3.9V and
automatically power off after 3 seconds. This process will repeat even if you power cycle the remote
control. If this low voltage warning occurs during flight, the remote control will automatically power off
causing the aircraft to enter Failsafe mode, which cannot be interrupted (refer to the Failsafe Function
(Page 32) for details). It is strongly recommended to replace batteries if the 3.9V-4.5V low voltage
warning occurs.

                                       The remote control's antenna should be
                                       pointing skyward with no obstacles in the way.
                                       Otherwise, the Failsafe function may initialize
                                       prematurely during flight.
                                       The Mobile Device and Range Extender should
                                       not block the antenna.

3.5 Remote Control Operation

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote control are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote control is pushed away from the central position.

                                       The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                                       Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                       Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                       The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its height
                                       if the sticks are centered.
                                       Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                       position to make the aircraft take-off. When flying, we
                                       suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                       prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                       elevation changes.

                        The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder.
                        Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                        clock-wise.
                        Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                        clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                        remain facing the same direction.
                        The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                        the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                        results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                        The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                        Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                        forward.
                        Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                        backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                        stick is centered.
                        Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                        will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and
                        faster flight velocity.
                        The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                        Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                        Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                        The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                        centered.

                                  6-10 times, which will force the aircraft to enter into
                                  compass calibration mode.

             (1) For `Ready to Fly' the aircraft will hover (hold a stable horizontal position) when all sticks are
                      released.

             (2) For `Ready to Fly (non-GPS)' the aircraft will keep the aircraft level without horizontal
                      positioning when all sticks are released.

3.6 Link between the Remote Control and Receiver
There is a 5.8G receiver in the PHANTOM 2 VISION, with the link button and indicator located on the bottom of
the aircraft as illustrated in the following diagram.

4 Preparing the Range Extender

  The PHANTOM 2 VISION range extender is a wireless communication device that operates within the 2.4 GHz
  frequency band and is used for extending the effective range of communication between a mobile device
  (Smartphone) and the PHANTOM 2 VISION. In an open unobstructed area, the transmission distance can reach
  up to 300 meters, but is usually affected by the surrounding environment, such as trees, buildings and other
  sources of the same frequency. Before every flight, it is suggested that you ensure the range extender functions
  properly. Otherwise you may experience a communication issue with the mobile device and the PHANTOM 2
  VISION.
  Each range extender has a unique MAC address and network name (SSID), details of which are printed on the
  back label as `Phantom_xxxxxx'. The `xxxxxx' represents the last six letters or numbers of the MAC address
  for the range extender.

7.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes
   It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300
          times.
   It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge
          cycles. Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can
          no longer be turned on. Refer to the DJI VISION App for an exact readout of the battery percentage
          level. You should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling procedure will
          ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
   Turn the power OFF when you have finished flying and remove the battery from its compartment.
          NEVER plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
   Take the battery out of the aircraft after every flight and store the battery in a safe and secure place. For
          long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box securely.
          We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it in good
          condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
   Adhere to the notes for the battery in the disclaimer and regard safety as your first priority.
   The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 10 to 40, and be discharged in an
          environment that is between -20 to 60. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
          that the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
   It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
   Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
   Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
          concrete and never near any flammable materials.

8.2 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions
  The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards
  and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller
  contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver and LED indicators. The IMU (Inertial
  Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both attitude and
  altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System) to
  accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver
  is used to communicate with the remote control and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control
  system connecting and controlling all the modules together.

8.3 LED Flight Indicators Description
After powering on the intelligent battery, the LED flight indicators light up to show the aircraft's current status.

10 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.
  The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads
  to poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to
  perform at its optimal level.

10.1 Calibration Warnings
          (1) DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong magnetic
                   interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement underground.
          (2) DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular phones.
          (3) Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will not work properly.

10.2 Calibration Procedures
Choose an open space to carry out the following procedures. Please watch the quick start video of the PHANTOM

2 VISION for more compass calibration details.

       Quickly flip the switch S1               360o Rotate the aircraft                                                                                                                                                                                  360oRotate the aircraft

10.3 When Recalibration Is Required
(1) When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
(2) Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
(3) The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
(4) Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

11 Flight

11.1 Flying Environment Requirements
             (1) Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                     practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).
             (2) DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
             (3) The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure
                     within buildings may interfere with the compass.
             (4) Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
             (5) Try to avoid interference between the remote control and other wireless equipment. (No base
                     stations or cell towers around)
             (6) The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
             (7) All parts must be kept out of the reach of children to avoid CHOKING HAZARDS; if a child has
                     accidentally swallowed any part, you should seek immediate medical assistance.

11.2 Starting/Stopping the Motors
A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors instead of simply pushing the throttle stick up.
This is a safety precaution to prevent the motors from accidentally spinning up. Push both sticks to their bottom
corners as indicated in the diagram below to start the motors. Once the motors have spun up, release both sticks
simultaneously. The same combination stick command (CSC) is used to stop the motors.

11.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures
  1. Start by placing the PHANTON 2 VISION on the ground with the battery level indicator facing you.
  2. Power on the remote control.
  3. Power on the range extender.
  4. Switch the camera to the "WIFI ON" position.
  5. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery, refer to the Battery Usage (Page 24) for details.
  6. Connect the mobile device to the PHANTOM 2 VISION and then run the DJI VISION App to enter the
          camera preview page.

©2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 31 |
  7. Wait until the LED flight indicator starts to slowly blink green/yellow. This means the aircraft is initializing
          and entering the "Ready to Fly"/"Ready to Fly (non-GPS)" state. Then proceed to execute the CSC
          command to start motors.

  8. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to the Remote Control Operation
          (Page 10) for more details.

  9. Enjoy your flight while capturing and recording with the DJI VISION App. Refer to the Using DJI VISION
          App (Page 42) for more details.

  10. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  11. After landing the aircraft on the ground, keep the throttle stick at its lowest position for about 3 to 5

          seconds which will automatically stop the motors.

             You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
             aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
             (1) When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                     Failsafe mode, refer to the Failsafe Function (Page 32) for details.
             (2) A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                     rapidly during flight. Refer to the Low Battery Level Warning Function (Page 34) for details.
             (3) Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
             (4) Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                     temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                     battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.

11.4 Failsafe Function
  The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote control is lost. The flight control
  system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The
  following situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote control and enter Failsafe
  mode:
  (1) The remote control is powered off.
  (2) The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote control.
  (3) There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the aircraft, essentially reducing
      the distance the signal can travel.
  (4) There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during descent and landing process.

©2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 32 |
Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

Home Point
When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as the
home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being able to
fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.
Dynamic Home Point

The Home point will be reset to position of the mobile device at specific time intervals.
(1) Enable dynamic home point in DJI Vision app or Phantom 2 Assistant.
(2) Dynamic home point is only available to the GPS-enabled mobile device. Turn on GPS and data service to obtain

    higher accuracy of the mobile device position.
                          point is useful in situations when you are in motion and require a Home point that is different

    from the takeoff point.

(1) In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft will
   descend automatically.

(2) Aircraft cannot navigate around vertical obstacles on its return home course during Failsafe. However,
    you can set return home altitude value in Phantom Assistant to avoid hitting vertical obstacles
    through DJI Phantom Assistant.

In Phantom 2 Vision mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly"
status as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the
remote control from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft
position as a new home point of PHANTOM 2 VISION. When successfully reset, you will see a series of
rapid green blinks on the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is: i) The home point is the
place PHANTOM 2 VISION returns to when the control signal is lost, which is recorded last time. ii) The

home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the distance will be
displayed on the DJI VISION App.

11.5 Low Battery Level Warning Function
  If the DJI smart battery is depleted to a point that may affect the safe return of the aircraft, the low battery level
  warning notifies users to take action. Users are advised to land the aircraft immediately when they observe
  these warnings. The thresholds for these warnings are automatically determined based on the current aircraft
  altitude and its distance from the Home point. Details of the battery level warning are listed below:

11.6.2 Flight Limits of Special Areas
Restricted areas include airports worldwide. All restricted areas are listed on the DJI official website at
http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-mc. Restricted areas are divided into category A and category B. Category A
areas cover major international airport such as LAX and Heathrow, while category B areas includes smaller airports.
Category A Safety Zone
 The category A "safety zone" is comprised of a small "no-fly zone" and a range of "restricted-altitude zones".

   Flight is prevented in the "no-fly zone" but can continue with height restrictions in the restricted-altitude zone.
 1.5 miles (2.4 km) around a designated safety zone is a no-fly zone, inside which takeoff is prevented.
 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to 5 miles (8 km) around restricted areas are altitude restricted, with maximum altitude going

   from 35 feet (10.5 m) at 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to 400 feet (120 m) at 5 miles (8 km).
 A "warning zone" has been set around the safety zone. When you fly within 320 feet (100m) of the safety zone, a

   warning message will appear on the DJI Vision app.

                                                                      Category A
Category B Safety Zone
 Category B "safety zone" is comprised of a "no-fly zone" and a "warning zone".
 0.6 miles (1 km) around the safety zone is a designated "no-fly zone".
 A "warning zone" has been set around the safety zone. When you fly within 0.6 miles (1Km) of this zone, a warning

   will appear on the DJI Vision app.

(1) When flying in the safety zone, LED flight indicators will blink red                             quickly

           and continue for 3 seconds, then switch to indicate current flying status and continue for 5

           seconds at which point it will switch back to red blinking.

(2) For safety reasons, please do not fly close to airports, highways, railway stations, railway lines,

           city centers and other special areas. Try to ensure the aircraft is visible.

11.6.3 Conditions of Flight Limits

In different working modes and flight modes, flight limits will differ according to number of GPS satellites found.

The following table demonstrates all the cases(: available; ×: unavailable).
All flights are restricted by height, distance and special areas simultaneously. The Failsafe and Ground Station

operations are not restricted to flight limits, but if Ground Station function is used, the flight will be restricted the

special area limits built in to Ground Station. Refer to the Ground Station manual for details.

12.6.2 Using Ground Station
Step 1 Launching Ground Station
Enable ground station feature from DJI Vision app Settings and a disclaimer for ground station prompts. Read the
disclaimer thoroughly before starting to use ground station.

Ensure your mobile device has access to the Internet. Due to the map data required, Wi-Fi connection is
recommended. Internet access is required to cache the ground station map, if Wi-Fi is unavailable, mobile data
service is required. Open the DJI Vision app camera GUI and swipe left to launch ground station. DJI Vision app
cannot connect to your aircraft while it is accessing the Internet. Hence, you may prompt with the warning message
such as "Connection to Phantom Failed". This message will not appear when your aircraft is re-connected to DJI
Vision app. Map data of your current location will load. You can then drag the map to cache nearby areas for future
use.

Step 2 Setting a Waypoint

Disconnect from the Internet and connect the DJI Vision app to your aircraft. Check that remote control S1 switch is

in position (position-1) and the upper left corner in ground station display  and wait for the aircraft to

enter "Ready-to-Fly" mode (LED indicator blinking green) before swiping left into ground station. Tap on the map to

place a waypoint. You can place up to 16 waypoints including the Home point. Waypoints cannot be placed beyond

500m from the Home point or inside No Waypoint Areas.

©2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 58 |
             (1) A red circle on the map, as shown in the screenshot below, indicates a restricted, No Waypoint
                      area. Waypoints cannot be placed in this area. For more information, refer to the Flight Limits of
                      Special Areas (Page 38).

             (2) To achieve the optimal video transmission quality, the aircraft is set to operate within a
                      500m-radius area from Home point.

Tap on a waypoint to open a waypoint properties window. Modify longitude and latitude value from the input box.
Slide the white dot right to adjust waypoint altitude. The default altitude is set to 98 feet (20 m) and can be
adjusted from 0 to 650 feet (200 m). Tap "OK" to save waypoint settings. To delete current waypoint, tap .

Step 3 Preview a Mission
Tap "Done" to preview the mission when all waypoints are set. A prompt similar to the one below will appear.
©2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 59 |
This prompt lists all waypoints and their altitudes. The aircraft will fly to each waypoint listed. If there is a difference
in altitude between waypoints, the aircraft will adjust its altitude as it flies between points. When ready, tap "GO" to
begin mission.

          Aircraft reacts differently to the "GO" command
          (1) If aircraft is on the ground, the aircraft takes off automatically and ascend 16 feet (5m) then fly to

                 the first waypoint.
          (2) If aircraft is in the air, the aircraft flies to the first waypoint.

Step 4 Executing Flight Mission

The aircraft flies to each waypoint in numerical order. As it flies, swipe back into the DJI Vision app camera GUI to

control camera tilt and capture photos or video. Tap to pause the mission during the flight, and aircraft will

then start hovering. Tap to resume mission. If you wish to regain control of the aircraft, toggle the S1 switch on

remote control from  (Position-1) to either (Position-2) or (Position-3) to discontinue the current

mission.

Step 5 Landing
When all waypoints have been visited, the aircraft will return to its Home point and hover. Regain control of the
aircraft and land it manually. You may also tap button to initiate "Go Home" procedure. Aircraft will abort
current mission, return to Home point and auto land.

14 Troubleshooting (FAQ)

14.1 How to solve large margin(s) mid-point error?

If the Remote Control stick(s) mid-point margin of error is too big, the motors will fail to start when you execute the
Combination Stick Commands (CSC) and the aircraft will not take off. Below are possible situations where the
Remote Control's stick(s) mid-point margins of error could be too big:
(1) One of the Remote Control's stick position (except the throttle stick) is not centered when powering on the
PHANTOM 2 VISION.
Solution: Place all Remote Control sticks at their mid-point positions and then power cycle the PHANTOM 2
VISION to re-record the mid-point. If the problem persists, this can be caused by scenario (2).
(2) The Remote Control sticks have been trimmed which leads to a large deviation of the mid-point position.
Solution: Use the Assistant to perform a Remote Control calibration. To do so, carry out the following procedures.

    (a) Connect to the Assistant, tap Basic-> RC-> Command Sticks Calibration, and push all Remote Control sticks
    through their complete travel range to see if any stick cannot reach its outer most position.
    (b) Power cycle the PHANTOM 2 VISION. Note that a power cycle is required.
    (c) Redo the Remote Control calibration according to the Assistant.
If the above solutions do not solve your issue, please send your Remote Control to DJI Customer service for repair.

14.2 How to restore a video file if power is turned off during a recording session?

Solution: Keep or place the Micro-SD card back into the camera. Power cycle the camera and wait about 30
seconds for the video file to be restored.

14.3 Failure to acquire the SSID.

Solution: Double check whether both the camera and Range Extender are powered on and the power switch of the
camera is switched to "WIFI ON".

14.4 What to do if PHANTOM 2 VISION is out of sight and the Wi-Fi connections is lost?

Solution: Turn off the Remote Control to trigger the Failsafe mode and the aircraft will start to fly back, descend,
and land at the Home point automatically. Please make sure there are no obstacles within the go home route and
you are familiar with the regaining control procedure.

14.5 Wi-Fi connection fails all the time.

Solution: Double check the current Wi-Fi connection status of the mobile device. The mobile device may be
connecting to other Wi-Fi networks after a connection breaks with the PHANTOM 2 VISION.

14.6 Files fail to synchronize.

©2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 66 |
Solution: Video files that are too large (file sizes close to 4GB) cannot be synchronized to the mobile device. Some
mobile devices also fail to support synchronization of the 1080i60 video files.

14.7 Albums fail to synchronize.

Solution: Reset the settings of your mobile device as illustrated below. Enable the Settings ->Private->Photos->DJI
VISION. Otherwise the Albums will fail to synchronize with your mobile device.

14.8 Failure to share.

Solution: Please make sure the mobile device has access to the Internet.

14.9 Some mobile Android devices have a problem connecting to the PHANTOM 2 VISION
Wi-Fi Extender.

Solution: Some mobile Android devices do not allow for both a Wi-Fi connection and a mobile data connection at
the same time. When trying to connect to the PHANTOM 2 VISION Wi-Fi network, most devices will check whether
an Internet connection has a certain Wi-Fi setting enabled, e.g. Auto network switch or Test for Internet connection.
If no Internet connection is found because the PHANTOM 2 VISION creates a non-routable connection it will drop
the PHANTOM 2 VISION Wi-Fi network connection and scan for the next available connection. Example: For the
Samsung Note 3, carry out the following procedures to solve this issue. Tap Settings -> Wi-Fi, and then tap the
"Menu" button. Select "Advanced" then uncheck the "Auto network switch". You might see a warning that indicates
the Internet connection is unstable but just ignore this message.

14.10 Usage tips for the App used on multiple mobile devices.

During flight, if you use the App on multiple mobile devices, please turn off the App on the first mobile device, and
©2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 67 |
then turn on the App on the second one to ensure the App can work normally on the second mobile device.

14.11 How to land the aircraft smoothly in a better way?

First pull the throttle stick position down to lower than 5%, then execute the CSC command to stop the motors.

14.12 Why the discharge cycle of a new battery not at zero?

A battery aging test is performed prior to delivery which affects the discharge time of the new battery. This is why
the discharge time of a new battery is not zero. The battery is okay to use.

14.13 What if I accidently exit DJI Vision App when aircraft is still operating under ground station
mode?

 If DJI Vision App is closed when aircraft is executing flight mission, aircraft continues with the remaining
         flight mission.

 If DJI Vision App is closed and failed to re-connect with aircraft within 1 minute, aircraft returns home point
         automatically.

14.14 Do I need extra equipment to use ground station?

No extra equipment is required.

14.15 Can I cache map data for future use?

Yes, user can cache map data in ground station for future use.
