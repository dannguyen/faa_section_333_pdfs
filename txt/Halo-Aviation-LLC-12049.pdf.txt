                                                           Exemption No. 12049
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1503

Mr. Vaden B. Francisco, Jr.
Hutchinson, Cox, Coons, Orr and Sherlock, P.C.
Counsel for Halo Aviation, LLC
400 Woolworth Building

Dear Mr. Francisco:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 22, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Halo Aviation, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and videography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is the Blade 350QX.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Halo Aviation, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Halo Aviation, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Blade 350QX
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT (UA):
     · A lightweight (24-ounce gross weight with all on-board equipment),
         battery operated 4-motor rotorcraft in the form of a quadcopter that
         takes off and lands vertically, capable of carrying the following
         equipment in flight;
     · An on-board flight computer with GPS navigation and location ability
         that receives signals for flight controls from a ground-based

       transmitterI controller modified;

     · An on-board Go Pro camera capable of capturing imagery in the form
         of full color, high definition still photos and video;

    · An on-board telemetry system operating at 5.8GHz that delivers flight
         data from the on-board flight computer to the on-board radio
         transmitter including altitude AGL, horizontal and vertical speed,
         compass direction of flight and direction back to its launch site;

     · A Dx5e DSMX 5 2.4GHz on-board radio transmitter that transmits the
         flight data from the telemetry system described above.

THE GROUND STATION-BASED PART OF THE SYSTEM:
    · A Pilot in Command ("PIC") in operational control of a flight
         operation from beginning to end and who controls the UA while in the
         air;

    · A 2.4GHz radio transmitterI controller operated by the PIC to control

         the UA while in flight;
    · A radio receiver receiving live video from the on-board camera and

         computer projects it altogether onto a screen for the PIC to view
         during flight;
    · A VO who is in constant radio communication with the PIC and in
         visual line of sight ("VLOS") who provides a second pair of eyes to
         visually track the UA while in flight.
    · A ground station that is marked by a fluorescent flag at a height of no
         more than 8 feet or 94". The ground station shall have visual contact
         with the UA or VO at all times.

         The requested exemption would support an application for a
commercial Certificate of Authorization to use the above-described HALO
System to support aerial photography and video primarily of real property
including but not limited to residential, commercial and agricultural
properties.

         The UA, powered by batteries, is smaller, lighter and more
maneuverable than larger aircraft running on combustible fuel, it operates at
altitudes below 400 AGL with no people onboard and will thereby reduce
current risk levels and enhances safety and diminishes the likelihood of death
or serious bodily injury.

         With a small payload and maximum flight time of only 10 minutes,
this offers little or no risk to national security.

         Low-level oblique photos and video from several angles are far more
effective than ground-based imagery for displaying the characteristics of
large, complex properties with several buildings and large trees. The
applicants in the past have chartered 2-seat full-sized helicopters for this
purpose, which have proven more costly than many potential clients have
been able to afford. The benefits of reduced cost and improved quality of
presentation from the UA will be valuable to and benefit many buyers and
sellers of real property.

         Additionally, we request that our system be utilized to benefit first
responders who might require assistance, including fire fighters, the police,
the sheriff, search and rescue, et al., while remaining subject to all limitations
cited in this application.

         The HALO System will be operated in the field with both a PIC and a
VO in accordance with FAA Policy N 8900.227, Section 14 "Operational
Requirements for UAS" and with the following Restrictions:

    (a) No flight will be made with a UA gross weight exceeding 55 pounds;

         EXEMPTION REQUESTS AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Halo Aviation, LLC, (petitioner) requests an exemption from the following regulations as well as
any additional regulations that may technically apply to the operation of the HALO System:

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates.
This part establishes the procedures for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate. The FAA
has indicated that relief is not necessary under 14 CFR Part 21 as statutory criteria established
in Section 333 of P.L. 112-95 in reference to 49 USC Section 44704, that the size, weight,
speed and limited operating area with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of
Transportation has determined that this type of aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333.

However, the petitioner wishes to be thorough and requests that the FAA be reminded that the
aircraft will not carry persons or property, will not carry fuel, and will only fly under strict
operational requirements. Combined with the UA's light-weight, being constructed primarily of
carbon fiber and plastic, we confirm that the UA will be at least as safe, if not safer, than a
conventionally certificated aircraft performing the same mission.

The parts for the UA will be obtained from the manufacturer or licensed representative of the
manufacturer and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b) Civil aircraft: Certifications required.
The regulation provides that an airworthiness certificate, with the registration number assigned
to the aircraft and a registration certificate must be aboard the aircraft. Additionally,
subparagraph (b) provides that the airworthiness certificate be "displayed at the cabin or cockpit
entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew."

At a maximum gross weight of 5.3 pounds, the UA is too small to carry documentation, does not
have an entrance, and is not capable of carrying passengers or crew. To obtain an equivalent
level of safety and meet the intent of 91.203, we propose that documents deemed appropriate
for this aircraft by the FAA will be co-located with the crew at the ground control station and
available for inspection upon request. In order to identify the aircraft, we propose that the
information found on airworthiness and registration certificates be permanently affixed to the
aircraft via placard containing the following information:

                    Property of: HALO AVIATION, LLC.
                    MFG: Horizon Hobby, Inc.

                    If found please contact: (541) 954-9434

14 CFR 45.29 Size of marks.
These regulations provide that each aircraft must display "N" and the aircraft's registration
number in letters at least 3 inches high.

                                                                                                                    Addendum Page 1 of 4
We propose to achieve an equivalent level of safety by including a placard on the top of the
aircraft, as shown above, where the PIC, VO and others in the vicinity of the aircraft while it is
preparing for launch will be able to see the designation. Additionally, we feel that the permanent
placard discussed in the previous paragraph will provide the aircraft's registration information at
the ground station. Finally, we will display at the ground station a high contrast flag or banner
that contains the words "Unmanned Aircraft Ground Station" in letters 3 inches high or greater.
Since the aircraft will operate within 3/4 NM of the ground station, the banner should be visible
to anyone that observes the aircraft and chooses to investigate its point of origin.

14 CFR 91.7 Civil aircraft airworthiness.
This regulation provides that (a) no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy
condition. And (b) the pilot in command of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether
that aircraft is in condition for safe flight. The pilot in command shall discontinue flight when
unairworthy mechanical, electrical, or structural conditions occur.

Petitioner understands that a UA is not issued an airworthiness certificate and understands that
the FAA requires the petitioner to comply with the UA operating documents prior to every flight
to determine if the UA is in an airworthy condition.

In accordance with Appendix () the PIC shall perform an airworthiness inspection prior to every
flight and shall terminate or discontinue a flight as soon as safely practicable upon the discovery
of an unairworthy condition which shall include mechanical, electrical or structural failures.

14 CFR 91.9 Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements.
This regulation provides that no person may operate an aircraft unless a current, approved flight
manual is in the aircraft. We assume that the intent of this requirement is to ensure that flight
manual information is available to the aircrew while operating the aircraft. We request an
exemption to this requirement since the aircraft is not only too small to carry documentation, the
documentation would not be available to the crew during flight operations.

To obtain an equivalent level of safety and meet the intent of 91.9, we propose that a current,
approved UA Flight Manual (Appendix A) must be available to the crew at the ground station
anytime the aircraft is in, or preparing for, flight.

14 CFR 61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in Command and 61.133
Commercial pilot privileges and limitations.
The regulation provides that no person that holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in
command of an aircraft for compensation or hire. Subparagraph (b) allows a private pilot to act
as pilot in command of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if: (1) The
flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and (2) The aircraft does not carry
passengers or property for compensation or hire.

Our proposed operations require that the PIC must either:
     1. Hold a Commercial Pilot Certificate issued by the FAA, and have logged 25 hours of
          flight experience in this type of UA;
     2. Meet the requirements of 8900.227 paragraph 16(c)(2)(c) "Operations without a pilot
          certificate" in which the PIC is required to complete "FAA private pilot ground instruction"
          and pass "the FAA Private Pilot written examination." Since there are currently no
          means available for the pilot of a UAS to gain the experience in an equivalent category
          and class in order to apply for a commercial pilot's license, we propose to generate an
          equivalent level of safety by requiring our pilots to complete, at a minimum, FAA private

                                                                                                                    Addendum Page 2 of 4
          pilot ground instruction and pass the FAA Private Pilot written examination in addition to
          completing and demonstrating proficiency of operation according to petitioner's
          guidelines and instructions set by the manufacturer. Since the aircraft cannot carry
          passengers or property, we feel we meet the intent of 61.113 Subparagraph (b) even
          though the intent of this application is to conduct a business.

14 CFR 91.109 Flight Instruction; Simulated instrument flight and certain flight tests.
The regulation states that "No person may operate a civil aircraft that is being used for flight
instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls."

The HALO System ground-based control station consists of a small hand-held radio transmitter
and while it does not offer a second set of "controls", both the student and instructor can, and
will, operate the single set of controls simultaneously. With both student and instructor having
"hands-on" the controls during flight, we feel that this technique meets the intent 91.109 and
provides an equivalent level of safety.

14 CFR 91.119 Minimum safe altitudes General.
The regulation states that over sparsely populated areas the aircraft cannot be operated closer
than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. Since the aircraft will be operating at
a maximum of 400 feet AGL, we cannot comply with this requirement.

In order to provide an equivalent level of safety we will only fly over private property with a size
of at least two acres with the permission of the owner of the property flown over. The aircraft
will not be operated over congested areas or over any open air assembly of persons. The
property owner will be briefed on the expected route of flight and the associated risks to persons
and property on the ground. The property owner will have read and reviewed a consent and
release form provided by the petitioner. The aircraft will be operated at a low altitude allowing, if
a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the
surface. Therefore we maintain that due to the small size of the UA, the hazard to persons,
vehicles and structures is minimal compared to manned aircraft, which should be considered in
granting the exemption.

14 CFR 91.121 Altimeter settings.
The regulation requires that aircraft shall maintain cruising altitudes by reference to an altimeter
setting available within 100 NM of the aircraft.

The UA will always fly below 400 feet AGL and will not need to maintain cruising altitudes in
order to prevent conflict with other aircraft. An Above Ground Level altimeter measurement
above the takeoff point is transmitted via radio from the UA on-board computer to the display
screen held by the PIC, providing a constantly updated AGL readout.

14 CFR 91.151 Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.
The regulation provides that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under day-VFR
conditions unless there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and to fly after
that for at least 30 minutes.

We feel the intention of this paragraph is to provide an energy reserve as a safety buffer for
delays to landing. The UA is battery operated and the maximum duration of flight from a single
battery charge is 10 minutes with a 20% reserve. Since the aircraft will never fly more than 3/4
NM from the point of intended landing, a full battery charge at launch will ensure that we meet

                                                                                                                    Addendum Page 3 of 4
the reserve energy requirement of this paragraph. We request an exemption to the word "fuel"
and ask for an equivalent interpretation with the word "energy".
14 CFR Subpart E (91.401 - 91.417)- Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Alterations.
The regulation provides that the operator is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft in
an airworthy condition, including compliance with part 39 and 43. Paragraphs 91.407 and
91.409 require that the aircraft be "approved for return to service by a person authorized under
43.7" after maintenance and inspection.
It is our intention that the PIC perform maintenance and inspection of the aircraft and "be
authorized to approve the aircraft for return to service." As provided in the Pre-Flight Checklist
in Appendix A, the PIC will ensure that the aircraft is in an airworthy condition prior to every
flight and in addition conduct detailed inspections after every two hours of flight. Maintenance
performed by the PIC is limited to repairing small cracks, replacing a propeller, checking
electrical connections and updating software and firmware for the on-board computer. All other
maintenance will be performed by the manufacturer or their designated repair facility. The PIC
will document work performed in accordance with 91.417. We feel that due to the size,
construction, and simplicity of the aircraft, the PIC can ensure an equivalent level of safety.
8900.227 Paragraph 16(c)(4) PIC Medical, and Paragraph 16(e)(1) Observer Medical.
This policy provides that both the PIC and VO must have a valid FAA second-class medical
certificate issued under part 67 in order to perform as a pilot or observer.
The UA maximum gross weight is 24 ounces, it is constructed of carbon fiber and plastic and
the PIC is not on board. Both the PIC and the VO are required to be in VLOS. Given the
unlikely event that both the PIC and VO become medically incapacitated while the aircraft is in
flight, the UA will return autonomously to the site of launching and land without crew
intervention. Therefore, requiring the PIC and VO to meet the same medical requirements as a
commercial pilot carrying passengers in a large aircraft is an unnecessary burden.
We propose that the minimum medical requirements for the PIC and VO be vision corrected to
20/20 and a valid, state issued driver's license. The 20/20 vision requirement will ensure that
the PIC and VO can see and avoid air traffic; a licensed driver is medically qualified to operate a
much larger vehicle.

                                                                                                                    Addendum Page 4 of 4

 1. Charge only batteries that are cool to the touch and are not damaged. lookat the battery to make sure it is not damaged e.g., swollen, bent, broken or punctured.
 2.Atlach the input cord ofthe charger to an appropriate power supply, such as a 12V battery or 12V DC power supply.
 3. When the U-Po charger has been correctly powered up, there will be an approximate 3-second delay, 1hen an audible "beep" and 1he green (ready) LED will flash.
 4.Tum the control on the Amps selector so the arrow points to 1he charging rate required for 1he battery (the 2200mAil U-Po battery will charge at 2.0 amps).

   DO NOT change 1he charge rate once the battery begins charging.
 5. Move the cell selector switch to 3-cell for your battery.
 6. Connect the balancing lead of the battery to 1he 3-cell (4 pin) charger port and press the Start button to begin battery charging.
 7.The green and red LEOs may flash during the charging process when the charger is balancing cells. Balancing prolongs 1he life of 1he battery.
 8.When the battery is fully charged, a beep will sound for about 3 seconds and 1he green LED will shine continuously. Attempting to charge an over-discharged

   battery will cause the charger to repeatedly flash and beep, indicating an error has occurred.
 9. Always unplug the battery from 1he charger immediately upon completion of charging.

Lh, CAUTION: overcharging a battery can cause afire.

 NOTICE: If using a battery o1her than the included U-Po battery, refer to your battery manufacturer's instructions forcharging.

Binding

· If you purchased the ready-to-fly (RTF) model, the transmitter is bound to the model at the factory. If for any reason the model needs to be re-bound, follow the
  directions for the Bind-N-Fly® (BNF) version below.

BNF To bind or re-bind your 350 OX to your chosen DSM2/DSMX transmitter, please follow the directions below aiQng with the binding. instructions

 BIND-N-R.V" included With YOUr transmitter:

                            The Binding Process                              Entering Bind Mode                          Mode2shown

1.With the transmitter and quadcopter powered off, connect the battery        F Bind switch
  to the 350 OX.                                                                        (Trainer switch)

2. With the 350 OX on a level surtace, turn on the power switch and allow
  the quadcopter to initialize.                                                                             Normal Bind

3.Wait until the blue LED on the quadcopter flashes rapidly, signaling the
  quadcopter is initialized and ready to bind.

4. Ensure throttle is in the low position and throtHe trim is at neutral.

5. Hold the control sticks in the desired bind position (see illustrations)
  and press/pull the bind button/switch, then power on the transmitter.

6. Refer to the Flying LED Codes table to ensure the aircraft is bound
  correctly.

IMPORTANT: Do not attempt to bind with more than one bind code.
Binding with more than one bind code will only allow the aircraft to
bind normally.

Unless binding with a bind code, the elevator and aileron inputs Onclud-
ing trim) must be neutral during binding.lf you are attempting a normal
bind with any input other than neutral, the aircraft will emit a constant,
rapid beeping sound.

If your 350 QX emits a constant beeping sound after binding                                                              Roll left

In the event you cannot find an input that stops the tones:

1. Apply 1 click of elevator trim in either direction and then slowly
   move the aileron stick ctose to center.

2. Continue to add 1 click at atime of elevator trim, up to 5 trim steps
   off center up or down, and move the aileron stick until you find the
   point that makes the tones stop.

3. Add aileron trim in the direction you moved the stick to make the
   tones stop.

        · When this feature is activated, the 350 ax will

            fly back to its assigned home location and

              land. After landing, the motors may take up to
              5 seconds to dlsarm.lf the motors take more

            than 20+ seconds to disarm, perform the

              Pressure Sensor Galibration.

   · To restart the props after landing in Return Home,
     fully lower the throttle and ensure the throttle trim is
     neutral,then quickly move the rudder stick fully left
     and then fully right

  4,. CAUTION:The 350 axwill not recognize the

 used. Activating Return Home may cause the 350 ax

 to fly directly over 1he pilot ifthe aircraftwas 11own to
 aposition behind where 1he.pilot was l$llding when
 the home position was established.

After Your Flight
 1. Tum off the power switch on the 350 QX.

 2. Tum off the power to your transmitter.
 3. Unplug and remove the battery from the 350 OX.

  A CAUTION: Always disconnect the IJcPo bat-

 ~ teryfrom the aircraftwhen not flying to avoid
 over·discharging the. battery. Batteries discharged.to a
 voltage belowthe lowest approved volt!ge may become
 damaged,resulting in loss of performance and potential
 fire when batteries are charged.

Location alert

 The motors will Beep under the following conditions:
   · Atanytimethe props stop spinning afterthey have
      been initialized.

   · After 30 seconds of no throttle input (waiting armed
      on the ground).

 This will alertthe pilot to the location of the aircraft if it
 lands in a location With low visibility.
 Beeping will continue until the battery can no longer

 supply enough power to the motors.

 If the quadcopter crash lands and one or more motors
 are stopped by an impact, the quadcopter enters
 emergency mode. The LED will flash whHe and the
  motors will beep loudly.
