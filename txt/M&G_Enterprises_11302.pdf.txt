                                                          Exemption No. 11302
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-1032

Mr. Mark Pickens
M&G Enterprises
645 Wildwood Trace
Winchester, TN 37398

Dear Mr. Pickens:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated December 9, 2014, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of M&G Enterprises (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct video filming and photography; inspection of land, residential, commercial, and
industrial structures and property; and training.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, M&G Enterprises is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, M&G Enterprises is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
    as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
       documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

Re: Petition of M&G Enterprises for an Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA
Modernization and Reform Act of 2012

Dear Gentlemen:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012
("Reform Act") and 14 C.P.R. Part 11, M&G Enterprises hereby applies for an
exemption from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") identified below, to
allow commercial operations of small unmanned aerial vehicles.

This exemption is made based on information outlined in this petition, as well as the
accompanying DJI Phantom 2 Operators Manual (Appendix B) and the M&G Enterprises
Operational Limitations (Appendix C). The DJI Phantom 2 UAS was selected because it
has a proven capability for controlled flight as well as a gyro stabilized flight mode, GPS
aided navigation, a compass, blinking LED's on the bottom, a failsafe mode for returning
home, and prop guards. These devices are offered for general sale around the world and
have often been used as Model Aircraft in the USA.

Specifically, the UAS is:

  A lightweight (< 7.0 lb gross weight with all on-board equipment), battery operated 4-
  motor rotorcraft in the form of a quadcopter that takes off and lands vertically,
  manufactured by DJI, Model Phantom 2 , with the following equipment:

     An on-board flight computer with GPS navigation and location ability that
         receives signals for flight controls from a ground-based
         transmitter/controller;

     An on-board camera capable of capturing imagery in the form of full color, high
         definition still photos and video;

     An on-board telemetry system that delivers flight data from the on-board flight
         computer to the on-board radio transmitter including altitude AGL, horizontal
         and vertical speed, compass direction of flight and direction back to its launch
         site;

     A 600mW, 5.8GHz on-board radio transmitter that transmits live video from the
         on-board camera plus all the flight data from the telemetry system described
         above;
   The Ground Station Includes:

     A Pilot in Command (PIC) in operational control of a flight operation from
        beginning to end and who controls the UAS while in the air;

     A 100mW, 2.4GHz radio transmitter/controller operated by the PIC to control
        the UAS while in flight;

     A radio receiver receiving live video and flight data from the on-board
        camera and computer projects it all together onto a screen for the PIC to
        view during flight;

     A Visual Observer (VO) is a person who provides a second pair of eyes to
        visually track the UAS while in flight.

Proposed Operations

     M&G Enterprises intends to use UAS in three general areas. First, M&G Enterprises seeks an
     exemption to perform video filming and photographing by air for public and private use.
     Second, it will employ UAS's to inspect land, residential commercial and industrial structures
     and property. Third, M&G Enterprises seeks permission to use UAS to offer training to
     persons, from both private and public entities, which are interested in the safe operation of
     UAS.

     Specifically, M&G Enterprises will use UASs which are equipped with cameras and sensors,
     in order to engage in the following commercial activities:

            (a) Video filming by air and photographing for public and private purposes, including:
            television, cinematography, advertising, promotions, public or news mass events.

            (b) Video filming by air and photographing to support professional operations in
            engineering, land surveying, architecture, real estate and other related professional
            activities.

            (c) Inspections by air of agricultural areas.

            (d) Inspections by air of infrastructure such as bridges, highways, electrical installations,
            dams, aqueducts, photovoltaic power stations, wind farms and pipes. These inspections
            will only be done under contract with the owners or with any local government authority.

            (e) Inspection by air of land and residential, commercial and industrial structures, only
            under contract with the owners or with any local government authority.

            (f) Inspections by air to detect sources of pollution and gas emissions, under contract
            with the owners in the area or with any local government authority.

            (g) Support provided to search and rescue operations and reconnaissance in cases of need,
            emergency or natural disasters and only when government authorities have requested it
            by contract or donation.
            (h) M&G Enterprises is passionate about offering training to persons, private and public
            entities, which are interested in the safe use of UASs, for purposes of enhancing the skills
            and safety controls which make the NAS safer and for the protection of persons and
            property.

 Relevant Statutory Authority

     This Petition for Exemption is submitted pursuant to Section 333(a) through (c) of the FAA
     Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ("Reform Act"). Congress has directed the FAA "to
     safely accelerate the integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace
     system." Pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act, the FAA Administrator is to permit
     unmanned aircraft systems to operate in the National Air Space ("NAS") where it is safe to do
     so based on the following considerations:

                   · The UAS's size, weight, speed and operational capability;

                   · Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and

                   · Operation of the UAS within the visual line of sight of the operator.

     Additionally, the FAA Administrator has general authority to grant exemptions from the
     agency's safety regulations and minimum standards when the Administrator decides a
     requested exemption is in the public interest. See 49 U.S.C. § 106(f) (defining the authority of
     the Administrator); 49 U.S.C. § 44701(f) (permitting exemptions from§§ 44701(a), (b) and§§
     44702-44716,et seq.). A party requesting an exemption must explain the reasons why the
     exemption: (1) would benefit the public as a whole, and (2) would not adversely affect safety
     (or how it would provide a level of safety at least equal to the existing rules). See 14 C.F.R. §
     11.81 (petitions for exemption).

M&G Enterprises Proposed UAS Operations Meet the Requirements of Section 333 of the
     Reform Act

     M&G Enterprises proposed operations in this Petition for Exemption qualify for expedited
     approval pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act as each of the statutory criteria and
     relevant factors are satisfied.

Approval is Warranted Based on the UAS Size, Weight, Speed, and Operational Capability

   M&G Enterprises will employ the DJI Phantom 2 quadcopters for the operations specified in
   this Petition for exemption. The Phantom 2 UASs have a maximum take-off weight of less than
   7 pounds, the flight speed will not exceed 35 miles per hour, and it will not be flown in
   controlled airspace or at an altitude that exceeds 400 feet AGL. All flights will be flown in such
   a way that they can be safely terminated with a reserve battery power of 25% of the battery's
   maximum charge. The DJI Phantom 2 UAS do not carry any flammable propellant or fuel. The
   Phantom 2 UAS also has an integrated GPS system that calculates the UAS's position and
   height and relays that information via a secure connection to the operator. Additionally, the
   Phantom 2 UAS contain a failsafe mode if its connection to the remote control is lost, and
   this system permits the UAS to return to a predetermined location and land without injury
   or damage. For additional safety, the Phantom 2 will be retrofitted with prop guards.

Approval is Warranted Based on the Operational Restrictions Set Forth in the Operations
Manual.

   The M&G Enterprises Operations Limitations and the DJI's operators manual contain all of the
   procedures and limitations necessary to successfully perform the operations specified in this
   Petition for Exemption. (Appendices B &C).

Public Interest

   The public interest will be served by granting M&G Enterprises Petition for Exemption.
   Congress has established a national policy that favors early integration of UASs into the NAS
   in controlled, safe working environments such as those proposed in this Petition. In addition,
   the public also has an interest in reducing the hazards associated with alternate methods of
   conducting similar operations. Currently operations are conducted using teams that physically
   climb onto structures using ladders, using low flying helicopters or aircraft, or simply not
   available by traditional means. By using UAS, exposure to physical hazards will be reduced
   of conducting the operation while remaining safely on the ground.

   Additionally, M&G Enterprise intended uses for the UAS's have identifiable safety benefits that
   include reducing the danger and emissions associated with full size helicopters, UAS have no
   fuel to ignite or explode, no crew, adds a greater degree of flexibility, which supplements the
   current capabilities offered by manned aircraft, and public interest for a ground impact for of a
   small lightweight UAS is further minimized from an ecological and safety standpoint.

Federal Register Summary

   Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
   Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

   M&G Enterprises seeks an exemption from the following rules:

   Parts 21; §§ 45.23(b); 27; 61.113(a) and (b); 61.3; 91.7(a); 91.9(b)(2); 91.103; 91.109; 91.119;
   91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a) and (b); 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(2); and 91.417(a) and
   (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).

   The exemption will enhance safety by reducing risk to the general public and property
   owners from the substantial hazards associated with performing equivalent work with
   conventional aircraft, rotorcraft, or other methods.

Conclusion

   M&G Enterprises Petition for Exemption satisfies the criteria articulated in Section
   333 of the Reform Act of 2012 including weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to
   airports and populated areas, operation within visual line of sight and national security.
   Additionally, the Petition provides more than adequate justification for the grant of the requested
   exemptions to permit M&G Enterprises to operate the selected UAS for the operations specified
   herein.

   Granting the exemption will benefit the public interest as a whole in several ways, including (1)
   significantly improving safety and reducing risk by alleviating human exposure to danger, and
   (2) improving the quality of services and decreasing operating costs compared with
   conventional flight operations.

                                             Appendix A

 The regulations from which the exemption is requested are listed below. Beside each
 regulation number is the page of the attached Appendix A upon which each may be
 found together with our proposed equivalent level of safety for each regulation:

 Parts 21,§§ 45.23(b); 27, 61.113(a) and (b) 61.3; 91.7(a); 91.9(b)(2); 91.103; 91.109; 91.119;
 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a) and (b); 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(2); and 91.417(a) and
 (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).

Exemptions Requested

 The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This
 statutory authority, by its terms, includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under§
 40101 of the Act, including UASs, from its safety regulations and minimum standards when
 the Administrator decides a requested exemption is in the public interest.

 M&G Enterprises seeks an exemption from several interrelated provisions of 14 C.F.R. Parts 21,
 27, 45, 61 and 91 for purposes of conducting the requested operations using a UAS. Listed below
 are the specific sections of 14 C.F.R. for which exemption is sought:

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H - Airworthiness Certificates

 The FAA has stated that no exemption is needed from this section if a finding is made
 under the Reform Act that the UAS selected provides an equivalent level of safety when
 compared to aircraft normally used for the same application. (Regulatory Docket No. FAA-
 2014-0352). These criteria are met, and therefore no exemption is needed.
       Equivalent Level of Safety

     The UAS selected by M&G Enterprises is safe when taking into account their size, weight, speed,
     and operational capability. T he UAS weigh less than 7 pounds and will be flown at less than 35
     miles per hour and completely outside controlled airspace. Additionally, the UAS carry neither
     pilots nor passengers, carry no explosive materials and or flammable liquid fuels, and operate
     exclusively within the parameters stated in the Operator's Manual and Operations Limitations.

     Operations under this exemption will be closely controlled and monitored by the operator and will
     be conducted in compliance with local public safety requirements, to provide security for the area
     of operation. M&G Enterprises will also provide the FAA with advance notice of all operations
     via NOTAMS and coordination with the local FSDO. In all cases, the UAS operated under the
     proposed conditions, will be at least as safe as, or safer than conventional rotorcraft operating with
     an airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions of the proposed UAS
     operations.

 14 C.F.R. Part 27 Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Rotorcraft

     14 C.P.R. Part 27 sets forth the procedural requirements for airworthiness certification of normal
     category rotorcraft. To the extent the M&G Enterprises UAS would otherwise require certification
     under Part 27, we seek an exemption from Part 27's airworthiness standards for the same reasons
     identified in the request for exemption from 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H.

 14 C.F.R. §§45.23(b), Display of marks; general

     These regulations provide that each aircraft must display "N" and the aircraft's registration number
     in letters at least 2 inches high. Additionally, the aircraft must display the word
     "EXPERIMENTAL" in letters at least 2 inches high near the entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or
     pilot station. The UAS does not have an entrance in which the word "EXPERIMENTAL" can be
     placed, and may not have a registration number assigned to it by the FAA.

     M&G Enterprises proposes to achieve an equivalent level of safety by including the word
     "EXPERIMENTAL" as large as practicable on the top of the aircraft, where the PIC, VO and
     others in the vicinity of the aircraft while it is preparing for launch will be able to see the
     designation. Finally, the ground station will display a high contrast flag or banner that contains
     the words "Unmanned Aircraft Ground Station" in letters 3 inches high or greater. Since the
     aircraft will operate within 3/4 NM of the ground station, the banner should be visible to anyone
     that observes the aircraft and chooses to investigate its point of origin.

     In a previous Grant of Exemption, Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0352, the FAA determined
     that exemption from these requirements was warranted provided that the aircraft "have
     identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 C.F.R part 45, Subpart C if the
     markings are as large as practicable."

14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b); 61.3 (c,2-v): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations, Medical
Certificate
 In addition, M&G Enterprises seeks exemption from 14 C.F.R § 61.113, which restricts private
 pilot certificate holders from flying aircraft for compensation or hire, and which would also
 require a second class medical certificate. The purpose of this section is to ensure the skill and
 competency of any PIC where the aircraft is carrying passengers or cargo for hire. In this case,
 while the UAS will be operated as part of a commercial operation, it carries neither passengers
 nor cargo. In the Grant of Exemption in FAA Docket No. FAA-2014-0352, the FAA determined
 that the unique characteristics of UAS operation outside of controlled airspace did not warrant
 the additional cost and restrictions attendant with requiring the PIC to have a commercial pilot
 certificate and class II medical certificate. Additionally, instead of having a second or third class
 medical, we suggest that the PIC exercise the privileges similar to that of a sport pilot, requiring
 only a valid US driver's license.

 Safety Mitigation

 Petitioner seeks to ensure safe operation by ensuring that any PIC is thoroughly versed in
 airspace and communication issues pertaining to all aircraft operators but also in the unique
 aspects of UAS flight. The owners of M&G Enterprises have commercial pilot's license,
 however, the experience obtained beyond a private pilot certificate in pursuit of a commercial
 pilot certificate in manned flight does not necessarily aid a pilot in the operational environment
 proposed. To that end, M&G Enterprises will require a PIC to have a minimum of a private
 pilot's license and adhere to the flight limitations listed in Appendix C.

 We find that the combination of aeronautical knowledge, UAS airmanship skills, and
 verification through remaining current is a sufficient method to evaluate a pilot's qualifications,
 given that operations will be conducted within the limitations outlined in this petition.

14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

 M&G Enterprises seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a), which requires that a civil
 aircraft be in airworthy condition to be operated. The FAA has stated (Regulatory Docket No.
 FAA-2014-0352) that no exemption is required to the extent that the requirements of Part 21 are
 waived or found inapplicable.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b)(2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft

 Given its size, configuration, and load capacity, the Phantom 2 has no ability to carry such a
 manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is simply
 no room or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.

 Safety Mitigation

 The safety related purpose of this manual requirement can be equally satisfied by maintaining
 the Phantom 2 Manual at the ground control point where the pilot flying the Phantom 2 will
 have immediate access to it. Accordingly, we request an exemption from § 91.9(b) (2)'s flight
 manual requirements, on the condition that the Phantom 2 flight manual be available at the
 control point during each operation.
14 C.F.R. § 91.103: Preflight Action

   M&G Enterprises seeks an exemption from 14 C.P.R.§ 91.103, which requires a PIC to become
   familiar with specific information before each flight, including information contained in the FAA-
   approved Flight Manual on board the aircraft. While the PIC will be familiar with all information
   necessary to safely conduct the flight, an exemption is requested to the extent that an FAA-
   approved Flight manual is required.

   Safety Mitigation

   An equivalent level of safety will be provided by following the Aircraft Operations Manual and
   flight manual provided by the manufacturer. The PIC will take all required preflight actions-
   including performing all required checklists and reviewing weather, flight requirements, battery
   charge, landing and takeoff distance, aircraft performance data, and contingency landing areas-
   before initiation of flight. The Operators Manual and Operational Limitations will be kept at the
   ground station with the operator at all times.

14 C.F.R. § 91.109(a): Flight Instruction

   M&G Enterprises seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.109(a), which provides that "no
   person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that is being used for flight
   instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls." UAS and remotely piloted
   aircraft, by their design, do not have functional dual controls. Instead, flight control is
   accomplished through the use of a device that communicates with the aircraft via radio
   communications.

 Safety Mitigation

   Given the size and speed of the UAS employed by M&G Enterprises, an equivalent level of safe
   training can still be performed without dual controls because no pilot or passengers are aboard the
   UAS, and all persons will be a safe distance away in the event that the UAS encounters any difficulties
   during flight instruction. In addition, we will conduct flight training at our Research and Development
   test sites, which are located on its own property. These training flights will be conducted in a sterile
   area and will otherwise comply with the provisions in the Operator's Manual for flights at the R&D
   facility. The FAA has stated (Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0352) that no exemption is required.

14 C.F.R. § 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

   M&G Enterprises requests an exemption from the minimum safe altitude requirements of 14
   C.F.R. § 91.119. Section 91.119 prescribes the minimum safe altitudes under which aircraft may
   not operate, including 500 feet above the surface and away from any person, vessel, vehicle, or
   structure in non-congested areas. See 14 C.F.R. § 91.119(c). Section 91.119(d) allows for a
   helicopter to operate at less than those minimum altitudes when it can be operated "without
   hazard to persons or property on the surface," provided that "each person operating the helicopter
   complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA."
   Safety Mitigation

   Compared to flight operations with rotorcraft weighing far more than the maximum weights
   proposed herein, and given the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated with these
   operations is far less than those that presently exist with conventional aircraft. An equivalent
   level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, and speed of the UAS, as well as the
   location where it is operated. In order to avoid any risk to aircraft, flight operations will be
   restricted to 400' AGL or below.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121: Altimeter Settings

   This petition seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.121, which requires a person operating an
   aircraft to maintain cruising altitude or flight level by reference to an altimeter that is set to the
   elevation of the departure airport or barometric pressure. An exemption is required to the extent
   that the UAS do not have a barometric altimeter, but rather a GPS altitude read out.

   Safety Mitigation

   The FAA has stated that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved if the UAS will be operated at
   400' AGL or below and within visual line-of-sight in addition to GPS based altitude information
   relayed in real time to the operator. See Grant of Exemption to Astraeus Aerial, Docket No. FAA-
   2014-0352. As the attached Operations Manual indicates, the chosen UAS meets these requirements,
   and a zero altitude initiation point will be obtained prior to flight

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

   M&G Enterprises requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.15l(a)'s fuel requirements for
   flight in VFR conditions. Section 91.151 states:

     (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless (considering
              wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of
              intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed -

         (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or

         (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

   Here, the technological limitations on UAS battery power means that no meaningful flight
   operations can be conducted while still maintaining a 30 minute reserve. M&G Enterprises
   proposes that all flights comply with this requirement by mandating that the aircraft be safely
   landed with no less than 25% of battery life remaining.

   Safety Mitigation

   The FAA has stated that an equivalent level of safety is provided if the UAS flight is
   terminated with at least 25% reserve battery power still available. See Grant of Exemption to
 Astraeus Aerial, Docket No. PAA-2014-0352. The Operations Manual conforms to this limit,
 providing an equivalent level of safety.

14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b) Civil aircraft: Certifications required.

 The regulation provides that an airworthiness certificate, with the registration number assigned to
 the aircraft and a registration certificate must be aboard the aircraft. Additionally, subparagraph
 (b) provides that the airworthiness certificate be "displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so
 that it is legible to passengers or crew."

 At a maximum gross weight of less than 7 pounds, the UAS is too small to carry documentation, does
 not have an entrance, and is not capable of carrying passengers or crew. To obtain an equivalent level
 of safety and meet the intent of 91.203, we propose that documents deemed appropriate for this aircraft
 by the FAA will be co-located with the crew at the ground control station and available for inspection
 upon request. The FAA has stated (Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0352) that no exemption is
 required.

14 C.F.R. 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(2); and 91.417(a) and (b) Maintenance
Required

 M&G Enterprises seeks an exemption from the maintenance inspection requirements contained in
 14 C.P.R.§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(2); 91.417(a) and (b). These regulations specify
 maintenance and inspection standards in reference to 14 C.P.R. Part 43. See, e.g., 14 C.P.R. §
 91.405(a) (stating that each owner or operator of an aircraft "[s]hall have the aircraft inspected as
 prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections ...have discrepancies
 repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter"). An exemption from these regulations is needed
 because Part 43 and these sections only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, which
 the UASs will not have.

 Safety Mitigation

 An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because maintenance and inspections will be
 performed in accordance with the Operators Manual. As provided in the Operators Manual,
 flights will not be conducted unless a flight operations checklist is performed that includes all of
 the aircraft's components.

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote control and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control system

connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more
 information.

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

 1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

 2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

 3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to

(Mode 2)                      The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                              Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                              Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                              The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                              altitude if the sticks are centered.
                              Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                              position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                              suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                              prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                              elevation changes.
                                      The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder.
                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                      clock-wise.
                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                      forward.
                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                      stick is centered.
                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                      faster flight velocity.
                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                      centered.
                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in
                                      a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight
                                      velocity.

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.
5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at
its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

       magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement
       underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.
6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.
           4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote control and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).
          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

                     A BC D

                                                                              Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote control.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Control Operation> for

      more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
           4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote control is lost. The flight control system
will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote control and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote control is powered off.
2 The remote control is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must have

        been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote control.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote control and the aircraft, essentially reducing

        the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote control.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.
Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as
the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being
able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures

1 Record Home Point.                       2 Flying.                                          3 Remote controller signal lost.

                                           LED Flight Indicator Figure 6-2

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
        will descend automatically.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
control from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position as
a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks on
the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:

1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is
        recorded last time.

2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

                      distance will be displayed as  D  if using iOSD module.

control               regain control. If remote control's signal is

                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.
6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.

              2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may
                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,

                  make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.

                                    Operational Limitations

1. The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) will weigh less than 7 pounds, including energy source(s)
    and equipment.

2. The UAS will not be flown at a ground speed exceeding 35 MPH.

3. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level (AGL), as
    indicated by the procedures specified in the operator's manual. All altitudes reported to ATC
    must be in feet AGL.

4. The UAS will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times. This
    requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than corrective
    lenses.

5. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS
    requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability. The VO and PIC must be
    able to communicate verbally at all times.

6. Prior to each flight the PIC will inspect the UAS to ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If
    the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the UAS is
    found to be in a condition for safe flight. The Ground Control Station, if utilized, will be
    included in the preflight inspection. All maintenance and alterations will be properly
    documented in the aircraft records.

7. If the UAS has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or flight
    characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, will undergo a functional test
    flight in accordance with the operator's manual. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight
    will make an entry in the UAS aircraft records of the flight. The requirements and procedures
    for a functional test flight and aircraft record entry will be added to the operator's manual.

8. The operator will follow the manufacturer's UAS aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements. When unavailable, aircraft
    maintenance/component/overhaul, replacement, and inspection/maintenance requirements will
    be established and identified in the operator's manual. At a minimum, requirements for the
    following will be included in the operator's manual:

    a. Actuators / Servos;

    b. Transmission (single rotor);
    c. Powerplant (motors);

    d. Propellers;

    e. Electronic speed controller;

    f. Batteries;

    g. Mechanical dynamic components (single rotor);

    h. Remote command and control;

    i. Ground control station (if used); and

    j. Any other components as determined by the operator;

9. The Pilot In Command (PIC) will possess at least a private pilot certificate and at least a valid
    driver's license. The PIC will also meet the flight review requirements specified in 14 CFR §
    61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

10. Prior to operations the PIC will have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b), a minimum of 200 flight cycles and 25 hours of total time as a UAS
    rotorcraft pilot and at least ten hours logged as a UAS pilot with a similar UAS type
    (single blade or multirotor). Prior documented flight experience that was obtained in
    compliance with applicable regulations may satisfy this requirement. Training,
    proficiency, and experience-building flights can also be conducted to accomplish the
    required flight cycles and flight time.

11. Prior to operations the PIC will have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b), a minimum of five hours as UAS pilot operating the make and model
    of UAS to be utilized for operations and three take-offs and three landings in the
    preceding 90 days. Training, proficiency, experience-building, and take-off and landing
    currency flights can be conducted to accomplish the required flight cycles and flight time.

12. The UAS may not be operated directly over any person, except authorized and consenting
    personnel, below an altitude that is hazardous to persons or property on the surface in the
    event of a UAS failure or emergency.

13 The operator will ensure that no persons are allowed within 500 feet of the area except those
    consenting. This provision may be reduced to no less than 200 feet if it would not adversely
    affect safety.

14. The UAS will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies in
    accordance with the operator's manual.

15. Each UAS operation will be completed within 30 minutes flight time or with 25% battery power
    remaining, whichever occurs first.

16. The operator will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations. This COA will also require the
    operator to request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but not
    less than 48 hours prior to the operation.

17. All aircraft operated in accordance will be identified by serial number, registered in
    accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N- Number) markings in
    accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be as large as practicable.

18. Each UAS operated will comply with all manufacturer Safety Bulletins.

19. The radio frequency spectrum used for operation and control of the UA will comply with the
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency
    requirements.

20. At least three days before scheduled flight, the operator will submit a written Plan of
    Activities to the local FSDO with jurisdiction over the area of proposed flight area. The 3-
    day notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:

          a. Dates and times for all flights;

          b. Name and phone number of the operator

          c. Make, model, and serial or N-number of UAS to be used;

          d. Name and certificate number of UAS PIC involved

          e. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners and/or
          local officials to conduct the flight operations; the list of those who gave permission
          must be made available to the inspector upon request;

          f. Signature of exemption-holder or representative; and

          g. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city, town,
          county, and/or state over which flights will be conducted and the altitudes essential to
          accomplish the operation.

22. The documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be available to the PIC at the
    Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
 23. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned operations and activities
      at all times (including, but not limited to, ultralight vehicles, parachute activities, parasailing
      activities, hang gliders, etc.).

24. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights under
