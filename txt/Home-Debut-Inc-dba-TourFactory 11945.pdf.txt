                                                           Exemption No. 11945
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1457

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Counsel for Home Debut, Inc., d/b/a TourFactory
35 East Wacker Drive
Suite 1875
Chicago, IL 60601

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Home Debut, Inc., d/b/a TourFactory (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct real estate photography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 1, DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2
Vision, and DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Home Debut, Inc., d/b/a TourFactory is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Home Debut, Inc., d/b/a TourFactory is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 1,
         DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2 Vision, and DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ when weighing
         less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will
         require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
                                                                                                            4

    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform
Act of 2012 and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of
14 C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform

Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of Home
Debut Inc., d/b/a TourFactory ("TourFactory"), an operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft
Systems ("UAs") used for real estate photography. Specifically, petitioner seeks an exemption
from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed in Appendices A and B to allow

commercial operation of its UAs, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the

conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA in a grant of this petition. This

request is substantially similar to other data collection petitions previously approved, and should

be considered under the expedited summary grant procedure. Additionally, this petition should

be eligible for the summary grant because of the voluntary altitude restriction to 200 feet above

ground level (AGL).

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the DJI
Phantom 1, Phantom 2, Phantom 2 Vision, and Phantom 2 Vision+ for real estate photography in
Class G airspace nationwide, or as otherwise prescribed by an Air Traffic Organization (ATO)
issued COA. The UA covered by this petition is a small battery-powered craft, weighing between
approximately 2.2 lbs. (1 kg.) and 2.74 lbs. (1.24 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload.
Operation of the UAs under the strict conditions proposed below will provide an equivalent level
of safety, as Congress intended, while still allowing commercial operations. Operations using
these UAs are far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing
aircraft that weigh thousands of pounds, carry highly flammable fuel, and operate in close
proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure, and people.

         Congress directed the FAA to consider seven factors in deciding whether to approve
Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to
airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight. In this case,
each factor supports the exemption request. In particular, the UA is small, and will operate at

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.27;
14 C.F.R. 45.29; 14 CFR 61.23(a) and (c); 14 CFR 61.101(e)(4) and (5) 14 CFR
61.113(a); 14 CFR 61.315(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R.
91.9(c); 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.105; 14 C.F.R. 91.109; 14 C.F.R.
91.113(b); 14 C.F.R. 91.119(c); 14 C.F.R. 91.121; 14 C.F.R. 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R.
91.203(a) and (b); 14 C.F.R. 215; 14 C.F.R. 91.403; 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a); 14 C.F.R.
91.407(a)(1); 14 C.F.R. 409(a)(1) and (a)(2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to
operate commercially a small unmanned aircraft system (UA) to operate
commercially a small unmanned aircraft system (UA) (2.74 lbs. or less).

    Approval of the exemption requested by petitioner will allow commercial operation
    of the DJI Phantom 1, Phantom 2, Phantom 2 Vision, and Phantom 2 Vision+ for real
    estate photography in Class G airspace nationwide, or as otherwise prescribed by an
    Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued COA. The requested exemption should be
    granted because operation of small UAs, weighing between approximately 2.2 lbs. (1
    kg.) and 2.74 lbs. (1.24 kg.) inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the strict
    conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety, while still
    allowing commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the exemption
    are far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing
    aircraft weighing thousands of pounds and carrying highly flammable fuel, and
    operating in close proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure, and people. The
    seven factors Congress directed the FAA to consider when approving Section 333
    exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to
    airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight ­ each
    support the request. In particular, the aircraft are small, and will operate at slow
    speeds, and close to the ground in order to more safely and efficiently conduct
    inspections that would otherwise involve a risk of death to the inspectors. The
    substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life, coupled with the low
    risk use of UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in favor of granting the
    exemption.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the characteristics of the
UAs are numbers 1, 5, 19, 20, 21, and 30 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or imposed
by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

B. The Crew

         The crew will consist of a pilot in command (PIC) and a visual observer (VO). The PIC
and VO will have been trained in operation of UA generally and received up-to-date information
on the UA to be operated pursuant to this grant. The PIC will have completed, at a minimum, 20
hours of UA flight training with this specific UA prior to operations, and will be required to
participate in annual training thereafter.

The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the training and
                                                 8
characteristics of the crew are numbers 6-10 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

C. Flight Conditions

         The UA will be used to take real estate photography nationwide. It will be flown in Class
G airspace under 200 feet above ground level ("AGL") and under controlled conditions over
property that is restricted as stated in Section 5 of Exhibit 1. Petitioner will work with the local
FSDO when planning operations. Petitioner will only operate its UA in visual meteorological
conditions (VMC). The UA will at all times be no less than 500 feet below and no less than
2,000 feet horizontally from a cloud, and petitioner will not conduct operations unless visibility
is at least 3 statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always make a safety assessment of
the risk of every operation, and will only operate when it is determined that no hazards are
present.

         Please refer to Exhibit 1 Section 5 for more information regarding flight conditions.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the flight conditions in
which the UA will be operated are numbers 27, 28, 29, and 34 in Section V below. Each has
been adopted or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption
petitions.

D. Flight Operations

         The purpose of every UA flight will be to safely, accurately, and efficiently take aerial
photography for real estate.

         Every UA flight will use at minimum a two person flight crew: a PIC and a VO. The
standard operational procedures that they will follow are set out in Exhibit 1. Please refer to the
following sections for information pertaining to operations:

         Section 5: Pre-Flight Safety Procedures
         Section 6: UAS Routine Inspection and Maintenance
         Section 7: In-Flight Safety Operations
         Section 8: Visual Observer Responsibilities
         Section 9: Emergencies

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 2, 3, 11-18, 22-24, 26, 32, 33, 35, and 36 in Section V below. Each has been accepted
or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

IV. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at
least equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory
structure. Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to
be bound when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A
contains a matrix connecting (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for
which it provides an equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333

                                                          9
exemption grants in which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety.

      Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national
security issue. Petitioner is willing to require its PICs to undergo a background check, including
the proposed Transportation Security Administration Vetting process, to ensure that no national
security threat is present. Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg.

1. The UAs will weigh between 2.2 lbs. (1 kg) and 2.74 lbs. (1.24 kg.).

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of commercial real estate photography.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of the PIC and VO.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 200 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in
    feet AGL.

5. The UA will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 30 knots.

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the UA pilot in command (PIC) and a
    visual observer (VO).

7. The PIC will have, at minimum, 20 hours of training on the UA to be operated under this
    grant before accepting commercial operations.

8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification
    criteria and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with
    how the UA will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency
    maneuvers and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and
    structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent
    with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). A record of the PIC training will be documented and made available
    upon request by the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during
    dedicated training sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all
    persons not essential for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC
    will operate the UA with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14
    CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

                                                         10
11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance
    has been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance
    and alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements,
    in accordance with the UA manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements set forth in the operating documents.
    Maintenance, inspection, alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts
    will be noted in the aircraft records, including total time in service, description of work
    accomplished, and the signature of the authorized person returning the UA to service. The
    authorized person will make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken
    against discrepancies discovered between inspections.

15. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will
    not be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight
    operations.

16. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions)
    there is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and land
    the UA with 25% battery power remaining.

17. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 25% battery
    reserve.

18. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

19. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will
    return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be
    recovered in accordance with the operating documents.

20. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

21. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
                                                         11
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow
    the procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating
    documents, it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request.
    If the petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the
    FAA granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant
    of exemption.

22. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents
    of the landowners over which flights will be conducted.

23. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or
    city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

24. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

25. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, and altitude
    level.

26. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a
    NOTAM as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport
    management will be made available to the Administrator upon request.

27. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally
    from, a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

28. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

29. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

30. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

                                                         12
31. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

32. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

33. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

    a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from
         the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
         nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
         nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
         will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

    b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
         such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
         present an undue hazard.

    c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
         undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

34. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's
    UA Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the
    National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web
    site: www.ntsb.gov.

VI. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur over private property with the landowner's/authorized agent's permission.
When the UA is being flown, the onboard cameras will be focused on the specific property and
thus turned so as to be facing away from any occupied structures that may be in the area to
minimize inadvertent video or still images of uninvolved persons. Please refer to Exhibit 1
Section 10: Privacy for more information regarding petitioner's privacy policy.

VII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety for real estate photography. The
enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact achieved using a UA with the specifications
described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UA operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of petitioner's UA in the

                                                         13
purposes of commercial real estate photography, pursuant to TourFactory's rules of operation.
The FAA has previously approved members of the DJI Phantom family for real estate
photography in Exemption Nos. 11191, 11195, 11271, 11295, 11300, and 11318.

         The small weight of the Phantom UA family, ranging from 2.2 lbs. to 2.74 lbs. (1 kg. to
1.24 kg.), is less than the size envisioned in Section 334(c)(2)(C) of the FAA Modernization and
Reform Act of 2012, which allows government agencies "to operate unmanned aircraft weighing
4.4 pounds or less, if operated ­

            i. within the line of sight of the operator;
           ii. less than 400 feet above the ground;
          iii. during daylight conditions;
          iv. within Class G airspace; and
           v. outside of 5 statute miles from any airport, heliport, seaplane base, spaceport, or

                  other location with aviation activities."
         Congress's determination that government agencies should be allowed to operate such
aircraft in these situations, with no further restrictions on location, population density, or pilot
experience and training, indicates that Congress did not believe that aircraft of this size and
weight warranted additional attention.

    B. Appendix B: TourFactory's argument for exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and
         (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a).

         TourFactory requests an exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and
(5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), so that the PIC of the UA will not be required to possess any pilot
license (sports, recreational, private or commercial). As the FAA and numerous other national
airspace regulators have recognized, UA operations conducted by persons who do not hold a
pilot's license can still achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned
aircraft with pilots holding any level of pilot's license.

         Although it recognizes that a pilot's license is unnecessary for safe UA operation, the
FAA has to date declined to allow grant exemptions under Section 333 that would permit
individuals who possess any pilot license (sports, recreational, private or commercial) to conduct
commercial UA operations. It has specified two reasons for declining to do so. First, it has stated
that it does not possess the authority under Section 333 to exempt individuals from the
requirement under 49 U.S.C. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman to
serve in the capacity for which the certificate was issued. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. Second,
the FAA has concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) security screening
required of all certified airmen meets the statutory requirement in Section 333 that operations not
pose a threat to national security. Exemption No. 11110 at 15.

         TourFactory respectfully requests that the FAA reconsider its position. There is no
dispute that it is unnecessary for an operator of a UA to go through the rigorous process of
becoming a certified pilot in order to safely operate a UA. In addition, the FAA does have the
authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement in 49 U.S.C. §44711to hold an airman
certificate for "serv[ing] in the capacity for which the certificate was issued." Indeed, it has
exercised that authority repeatedly in the Section 333 process. Finally, the FAA's security
concerns can be addressed by a variety of methods involving operator background checks to be
conducted by government agencies.

             1. The FAA and foreign regulators recognize that obtaining a manned aircraft
                  pilot license is unnecessary for safe operation of a UA.

         The FAA, like the other national airspace regulators that have considered the issue, has
concluded that UA operations conducted by persons who do not hold a pilot's license can still
achieve the equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned aircraft with pilots
holding any level of pilot's license. In its recent UAS NPRM, the FAA stated:

         "While these airman certification requirements are necessary for manned aircraft
         operations, they impose an unnecessary burden for many small UAS operations.
         This is because a person typically obtains a private or commercial pilot certificate
         by learning how to operate a manned aircraft. Much of that knowledge would not
         be applicable to small UAS operations because a small UAS is operated
         differently than manned aircraft. In addition, the knowledge currently necessary to
         obtain a private or commercial pilot certificate would not equip the certificate
         holder with the tools necessary to safely operate a small UAS... Thus, requiring
         persons wishing to operate a small UAS to obtain a private or commercial pilot
         certificate imposes the cost of certification on those persons, but does not result in
         a significant safety benefit because the process of obtaining the certificate does

                                                         18
         not equip those persons with the tools necessary to mitigate the public risk posed
         by small UAS operations." Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned
         Aircraft, 80 Fed. Reg. 9543 at 9550 (proposed Feb. 23, 2015 (to be codified at 14
         C.F.R. Parts 21, 43, 45, et al.).

         The FAA's conclusion that manned aircraft flying experience is unnecessary for the
operation of a UA is supported by research by the FAA and the Army Research Laboratory.
They demonstrate that UAs, even those much larger than the UAs proposed by TourFactory, can
be safely flown by non-certificated pilots with a small amount of training. For example, one
Army Research Laboratory study concluded:

         "[T]he specific motor skills needed to control the radio-controlled UAV would
         have to be learned by aviators independently of the motor skills learned in flying
         an aircraft. In particular, the somatic and visual cues that pilots use during aircraft
         landings would not be useful (and perhaps even counter-productive) for the
         different skill sets and perceptual viewpoint necessary for radio-controlled
         landings."1

         Additional research reports lend further support for the exclusion requested. For
example, a report sponsored by the FAA concluded that "We know that certain systems, like the
U.S. Army Hunter and Shadow systems, are successfully flown by pilots with no manned aircraft
experience."2

         In addition, foreign government airspace regulators that have examined the issue have
consistently recognized that the skills required to fly a manned aircraft are irrelevant to operating
a UA. For that reason, they have concluded that UA operators do not need to have a private or
commercial pilot's license. Canada, for example, does not require a pilot's license to operate a
UA. Transport Canada requires training of UA operators, but that training is limited to pilot
ground school and flight operation training on UAs, not manned aircraft.3 Moreover, Canada
allows this training to be "provided by other pilots, manufacturers, [UA] flight training
organizations or . . . self taught." 4

populated areas may change this assessment, indicating further research was needed to address
this concern, this concern is inapplicable as TourFactory's flights will not be in congested areas.

         Similarly, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recognized that
determining "Remote Pilot qualification requirements on the same basis as manned aircraft may
yield requirements that are too inflexible, too onerous and inappropriate for UAS operations."5
As a result, the CAA only requires UA operators to demonstrate UA operator competence.6
While there are a variety of ways to demonstrate competence, the most common is to complete a
course that will lead to a ground exam and flight test. Australia, too, requires only passage of a
UA-specific ground school program in lieu of a manned airman certificate.7 Finally, more than a
dozen countries, including Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, have adopted the
National UAS Certificate for Small Unmanned Aircraft (BNUC-S) Standard for UA pilot
certification.8 This standard results in a type-specific UA certificate and does not require the
operator to have a pilot's license. The process involves taking a short ground school course,
passing a ground school test and then passing a practical test on commercial operation of the
specific UA per the UA manufacturer's operations manual.

         All of this experience and evidence indicates that the proposed exemption will provide a
greater level of safety than operations under 14 C.F.R. §61.113. In this instance, the PICs will
have gone through training as described above in Section III B. This training and education is
focused on UAs generally, and in particular on the aircraft to be operated, rather than taking
additional time and risk to train on a manned aircraft, weighing several thousand pounds and
carrying highly flammable fuel.

         The FAA has concluded in the NPRM that such UA-specific training is more than
sufficient to provide an equivalent level of safety for UA operations. Sometime in the next 18-
24 months, that position will be enshrined in a valid regulation. However, in the meantime, the
FAA claims it lacks the authority to relax the requirement to possess a pilot certificate. As we
show in the next section, that position is both incorrect and contradicted by the FAA's recent
decisions.

         2. The FAA does have, and has already, exercised the authority to exempt
             petitioners from the airman certificate requirement.

         The FAA claims that it lacks authority to exempt UA operators from the requirement of
49 U.S. §44711 to hold an airman certificate authorizing the airman "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This claim is
inconsistent with both (i) the statutory language of that section and Section 333, and (ii)
numerous recent FAA decisions.

         The operative part of 49 USC §44711 provides that a "person may not . . . serve in any

capacity as an airman with respect to a civil aircraft, . . . used, or intended for use, in air
commerce -- (A) without an airman certificate authorizing the airman to serve in the capacity
for which the certificate was issued . . . " If the FAA's interpretation were correct, this language
would require that any person wishing to operate a UA for commercial operations have an
airman certificate authorizing the person to serve as an airman in commercial operations.

         However, in all of its recent grants of Section 333 petitions, the FAA has ­ without
explicitly acknowledging the fact - exempted commercial UA operators from the §44711(A)
requirement that they hold an airman certificate authorizing them "to serve in the capacity for
which the certificate was issued." It has done so by allowing them to operate UA so long as they
hold a private pilot's or sport pilot's authorization, even though such a certificate does not permit
commercial operations. Exemption No. 11062 at 15-18; Exemption No. 11110 at 14-16;
Exemption No. 11191 at 3-5; and Exemption No. 11229 at 3 and 8.

         The FAA argues that it cannot exempt petitioners from the requirements of §44711
because, while the specific language of Section 333 grants it limited statutory flexibility relative
to 49 U.S.C. §44704 for the purposes of airworthiness certification, Section 333 does not provide
flexibility relative to §44711 and other sections of Title 49. Exemption No. 11110 at 14. This
argument ignores the plain language of Section 333. The relevant language of Section 333 is:

         (a) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subtitle, and
         not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
         Transportation shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate
         safely in the national airspace system before completion of the plan and
         rulemaking required by section 332 of this Act or the guidance required by
         section 334 of this Act.

         (b) ASSESSMENT OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.--In making the
         determination under subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine, at a
         minimum--

         (1) which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size,
         weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas,
         and operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the
         national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security; and

         (2) whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
         certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for
         the operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1).

         (c) REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE OPERATION.--If the Secretary determines
         under this section that certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in
         the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the
         safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system.

         The language of Section 333(b) is permissive: it requires that the Secretary "determine,
at a minimum . . . whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the operation of
unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1)." Nothing in (b) precludes the

                                                         21
Secretary from determining whether or not a pilot's license is required for operation of a UA
identified under paragraph (b)(1).

         Indeed, the FAA has implicitly conceded the point by granting exemptions from the
requirement that commercial UA operators hold a commercial pilot certificate. From an
analytical standpoint, there is no difference between granting an exemption from the commercial
pilot's license requirement and granting an exemption from the private or sport pilot's license
requirement. Both are clearly exemptions from a specific statutory requirement in 49 U.S.C.
§44711. If the FAA has the statutory authority under Section 333(b) to do the former, it has the
same authority to do the latter.9

9 The FAA has not specifically identified the statutory provision that underpins its authority to
grant the exemptions from the commercial pilot's license requirement. Whether the statutory
basis is Section 333 or some other provision makes no difference. If there is a basis for a partial
exemption from in 49 U.S.C. § 44711, that basis also justifies an exemption from the entire
provision.

This product is an autopilot system designed for serious multi-rotor enthusiasts providing excellent self-leveling and
altitude holding, which completely takes the stress out of flying RC multi-rotors for both professional and hobby
applications. Despite the system having a built-in autopilot system and our efforts in making the operation of the
controller as safe as possible when the main power battery is connected, we strongly recommend users to remove
all propellers when calibrating and setting parameters. Make sure all connections are good, and keep children and
animals away during firmware upgrade, system calibration and parameter setup. DJI Innovations accepts no liability

Start & Stop Motor Knowledge

             (1) Both Immediately Mode and Intelligent Mode are available in the Assistant Software:
                     Advanced->Motor->Stop Type.

             (2) Stop Motor method is defaulted to Immediately Mode.
Please get to know well about this section before flying.
1 Start Motor: Pushing throttle stick before takeoff will not start the motors. You have to execute any one of

        following four Combination Stick Commands (CSC) to start the motors:

                                                  33

©2013 DJI Innovations. All Rights Reserved. 10 |
2 Stop Motor: We provide two options to stop motors in the assistant software: Immediately and Intelligent.
        (1) Immediately Mode: If you select this mode, in any control mode, once motors start and throttle stick is
                over 10%, motors will not stop immediately only when throttle stick is back under 10% the motors will
                stop. In this case, if you push the throttle stick over 10% within 5 seconds after motors stop, motors
                will re-start, CSC is not needed. If you don't push throttle stick after motors start in three seconds,
                motors will stop automatically.
        (2) Intelligent Mode: By using this mode, different control mode has different way of stopping motors. In
                Manual Mode, only executing CSC can stop motors. In ATTI. Mode or GPS ATTI. Mode, any one of
                following four cases will stop motors:
                a) You don't push throttle stick after motors start within three seconds;
                b) Executing CSC;
                c) Throttle stick under 10%, and after landing for more than 3 seconds.
                d) If the angle of multi-rotor is over 70°, and throttle stick under 10%.

Notes of Intelligent Mode

             (1) In ATTI. / GPS ATTI. Mode, it has landing judgment, which will stop motors.
             (2) Start motors in ATTI. / GPS ATTI. Mode, you have to execute CSC and then push throttle stick

                     over 10% in 3 seconds, otherwise motors will stop after 3 seconds.
             (3) During normal flight, only pull throttle stick under 10% will not stop motors in any control mode.
             (4) For safety reason, when the slope angle of multi-rotor is over 70° during the flight in ATTI. /

                     GPS ATTI. Mode (may be caused by collision, motor and ESC error or propeller broken down),
                     and throttle stick is under 10%, motors will stop automatically.

Notes of Intelligent Mode & Immediately Mode

          (1) If you choose the Immediately Mode, you should not pull throttle stick under 10% during flight,
                   because it will stop motors. If you do it accidentally, you should push the throttle stick over 10% in
                   5s to re-start motors.

          (2) DO NOT execute the CSC during normal flight without any reason, or it will stop motors at once.
          (1) If you choose the Intelligent mode, and the throttle stick is under 10%, this will trigger the landing

                   Procedure, in any control mode. In this judgment, pitch, roll and yaw controls are denied except
                   the throttle, but multi-rotor will still auto level.
          (2) In any control mode, DO NOT pull throttle stick under 10% during normal flight without any
                   reason.

          (1) Any of these two cut off types will only work properly if TX calibration is correct done.
          (2) In failed-safe, CSC is denied by the main controller, motors will hold their state.

Step1 Compass Calibration

Without GPS module, please skip this step. If you use with GPS module, follow step-by-step for calibration.

          (1) DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is magnetic interference, such as magnetite, car
                   park, and steel reinforcement under the ground.

          (2) DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration, such as keys or cell phones.
          (3) Compass module CANNOT work in the polar circle.

          (4) Compass Calibration is very important, otherwise the system will work abnormal.

Calibration Procedures

  1. Switch on the transmitter, and then power on autopilot system!

  2. Quickly switch the control mode switch from GPS Mode to Manual Mode and back to GPS Mode (or
          from GPS Mode to ATTI. Mode and back to GPS Mode) for more than 5 times, The LED indicator will
          turn on constantly yellow so that the aircraft is ready for the calibration.

  3. (Fig.1) Hold your Multi-rotor horizontal and rotate it around the gravitational force line (about 360o) until
          the LED changes to constant green, and then go to the next step.

  4. (Fig.2)Hold your Multi-rotor vertically and rotate it (its nose is downward) around the gravitational force
          line (about 360o) until the LED turns off, meaning the calibration is finished.

               Fig.1 Fig.2

5. If the calibration was successful, calibration mode will exit automatically. If the LED keeps flashing quickly
        Red, the calibration has failed. Switch the control mode switch one time to cancel the calibration, and
        then re-start from step 2.

1. When the GPS is abnormal, the Main controller will tell you by the LED blinking Red and Yellow

alternately (  ), disable the GPS Module, and automatically enter the aircraft into the

ATTI. Mode.

2. You don't need to rotate your multi-rotor on a precise horizontal or vertical surface, but keep at

least 45° difference between horizontal and vertical calibration.

3. If you keep having calibration failure, it might suggest that there is very strong magnetic

        interference around the GPS /Compass module, please avoid flying in this area.
4. When to do re-calibration
(1) The flight field is changed.
(2) When the multi-rotor mechanical setup has changed:
a) If the GPS/Compass module is re-positioned.
b) If electronic devices are added/removed/ re-positioned (Main Controller, servos, batteries, etc.).

c) When the mechanical structure of the multi-rotor is changed.

(3) If the flight direction appears to be shifting (meaning the multi-rotor doesn't "fly straight").

(4) The LED indicator often indicates abnormality blinking when the multi-rotor spins. (It is normal

     35for this to happen only occasionally)

Step2 Assembly Checking List

Please check each item, to make sure for safety.
             Any of the following mistakes will lead to a dangerous accident, double check all these items:
             (1) Rotation direction of motor is opposite
             (2) Infirm connection between the motor and the ESC
             (3) Wrong or infirm installation of Main controller
             (4) Wrong or infirm connection between the main controller and ESC.
             (5) Propeller installation mistake
             (6) Magnetization of the compass
             Make sure the following items are correct.
             (1) Make sure you have assembled your multi-rotor correctly.
             (2) Make sure you have done the configuration procedure correctly.
             (3) Make sure all connections are in good condition.
             (4) Make sure batteries are fully charged for your transmitter, autopilot system and all devices.

Step3 Before Flight

Carry out the following procedures (is based on Intelligent Mode of Motor Stop) to make sure all
configurations are correct. Refer to the Appendix->LED Description for more LED details.

1. Always switch on the transmitter first, then power on multi-rotor!

2. Keep the aircraft stationary until the system start and self-check has finished (                            ).

After that, the LED may blink Yellow 4 times quickly (     ). Start motor is disable during LED blinking

Yellow 4 times quickly (  ), as the system is warming up.

3. After the 4 times Yellow LED disappears, toggle the control mode switch on your transmitter to make sure it

is working properly. For example, LED blinks (           ), which means the system is in ATTI. Mode and the

GPS signal is worst Check it with LED indicator to specify the current working mode for MC. See following

table for details about LED indicator;

(1) There are Manual Mode and ATTI. Mode without a GPS/Compass module, no GPS signal status LED

indicator.

(2) After connecting to the GPS/Compass module, GPS ATTI. Mode is available, and GPS signal status

LED indicator is available.

             Control Mode LED Indicator                    GPS Signal Status LED Indicator

Manual Mode: NO LED                                        Signal is best (GPS satellites > 6) : NO LED

4. Keep the aircraft stationary, and then push both sticks to the left bottom or right bottom (shown as the
        following chart, defined as Combination Stick Commands (CSC)), to start the motors.

5. Release the yaw, roll and pitch sticks and keep them at the mid point, and the throttle stick under the mid
        point. Then check whether all propellers are rotating correctly.

6. Stop motors, power off the Multi-rotor.
7. Make sure all settings and configurations are correct and then you can take off you aircraft.

After power on, if abnormal LED Indicator occurs, please refer to the Abnormal LED instruction in the FAQ and
aids troubleshooting.

Step4 Flying Test

  1. Choose an open space without obstruction, tall buildings and crowds as flying filed. Place the aircraft 3
      meters away from you and others, to avoid accidental injury.

  2. If in GPS ATTI. Mode, place the aircraft in an open space without buildings or trees. Take off the aircraft
      after 6 or more GPS satellites are found (Red LED blinks once or no blinking). If in Manual Mode or ATTI.
      Mode, you can skip this step.

  3. Start-up
        (1) Switch on the transmitter first, then power on multi-rotor! Keep the aircraft stationary until the
                system start and self-check has finished.
        (2) Please wait for the system to warm up gradually with the LED blinks Yellow 4 times quickly
                ( ). You should not start the motors until the blinking disappears.
        (3) Keep the aircraft stationary, and execute the CSC to start the motors.
        (4) Release the yaw, roll and pitch sticks and keep them at the mid point, at the same time raise the
                throttle stick from the bottom. The motors will stop if you do not push the throttle stick from the
                bottom within 3 sec and you will need to re-start the motors.
        (5) Keep raising the throttle stick until all the rotors are working, push the throttle stick to the mid point
                and then take-off your multi-rotor gently, pay attention not to push the stick excessively.
        (6) Pay attention to the aircraft movement at any time when flying, and use the sticks to adjust the
                aircraft's position. Keep the yaw, roll, pitch and throttle sticks at the mid point to hover the aircraft
                at the desired height.

 4. Lower the aircraft slowly. Pull the throttle stick to the bottom and then execute the CSC to stop the motors

      after landing.

 375. Please always power off the Multi-rotor first, and then switch off the transmitter after landing.

FLYING NOTES(VERY IMPORTANT)

          (1) If the warm up waiting is longer than 2 minutes (the 4 times Yellow blink continues), please power
                   off for 10 minutes, cold start, and then connect the assistant software, enter the "Tools" - > IMU
                   calibration, carry out the Advanced calibration.

          (2) If you enable the Immediately Mode of Motor Stop; you should not pull throttle stick under 10%
                   during flight, because it will stop motors. If you do it accidentally, you should push the throttle
                   stick over 10% in 5s to re-start motors.

          (3) DO NOT execute the CSC during normal flight without any reason, or it will stop motors at once.
          (4) Pay attention to the GPS satellite status LED indicator. Bad GPS signal may lead the aircraft to

                   drift when hovering.
          (5) DO NOT fly near to ferromagnetic substances, to avoid strong magnetic interference with the

                   GPS.
          (6) Please avoid using GPS ATTI. Mode in the areas, where GPS signal is most likely bad.
          (7) If the LED flashes quickly Red then this indicates battery voltage is low, land ASAP.
          (8) If the transmitter indicates low-battery alarm, please land ASAP. In this condition the transmitter

                   may cause the aircraft to go out of control or even crash.
          (9) In GPS ATTI. Mode, make sure that the home point is recorded when the GPS signal is well;

                   otherwise the home point recording may be not so precise.
          (1) In ATTI Mode, throttle stick center position is for 0m/s along the vertical direction. You should

                   keep the position of throttle stick higher than 10% from cut-throttle during the flight! In any
                   control mode, DO NOT pull throttle stick under 10% during normal flight without any reason.
          (2) It is recommended to land the aircraft slowly, to prevent the aircraft from damage when landing.
          (3) If Low-Voltage Alarm is set, the aircraft will act according to the configuration of the Assistant
                   Software once Low-Voltage Alarm is triggered. Make sure you remember what you have set
                   before.
          (4) If Fail-Safe function is set, the aircraft will act according to the configuration of the Assistant
                   Software once Fail-Safe is triggered. Make sure you remember what you have set before.

Note      1. Please make sure to record the home-point before takeoff, and clearly know where it is.
          2. During go-home the nose direction of the aircraft is facing toward the home-point, the aircraft is
          flying directly from the current position to the home-point.

          3. You can regain the control during the aircraft is hovering 15 seconds.

          This section will demonstrate the working logic of failsafe and how to regain control.                         The aircraft behavior
          The following description is effective only when:                                                              after failsafe

          Note: if you start the motors, but do not push the throttle to take-off the aircraft, in this case it is very dangerous to turn
          off the TX, because the aircraft will take off automatically, so do not try this.

          39* If signal lost for more than 3 seconds failsafe will be triggered, if signal regained within 3 seconds it will exit failsafe immediately.

A2 Low-Voltage Alert

In order to prevent your multi-rotor from a crash or other harmful consequences caused by low battery voltage,
there are two levels of low voltage protection available to use. You can choose to use or not to use them; however
we strongly recommend using the protections if available! Low-Voltage Alert is to indicate that the battery cannot
provide enough power for the aircraft, in order to warn you to land the aircraft ASAP. You can configure this
function in the assistant software, and please read the text in the software carefully before your flight. Make sure to
carry out the Current Voltage Calibration.

There are both first level and second level protections. The first level protection has LED warning. During second
level protection the aircraft will land automatically with LED warning. Meanwhile the center point of throttle stick
will move up slowly to 90% of endpoint, you should land ASAP to prevent your aircraft from crashing!
It is not for fun, you should land your aircraft ASAP to prevent your aircraft from crashing or other harmful
consequences!!!

             (1) Configure the FailSafe function in the assistant software -> "Advanced" -> "F/S" and read the
                     instruction thoroughly and carefully.

A3 Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) Flight (with GPS module)

Definition of Forward Direction:

Multi -rotor will fly along this direction when you push the elevator stick (  ).

Step1 Before You Start

Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using IOC, wherever the

nose points, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction. The red and blue arrows on the transmitter

are corresponding to pitch and roll operations in the following diagram.

 In course lock flying, the forward direction is the same as a recorded nose direction. All the following

requirements are met: the autopilot system is in ATTI. Mode or GPS ATTI. Mode.

              Normal flying                                               Course Lock Flying

 In home lock flying, the forward direction is the same as the direction from home point to multi-rotor. All the

following requirements are met: 6 or more GPS satellites are found, in GPS ATTI. Mode, and the aircraft is

further than 10m away from the home point.

                                         Normal flying                    Home Lock Flying

Step2 IOC Switch Setting

Before using the IOC function, you have to choose a 3-position switch on your transmitter as the IOC switch, which

is also used for recording the orientation, home position in corresponding modes. Refer to the assistant software;

click the "Advanced" to find the "IOC".

IOC Switch

                The above table is for example. The function of the switch position may be reversed since the
                normal/reversed setting of the switch channel. Toggle the switch and observe the slider position of

          41channel X2 on the assistant software screen, the corresponding area should turn blue.

Step3 Method of Forward Direction and Home Point Recording

If you use the IOC function, please be aware of the Forward Direction of Course Lock Flying, and the home point of

Home Lock Flying. There are two ways to record the forward direction and the home point: Manually and

Automatically. You may choose any one record method. The LED will blink Green quickly if successfully recorded.

                                Course Lock                  Home Lock

Automatically    30 seconds after you power on the           Before takeoff, the current position of the aircraft
                            autopilot system.                 will be saved as home point when you start the
                                                                motors for the first time after 6 or more GPS

                 autopilot system. Toggle the IOC switch     And the aircraft can be hovering. Toggle the IOC
                 from Off to Course Lock, and back to Off    switch from Course Lock to Home Lock, and back

                              quickly 3 to 5 times.                  to Course Lock quickly 3 to 5 times.

DO NOT toggle the switch between Off to Home Lock, since it may change the recording of the

              Forward Direction of Course Lock.

Step4 IOC Flying Test

Then you can do Course Lock and Home Lock flying test.

Carry out an IOC flight by the following procedure. The Control Mode LED will blink Yellow and Green

alternatively (  ) to indicate the IOC mode only when the main controller is really to fly in Course Lock, Home
Lock modes.

IOC FLYING NOTES
             (1) When Multi-rotor is flying by home lock far away from you and the home point, please DO NOT
                     toggle the IOC switch many times quickly so as to avoid the change of home point without your
                     attention.
             (1) Home lock flying requires that 6 or more GPS satellites are found and the aircraft is further than
                     10m away from the home point.
             (2) If the IOC flying requirement is not satisfied, the autopilot system will quit IOC control mode.
                     Please be aware of the LED indicator, to know the current control mode of the autopilot system.

(1) Blinking indications of IOC                   are:

a) Before motors start:                                 blink, all sticks (except throttle stick) return to center;

        blink, stick(s) (except throttle stick) not at center.

b) After motors start and throttle stick is over 10% in 3 seconds:                blink, all sticks

        return to center;                         blink, stick(s) not at center.

(2) Before you do the home lock flight, you have to fly the aircraft out of the 10m range around

home point, and then flip the IOC switch to Home Lock position to fly in home lock when all the

requirements are met. If you have already toggled the IOC switch to Home Lock position when

the aircraft is still in 10m range around home point, and this is the first time you are going to fly

in home lock during the current flight, then if all the requirements are met, the main controller

will change into home lock automatically when Multi-rotor flies out the 10m range around home

point.

(1) When flying in Home Lock mode, if any of the following situations happen, then the

        system will quit Home Lock flying and automatically enter Course Lock flying. The aircraft

        will fly in Course Lock using the earlier forward direction.

     a) The aircraft fly's within 10m range of the home point.
     b) You toggle the control mode switch to the ATTI. Mode.
     c) The GPS signal becomes bad (The GPS signal LED is blinking Red twice or three

              times).
(2) We suggest that you should know clearly which flight lock method you are going to fly,

        and you know the locked forward direction or home point, before you switch on IOC
        mode during the flight.

A4 Receiver Advanced Protection Function

You are asked to enable this function by connecting to the Assistant Software, please set it at the section of
Basic->R/C-> Receiver Advanced Protection.
If you choose enable it, the FailSafe will be triggered if the following situations occur during flight.
According to the difference of the aircraft height, there are two situations.
a) Lower than 100m, the A/E/R channel is not at the mid point.
b) Higher than 100m, the A/E/R channel is not at the mid point or the throttle stick is above the mid point.
In the GPS Mode or ATTI. Mode, if the requirement a) or b) is satisfied, and the output data of four channels
A/E/R/T have not changed for 20 seconds, then the aircraft will hover automatically. After that, if the output data
of four channels A/E/R/T still do not any changes and last for 10 seconds, the autopilot system will think that the
data from receiver is abnormal, and then enter the FailSafe Mode.
Brief introduction of how to quit the FailSafe Mode
If there is any command change from the receiver, the autopilot system thinks that the receiver is regained. In ATTI.
Mode and Manual Mode, it will quit the FailSafe Mode automatically. In GPS Mode, please toggle the control mode
switch to the ATTI. Mode and Manual Mode position to regain the control. Refer to the FailSafe section for more
details.

A5 Flight Limits

The flight limits function is default enabled in the NAZA-M Flight control system, it's aimed to restrict the flying
height and distance of the aircraft. The Max Height restricts the vertical distance between the aircraft and the
Home point, the Max Radius restricts the horizontal distance between the aircraft and the Home point.
The default Max Height is 2000m and Max Radius is 2000m. Users can write the values of the Max Height and Max
Radius in the Assistant software, the range of the Max Height is 10m-100000m, the range of the Max Radius is the
same. So that the aircraft will fly in the entered range, which is a cylinder space above the Home point.

             (1) Height Limit works when the control mode is GPS or ATTI. Mode. Radius Limit works when the
                     control mode is GPS and the satellite number 6.

             (2) If the aircraft flies out of the limits, it's still controllable except flying further away.
             (3) If the control mode is changed to GPS when the aircraft is out of Max Radius, the aircraft will fly

                     back within the entered range.
             (4) The Failsafe and the Ground Station operations are not restricted to the Flight Limits.

Abnormal LED Indication List

During the Checking Procedure, if abnormal LED Indicator occurs or even the system cannot work normally, please

refer to the following list and aids troubleshooting.

(1) "System initializing and self-checking LED flashes" are not correct (                     Red LED

appears in the last four green flashes). The autopilot system works abnormally. Please contact your

dealer.

(2) LED blinks Yellow 4 times quickly (                ). The system is warming up. You cannot start the motors until

the 4 rapid yellow flashes disappear. If the warm up waiting is longer than 2 minutes, please power off for

5 minutes, cold start, and then connect the assistant software, enter the "Tools" - > IMU calibration, carry

out the Advanced calibration.

(3) After the system start and self-checking has finished, if the LED blinks Red, Green and Yellow ( )

continually. Sensor error is too big. Please connect the assistant software, enter the "Tools" - > IMU

calibration, carry out calibration.

(4) At the first motors start, the system will check the sensors Bias and you are asked to keep the aircraft

stationary (no need of horizontal level). If you cannot start the motors and the LED blinks Green 6 times

quickly (       ), it means that the sensor error is too big. Please connect the assistant software,

enter the "Tools" - > IMU calibration, carry out basic calibration.

Note: after the first successful motors start, this checking will be disabled and it is no need any more to

keep the aircraft stationary during starting motors.

(5) The system blinks Red LED quickly during flying. Low-voltage protection is triggered. Please land the

aircraft ASAP.

(6) The system blinks Yellow LED quickly during flying. FailSafe Mode is triggered. Pay attention that there is

no tall buildings and trees to block your aircraft during go-home.

(7) The LED blinks Red and Yellow alternately (        ). Compass error is too big.

a) There may be a ferromagnetic substance close to the Phantom. Lift the aircraft up about 1m from

     the ground, if there is no Red and Yellow flashing, then it will not affect the flight.

b) Otherwise, re-calibrate the compass.

c) If re-calibration does not work, please connect to the Assistant Software, select the "Tools" and

     follow the tips to carry out the required operation.

Fix the TBE (Toilet Bowl Effect) Problem

When flying in GPS ATTI. Mode and the compass calibration has been done correctly, should you find the aircraft

In the following diagram (view from the top), the aircraft can appear to be rotating in both clockwise and

Should you find the multi-rotor does not track straight in forward flight.

Please carry out several more courses, the system will fix it automatically.

Motors Start failure caused by TX stick(s) mid point error too big

If the TX stick(s) mid point error is too big, Motors Start will fail when you execute the Combination Stick
Commands (CSC) and lead to the aircraft will not takeoff.. And the LED will blink Red four times per second
continually to warn you.
TX stick(s) mid point error too big can be caused by the following reasons:

        (1) There is TX stick (except the throttle stick) not at center when power on the autopilot system.
        (2) The TX sticks has been trimmed, which leads to the large deviation of mid point. For example, the

                SUB-TRIM has been adjusted for Futaba transmitter.
        (3) The TX stick(s) travel has larger asymmetry.

For the reason (1), please put all TX sticks at the mid point, and then power cycle the autopilot system to
 re-record the mid point. If the problem continues, that can be caused by the reason (2) or reason (3), yo

u need to adjust the output range of your TX, and then use the Assistant Software to redo the TX cali
bration. Please carry out the following procedures.

        (1) Connect to the Assistant software, click Basic-> R/C-> Command Sticks Calibration, and push all TX
                sticks throughout their complete travel range to see if any stick cannot reach its largest position.

        (2) Adjust the largest travel of TX stick until the cursor on the Assistant software can reach both end
                positions, according to your TX manual.

        (3) Power cycle the autopilot system, note that power cycle is required.

     53(4) Redo the TX calibration according to the Assistant software.

Attitude Controllable When One Motor Output is Failed

For Hexa-rotor, including Hexa-rotor I, Hexa-rotor V, Hexa-rotor IY and Hexa-rotor Y, aircraft is attitude controllable
when one motor output is failed.
The NAZA-M can still control the attitude of the Hexa-rotor for a safe landing when one motor output of the
Hexa-rotor has failed, for example, one motor is stopped or one propeller is broken, etc.
The control mode of NAZA-M should be in Atti. Mode or GPS Atti. Mode. The aircraft will rotate, due to an
imbalance of torque; however, it can still be controlled by the Transmitter.
Select Course lock or home lock mode for flying the aircraft into a safe area to land when the aircraft is far away or
the attitude can't be recognized. Even when the multi rotor is rotating, using Course lock or home lock mode will
allow you to move the multi rotor in the corresponding Transmitter stick direction.

When used with other DJI products

The NAZA-M system communicates with other DJI products (e.g. H3-2D gimbal, BTU module, iOSD mini and iOSD
Mark II) via the CAN-Bus port ( ) of the NAZA PMU V2. You can plug new DJI products into any spare CAN-Bus
port, since CAN-Bus ports on NAZA-M, CAN HUB, GCU, iOSD mini, iOSD Mark II and 2.4G Bluetooth Datalink are
the same for the communications.
When there are not enough CAN-Bus ports for additional DJI products, then a DJI CAN HUB module is
recommended. The following diagram is for your connection reference.
