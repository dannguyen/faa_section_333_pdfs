                                                           Exemption No. 12474
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­2216

Mr. Jeffery J. Antonelli
Antonelli Law
Counsel for DroneSense, LLC
35 E Wacker Drive, Suite 1875
Chicago, IL 60601

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of DroneSense, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct mapping and
surveying.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
                                                                                                                 2

consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, DroneSense, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, DroneSense, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
    weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012
and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of 14 C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of
DroneSense, LLC ("DroneSense"), an operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("UAs") for
mapping and surveying. Specifically, petitioner seeks an exemption from the Federal Aviation
Regulations ("FARs") listed in Appendix A to allow commercial operation of its UAs, so long as
such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be
established by the FAA in a grant of this petition. This request is substantially similar to other data
collection petitions previously approved, and should be considered under the expedited summary
grant procedure.

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of the DJI
Inspire 1 in Class G airspace nationwide unless otherwise prescribed by an Air Traffic
Organization (ATO) issued COA. This UA has been previously approved for commercial
operations in Exemption Nos. 11204, 11224, 11254, 11279, 11280, 11288, 11295, 11301, 11303,
11313, 11314, 11318, 11323, 11327, 11336, 11342, 11359, 11377, 11384, 11385, and 11394. The
UA covered by this petition is a small battery-powered craft, weighing approximately 6.5 lbs.,
inclusive of battery and payload. Operation of the UA under the strict conditions proposed below
will provide equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended, while still allowing commercial
operations. Operations using these UAs are far safer than conventional operations conducted with
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that weigh thousands of pounds, carry highly flammable fuel,
and operate in close proximity to the ground, trees, infrastructure, and people.

         Congress directed the FAA to consider seven factors in deciding whether to approve
Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports,
proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight. In this case, each factor
supports the exemption request. In particular, the UA is small, and will operate at slow speeds and
close to the ground. It will be able to more safely and efficiently conduct operations that would
otherwise involve risk of injury or death. The substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. §11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

    Petitioner seeks an exemption from the following rules:

    14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.27; 14
    C.F.R. 45.29; 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c); 14 C.F.R.
    91.103(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.105; 14 C.F.R. 91.109; 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b); 14 C.F.R.
    91.119 (c); 14 C.F.R. 91.121; 14 C.F.R. 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b); 14
    C.F.R. 91.215; 14 C.F.R. 91.403; 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.407(a)(1); 14
    C.F.R. 409(a)(1) and (2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to operate commercially
    small unmanned aircraft systems (UAs) (6.5 lbs. or less).

    Approval of the exemption requested by petitioner will allow commercial operation of
    the DJI Inspire 1 for the purpose of mapping and surveying in Class G airspace
    nationwide, unless otherwise prescribed by an ATO-issued COA. The requested
    exemption should be granted because operation of a small UA weighing approximately
    6.5 lbs. (2.9 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the strict conditions
    outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety, while still allowing
    commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the exemption are far safer
    than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft
    weighing thousands of pounds and carrying highly flammable fuel, and operating in
    close proximity to the ground and people. The seven factors Congress directed the FAA
    to consider when approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed,
    operational capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated areas, and
    operation within visual line of sight ­ each support the request. In particular, the aircraft
    are small, and will operate at slow speeds, and close to the ground. The substantial
    increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life, coupled with the low risk use of
    UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in favor of granting the exemption.

is under 65 ft. (20 m.) AGL, the UA will rise to 65 ft. AGL, travel horizontally to the pre-
designated home spot, hover for 15 seconds, then land. If the UA is above 65 ft. AGL, travel
horizontally to the pre-designated home spot, hover for 15 seconds, then land.

B. The Crew

         The crew will consist of a pilot in command (PIC) and a visual observer (VO). The PIC
and VO will have been trained in operation of UAs generally and received up-to-date information
on the UA to be operated pursuant to this grant. The PIC will have, at minimum, a sport pilot
license and a U.S. driver's license. Please refer to Exhibit 1, Section 4: Flight Training and
Certification/Re-Certification for further information regarding crew training.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the training and
characteristics of the crew are numbers 3 and 6-9 in Section V below. Each has been adopted or
imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

                                                          6
C. Flight Conditions

         The UA will be used for utility and infrastructure inspections in Class G airspace (unless
otherwise prescribed by an ATO-issued COA) under 400 feet above ground level ("AGL") and
under controlled conditions over restricted property. Petitioner will work with the local FSDO
when planning operations. Petitioner will only operate its UA in visual meteorological conditions
(VMC). The UA will at all times be no less than 500 feet below and no less than 2,000 feet
horizontally from a cloud, and petitioner will not conduct operations unless visibility is at least 3
statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always make a safety assessment of the risk of
every operation, and will only operate when it is determined that no hazards are present.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to the flight conditions in
which the UA will be operated are numbers 2, 4, 16, and 28-29 in Section V below. Each has been
adopted or imposed by the FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

D. Flight Operations

         The purpose of the UA flights for which exemption is requested will be for mapping and
surveying. Every UA flight will use at minimum a two person flight crew: a PIC and a VO.
Petitioner will fly the UA no higher than 400 feet above ground level (AGL).

         Please refer to the following exhibits for more information regarding flight operations:
         Exhibit 1:

                  Section 3: Safety Management
                  Section 5: sUAS Maintenance
                  Section 6: Flight Operations
         Exhibit 3 beginning on page 49 of that document
         Exhibit 4

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 11-12, 17-25, and 32-35 in Section V below. Each has been accepted or imposed by the
FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

IV. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at least
equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory structure.
Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to be bound
when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A contains a
matrix connecting (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for which it
provides equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333 exemption grants in
which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety.

         Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national
security issue. The PIC will possess, at minimum, a sport pilot's certificate, so he or she will
have been subject to security screenings by the Department of Homeland Security.

                                                          7
V. Proposed Conditions of the Exemption

1. The UAs, including battery and technical payload will weigh no more than approximately 6.5
    lbs. (2.9 kg.).

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of utility and infrastructure inspections in Class G airspace nationwide, unless otherwise
    prescribed by an ATO issued COA.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a PIC and VO.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in feet
    AGL.

5. The UA will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 43 knots.

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the UA PIC and a VO.

7. The PIC will have at minimum a sport pilot license and either a U.S. driver's license or a third
    class medical certificate.

8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification criteria
    and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with how the UA
    will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR
    §61.51(b). A record of the PIC training will be documented and made available upon request
    by the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during dedicated training
    sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential
    for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with
    appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance has
    been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance and
                                                          8
    alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in
    accordance with the UA manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements set forth in the operating documents.
    Maintenance, inspection, alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts will
    be noted in the aircraft records, including total time in service, description of work
    accomplished, and the signature of the authorized person returning the UA to service. The
    authorized person will make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken against
    discrepancies discovered between inspections.

15. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will not
    be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight operations.

16. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there
    is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and prepare to
    land with at least 25% battery power remaining.

17. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 25% battery
    reserve.

18. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

19. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will
    return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered
    in accordance with the operating documents.

20. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

21. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow the
    procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating documents,
    it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request. If the
    petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA
    granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant of

                                                          9
    exemption.

22. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents of
    the landowners over which flights will be conducted.

23. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or city
    jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

24. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

25. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, altitude level
    and potential transponder requirements.

26. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM
    as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport management will
    be made available to the Administrator upon request.

27. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally from,
    a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

28. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

29. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

30. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

31. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

32. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

33. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating persons,
    vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

                                                         10
    a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the
         UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
         nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
         nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
         will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

    b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
         such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
         present undue hazard.

    c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
         undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

34. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the National
    Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site:
    www.ntsb.gov.

VI. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy. All flights
will occur over either (a) public rights of way where there is no expectation of privacy; or (b) over
private property with permission of the landowner/authorized agent and consent of participating
individuals.

         Petitioner will follow the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International
(AUVSI) Code of Conduct for all operations. Please refer to Exhibit 1, Section 7: Privacy for more
information regarding petitioner's privacy policy.

VII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety for aerial mapping and surveying
operations. This type of data collection has previously been done by manned aircraft or by
individuals on the ground. Both are more time consuming and are more expensive than using a
UA. Use of manned aircraft poses enhanced risk to the pilot and onboard crew, who would be
several hundred feet in the air.

         The enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact achieved using a UA and carrying
no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying
crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UA operation
enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

         DroneSense has prepared a risk management tool that it will utilize during operations. This
tool is found in Exhibit 1, Appendix A.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation

                                                         11
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of petitioner's UA in the utility
and infrastructure inspection industries, pursuant to DroneSense's rules of operation.

         The FAA has previously approved the Inspire 1 for similar commercial operations in the
following Exemptions:

         11288 (aerial surveying)
         11295 (aerial surveying)
         11303 (aerial surveying)
         11323 (aerial videography for mapping)
         11336 (aerial surveying)
         11394 (aerial photography and survey)

                                                         12

EN  Reading Inspire 1 Manuals

    The following tutorials and manuals have been produced to help you make full use of your DJI Inspire 1:
    1. In The Box
    2. Disclaimer and Warning
    3. Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines
    4. INSPIRE 1 Safety Guidelines
    5. INSPIRE 1 Quick Start Guide
    6. INSPIRE 1 User Manual
    Check all of the included parts listed in the In The Box document. Read the Disclaimer and Warning,
    Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines, and INSPIRE 1 Safety Guidelines before flight. Then prepare for
    your first flight by using the INSPIRE 1 Quick Start Guide and watching all of the tutorial videos. If you have
    questions, refer to the INSPIRE 1 User Manual for more comprehensive information. Experienced users,
    particularly those who have previously used DJI products, may choose to skip to the Inspire 1 Quick Start
    Guide to begin preparing for flight.

    Individual Parts

    Remote Controller

    1. Linking is required if you wish to replace your remote controller or receiver, or add a new remote controller.
       Refer to the user manual for more information about how to link the aircraft.

    2. If the remote controller is powered on and has not been used for 5 minutes, it will sound an alert. After 10
       minutes it will automatically power off. Move the sticks or perform some other action to cancel the alert.

    3. A Slave remote controller cannot be linked with the aircraft and cannot control the aircraft's flight. You may
       change it to a Master remote controller via the DJI Pilot app, and then link it to the aircraft to control flight.

    4. Ensure the Mobile Device Holder is firmly in place and does not slip.
    5. For the GPS in the remote controller to function properly, and the Dynamic Home Point to be accurate,

       ensure the DJI logo is facing the sky and keep the remote controller away from any metal objects.
    6. Repair or replace the remote controller if damaged. A damaged remote controller antenna will greatly

       decrease performance.
    7. When on the go, you may charge the remote controller from the aircraft's Intelligent Flight Battery.

    Camera

    1. Photos or videos cannot be transmitted or copied from the camera if the Intelligent Flight Battery is powered off.
    2. Be sure to power off the Intelligent Flight Battery correctly, otherwise your camera parameters will not be saved

       and any recorded videos may be damaged.
    3. Test the camera by shooting a few test images to check that it is operating correctly before shooting important

       pictures.
    4. Respect the privacy of others when using the camera. Make sure you comply with local privacy laws, regulations

       and moral standards.
    5. Check camera settings before use to make sure you can adjust them to fit your needs.

    Gimbal

    1. The gimbal and gimbal connector are very delicate. Handle with care and do not touch the gimbal
       connector, as any damage will cause it to function abnormally.

    2. A gimbal motor error may occur if: (1) The aircraft is placed on uneven ground or other objects obstruct
       the gimbal's full range of motion, or (2) The gimbal has undergone an excessive impact, e.g. a collision.
       Please only takeoff from flat, open areas and protect the gimbal after powering up.

    3. Hold the gimbal firmly when detaching or reattaching it, so it does not drop.
    4. Do not add any payloads to the gimbal, as this may cause the gimbal to function abnormally, or even

    2 © 2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.  17
   lead to motor damage.
5. Precision elements in the gimbal may be damaged by a collision or impact, which will cause the gimbal

   to function abnormally.

Compass                                                                                                               EN

1. Ensure the compass is calibrated before every flight. Failure to calibrate may lead to a poor flight
   performance or even failure.

2. DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a chance of strong magnetic interference. This includes areas
   where there are massive metal objects, parking structures, steel reinforcements underground, or under bridges.

3. DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration, such as keys or mobile phones.
4. The compass should always be recalibrated when moving from indoor spaces to outdoor spaces.
5. If the rear LED shows a solid red light, compass calibration has failed. Please recalibrate.
6. After successful calibration, the compass may become abnormal when you put the aircraft on the

   ground. This is because of magnetic interference that may be underground. Move the aircraft to another
   location and try again.

Parameter Settings

The Inspire 1 features a built-in flight control system to make operation as safe as possible. However, it is
good practice to remove all propellers before switching it on for calibration or changing other parameter
settings.

Battery

Refer to the Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines and battery sticker for usage and maintenance information.

Storage and Transportation

1. Store the Intelligent Flight Battery and remote controller in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight,
   to ensure the built-in LiPo battery does not overheat. Recommended storage temperature: between
   22°C and 28°C for storage periods of more than three months. Never store in environments outside the
   temperature range of -20°C to 45°C.

2. Do not allow the camera to come into contact with, or become immersed in, water or other liquids. If it
   gets wet, wipe dry with a soft, absorbent cloth. Turning on an aircraft that has fallen into water may cause
   permanent component damage. Do not use substance containing alcohol, benzene, thinners or other
   flammable substances to clean or maintain the camera. Do not store the camera in humid or dusty areas.

3. Always keep all parts out of the reach of children, as the cables, straps or small parts may be dangerous
   if swallowed. If swallowed, go to the hospital immediately.

4. Detach the gimbal from the Inspire 1 when storing for a long period of time or transporting over long
   distances. Also replace the Gimbal Cover when storing.

Maintenance and Upkeep

1. Check every part of the aircraft if it is violently impacted. If you have any problems or questions, please

EN  Flight Environment Requirements

    1. Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speed exceeding 10m/s, snow,
       rain, smog, heavy wind, hail, lightning, tornado or hurricane.

    2. Do not use the aircraft in dust or sandstorms.
    3. Fly in open areas, as tall buildings or steel structures may affect the accuracy of the onboard compass

       and block the GPS signal.
    4. Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, people, animals, high voltage power lines, trees, and bodies of

       water when in flight.
    5. Avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment. Make sure to turn off the

       Wi-Fi on your mobile device.
    6. Do not fly near areas with magnetic or radio interference. These include but are not limited to: high

       voltage lines, large scale power transmission stations, mobile base stations and broadcasting towers.
       Failing to do so may compromise the transmission quality of this product, cause remote controller and
       video transmission errors may affect flight orientation and location accuracy. The aircraft may behave
       abnormally or fall out of control in areas with too much interference.
    7. P mode is unavailable in polar zones. Users can use ATTI mode instead.
    8. Do not fly the aircraft within no-fly zones specified by local laws and regulations.

    Flight Warnings

    Failsafe and Return to Home

    1. Return to Home will not work if the GPS signal is insufficient or GPS is not active.
    2. Press the RTH Button on the remote controller to bring the aircraft back to the Home Point instead of

       turning off the remote controller.
    3. Tall buildings may adversely affect the Failsafe function. Please adjust the aircraft location, altitude and

       speed while returning home to avoid obstacles.
    4. Make sure to always fly the aircraft within the transmission range of the remote controller.
    5. When updating the Home Point, do not block the GPS signal of the remote controller and ensure the new

       Home Point is correct on the live map.
    6. Do not update the Home Point near tall buildings, as the GPS may be blocked and lead to an incorrect

       location being stored.
    7. Only use the Failsafe and Return to Home functions in case of emergency, as they may be affected by

       the weather, the environment, or any nearby magnetic fields.

    Low Battery

    1. When the Critical Battery Level Warning activates and the aircraft is descending automatically, you may
       push the throttle upward to hover the aircraft and navigate it to a more appropriate location for landing.

    2. When battery warnings are triggered, please bring the aircraft back to the Home Point or land to avoid
       losing power during flight.

    Vision Positioning System

    1. The Vision Positioning System cannot work properly over surfaces that do not have pattern variations.
       The effective altitude for Vision Positioning System to function correctly is less than 2.5 meters.

    2. Vision Positioning System may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water.
    3. Vision Positioning System may not be able to recognize patterns on the ground in low light conditions (less

       than 100 lux).
    4. Keep your pets away from the aircraft when Vision Positioning System is activated, as the sonar sensors

       emit high frequency sound that is only audible to some pets.
    5. Note that Visual Positioning System may not function properly when the aircraft is flying too fast or too low.

                         TRANSFORMING DESIGN

Carbon fiber arms give you the strength to maneuver in the air and they transform, moving out of the camera's way at the flick of a switch. With a full 360
                              unobstructed view, you now have the freedom to capture shots independent of the direction you are flying.

   Every part, every component of the Inspire 1 was engineered to be durable and lightweight. The body's aerodynamic design cuts through the sky and
                               further enhances your control over the aircraft. This ensures long flight times and a long operational life.

                                                                                                                                                        62

   FLY INDOORS AND WITHOUT GPS
   USING VISION POSITIONING SYSTEM

       Indoor flight has always been a true test of skill for all levels of pilots. DJI's new
         Vision Positioning technology uses a specially designed camera as well as sonic
        waves to bring simplicity to flying indoors. This technology allows the Inspire to hold
         its position, stop when the controls are released, and respond to your commands
        even when GPS is unavailable.

INTELLIGENT POWER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A fully integrated intelligent battery powers your Inspire 1 and
virtually manages itself.

When in flight, your remaining battery power is shown live, letting
  you know how long you can continue to fly. Advanced
 algorithms calculate the distance of your aircraft and estimated
time to return home, letting you know when it's time to fly back.

The battery reports the voltage of each cell, the total lifetime
 charges and discharges, and the overall health and battery
status. All this helps you keep your Inspire 1 in the air and flying
for years to come.

                                                                                                 66
