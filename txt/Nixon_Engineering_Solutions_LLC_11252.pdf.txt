                                                          Exemption No. 11252
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0763

Mr. Jeffery J. Antonelli
Counsel for Nixon Engineering
 Solutions, LLC

100 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated September 24, 2014, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on behalf of Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for
an exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft
system (UAS) to conduct aerial inspection and photogrammetry services for the mining, oil,
and gas industry.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

Discussion of Public Comments:

A summary of the petition was published in the Federal Register on October 17, 2014,
(79 FR 62508). Three comments were received. The Small UAV Coalition (Coalition)
                                                                                                                 2

supported the petition, while the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) and the
National Agricultural Aviation Association (NAAA) opposed it.

In support of the petition, the Coalition stated the petitioner has proposed to abide by stronger
safety measures than hobby and modeler groups operating similar aircraft. The Coalition
stated that it does not believe that heightened safety measures should be required for the
petitioner simply because of the commercial nature of its operations. The Coalition urged the
FAA to adopt an evaluation framework for UAS operations under Section 333 of
Public Law 112­95 that weighs the relative safety issues and risks of UAS by class and
operational circumstances, rather than adopting artificial distinctions among unmanned aerial
vehicles based on commercial and noncommercial operations. The petitioner's UAS pose
considerably less safety risk than larger UAS. The Coalition asserted that because UAS
operations like the petitioner's pose minimal risk to safety, they should be subject to minimal
and appropriate regulations.

The Coalition noted the FAA is to consider the seven factors1 in Section 333 as a minimum.
The Coalition stated the petition shows the FAA should consider factors other than those
specified in Section 333, such as location, altitude of its UAS, restricted operating areas,
proven experience of the sUAS in other countries, and pilot experience. The Coalition
maintained that the petitioner's proposed operations satisfy the seven factors in Section 333
and include several additional mitigating factors to ensure the safety and security of the
proposed UAS operations. The Coalition emphasized the FAA must evaluate each factor
within the context of the petitioner's proposed UAS operations.

The Coalition also commented that the FAA should grant relief from the requirement to hold
an airman's certificate. The Coalition further stated that if an airman certificate is required
then, at a minimum the, FAA should provide an exception from the training and testing
requirements in part 61 in favor of requirements pertinent to the aircraft and operation
proposed. The Coalition also asserted that in section 333 Congress intended for the FAA to
consider national security with respect to the operation as opposed to addressing it through
pilot certification.

The FAA notes that, as discussed in the grant of exemption to Trimble Navigation Ltd.
(Exemption No. 11110), neither section 333, nor the FAA's exemption authority2 allows the
FAA to exempt pilots from the statutory requirement to hold an airman certificate as
prescribed in 49 USC § 44711.

1 Section 333(b) of P.L. 112-95 states, in part: "In making the determination under subsection (a), the Secretary
shall determine, at a minimum-- (1) which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size,
weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within visual line
of sight do not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to
national security; ..."
2 49 USC § 44701(f)
                                                                                                                 3

The Coalition commented that a visual observer (VO) should not be required for all small
UAS operations. The Coalition further asserted that the presence of one or more VOs may
allow the UAS to be operated beyond VLOS of the PIC.

The FAA notes that one of the determinations for operations under section 333 is operation
within visual line of sight. The PIC must maintain VLOS while operating the UA. The FAA
finds that a VO complements the PIC's capability to see and avoid other aircraft, including
when the PIC may be momentarily attending to other flying tasks. The VO provides an
additional level of operational safety.

ALPA expressed concern regarding several aspects of the petition. ALPA noted the petitioner
does not detail procedures for controlling the airspace or area of operation. Specifically,
ALPA stated "there must be means both to ensure that the sUAS remains within the defined
airspace and to ensure that the hazard of other aircraft intruding on the operation is
mitigated." The FAA believes the limitations under which the petitioner will operate (i.e.,
VLOS and at or below 400 feet AGL) are sufficient mitigations to this risk so that the
operations will not adversely affect safety.

Regarding the petitioner's statement that the PIC and observer will be able to communicate by
voice or text, ALPA noted that text messaging could have an unknown latency and extend to
several minutes. ALPA also stated voice communication with the pilot is a limited mitigation
if both the pilot and observer are not able to maintain a visual observation of both the aircraft
and the area. NAAA stated UAS observers must be present and able to communicate with the
operator from the most minimal distance possible. The conditions and limitations regarding
PIC and VO communications address those concerns.

ALPA asserted the UAS's lithium polymer batteries have numerous associated fire and
explosion hazards as outlined in DOT/FAA/AR-09/55, "Flammability Assessment of
Lithium-Ion and Lithium-Ion Polymer Battery Cell Designed for Aircraft Power Usage
(January 2010)," and that the safe carriage of the batteries and the mitigations in place for
known risks should be addressed. The referenced study was primarily conducted to determine
how certain battery cells react in a fire situation aboard manned airplanes. Given the size of
the battery and the operating conditions of the UAS, the FAA concludes that the use of a
lithium polymer battery will not pose an undue safety risk for the proposed operations.

ALPA commented that command and control (C2) link failures are one of the most common
failures on a UAS, and that lost link mitigations should require safe modes to prevent fly-
aways or other scenarios. The FAA has inserted conditions and limitations in this exemption
to mitigate the risk associated with such failures.

ALPA also noted that the petitioner's proposed operations are for "compensation or hire," and
therefore contends the pilot must hold at least a current FAA commercial pilot certificate with
an appropriate category and class rating for the type of aircraft being flown, as well as specific
and adequate training on the UAS make and model intended to be used. Similarly, ALPA
                                                                                                                 4

asserted a current second-class airman medical certificate should be required. NAAA also
commented on pilot qualification, stating--

         Just as manned aircraft pilots are required to undergo a rigorous training
         curriculum and show that they are fit to operate a commercial aircraft, so too
         must UAS operators. Holding a commercial certificate holds UAS operators to
         similar high standards as commercial aircraft operators and ensures they are
         aware of their responsibilities as commercial operators within the NAS.
         Medical requirements ensure they have the necessary visual and mental acuity
         to operate a commercial aircraft repeatedly over a sustained period of time.

The FAA has reviewed the knowledge and training requirements of sport, recreational, private
and commercial certificates and concluded that a UAS PIC holding a minimum of a sport pilot
certificate, and operating under this exemption, would not adversely affect operations in the
NAS or present a hazard to persons or property on the ground..

Regarding the petitioner's request for exemption from § 91.113, ALPA noted the petitioner
must specify a means to meet see and avoid requirements in § 91.113 given the absence of an
onboard pilot. The FAA notes that all flights must be operated within VLOS of the PIC and
VO.

In response to the petitioner's request for exemption from the minimum safe altitude
requirements of § 91.119, ALPA stated all aircraft in the NAS must operate to the same high
level of safety. ALPA argued this includes maintaining a safe altitude for both airplanes and
helicopters.

ALPA commented that the aircraft will not have a barometric altimeter as required by
14 CFR § 91.121. ALPA stated that processes or mitigations must be in place to ensure the
UA can accurately maintain altitude including redundant control capability, fail-safe systems,
backups and specific, validated procedures for system and equipment failures must be in
place. The FAA agrees with ALPA and addresses this concern in its analysis of the exemption
from 14 CFR § 91.121, finding that the alternative means of compliance proposed by the
petitioner does not adversely affect safety.

Regarding the fuel requirements of § 91.151, ALPA argued that using batteries as the only
source of an aircraft's power is a substantial shift from traditional methods of propulsion, and
requires further research to determine best safety practices.

ALPA also expressed concern that the petition makes no reference to compliance with, or a
request for waiver from, 14 CFR 61.195, Flight instructor limitations and qualifications,
which defines the requirements for flight instructors. A certificated flight instructor is
authorized to provide the instruction required for the certificates or ratings or currency listed
in 14 CFR § 61.193. A person instructing on how to operate the UAS under the petitioner's
training program would not need to be a certificated flight instructor because the instruction is
                                                                                                                 5

not being provided for a certificate or rating listed in § 61.193. We note that none of the UAS
operations proposed by the petitioner require such flight instruction because § 61.31(l) allows
for operation of the UAS by an airman who is current per 14 CFR § 61.56 without a category
and class rating. Instruction provided toward obtaining the pilot certificate required by this
exemption would need to be provided by a certificated flight instructor.

ALPA opposed the request for exemption from the transponder requirements of § 91.215.
ALPA stated relief from the requirements is already available in § 91.215(d)(3), and noted
they object to sUAS not meeting certification and equipage standards.

ALPA expressed concern on whether the petitioner's UAS can comply with the aircraft light
requirements for night operations in § 91.209, given its limited electric power. This
exemption limits operations to daytime only.

Regarding §§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(2), and 91.417(a) and (b), ALPA opposed
the petitioner's attempt to avoid compliance with established aircraft maintenance and
recordkeeping requirements. ALPA states the UAS should comply with the same level of
safety as other aircraft operated commercially in the NAS. The FAA finds that adherence to
the petitioner's operating documents, as required by the conditions and limitations below, is
sufficient to ensure that safety is not adversely affected.

ALPA also expressed concern that the petitioner's request is not for a single specific
operation or location, but for all operations of the same general type. ALPA stated that this
results in a considerable increase in the FAA's oversight tasks. The FAA notes ALPAs
concern and in order to minimize potential impact to the NAS, the FAA that requires each
operator secure a Certificate of Authorization or COA which covers specific details of the
petitioners operation. The FAA recognizes that UAS integration will generate new NAS
access demand and will review and adjust accordingly.

NAAA noted that its members operate in low-level airspace, and therefore clear low-level
airspace is vital to the safety of these operators. NAAA stated that seeing and avoiding other
aircraft and hazardous obstructions is the backbone for agricultural safety, and that
agricultural pilots depend on pilots of other aircraft to perform their see-and-avoid functions
to prevent collisions. NAAA believes UAS operations at low altitudes will increase the
potential for collision with agricultural aircraft.

The FAA recognizes these concerns and has incorporated associated conditions and
limitations into this exemption, including: (a) a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued for all
operations; (b) operations conducted within VLOS of the pilot in command (PIC) and the VO;
and (c) the UAS PIC must always yield right-of-way to manned aircraft.
                                                                                                                 6

NAAA stated that FAA airworthiness certification should be a requirement for all unmanned
aircraft to operate within the NAS. NAAA recommended UAS be equipped with ADS-B or
similar identification and positioning systems, strobe lights, high-visibility markings and
registration numbers. NAAA also recommended UAS be operated strictly within the line-of-
sight of the ground controller, with the assistance of a VO and clear of any low-flying manned
aircraft.

As discussed in greater detail below, Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act
of 2012 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to determine, considering a number of
factors laid out in the statute, that an airworthiness certificate is not necessary for certain
operations. The Secretary has made that determination in this case and therefore the aircraft
operated by the petitioner will not need to be certificated by the FAA.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI S800 EVO.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;
                                                                                                                 7

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Nixon Engineering Solutions, LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI S800 EVO
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.
                                                                                                            8

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
    be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.
                                                                                             9

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in 14
    CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
                                                                                                          10

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
    as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.
                                                                                       11

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

         Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:

         14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.21;
         14 C.F.R. 45.23; 14 C.F.R. 45.25; 14 C.F.R. 45.27; 14 C.F.R. 45.29; 14 C.F.R.
         47.3(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 47.31(c); 14 C.F.R. 61.113; 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 14 C.F.R.
         91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c); 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.105; 14 C.F.R.
         91.109; 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b); 14 C.F.R. 91.115; 14 C.F.R. 91.119(b)(c); 14 C.F.R.
         91.121; 14 C.F.R. 91.151; 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b); 14 C.F.R. 215; 14 C.F.R.
         91.403; 14 C.F.R. 91.405; 14 C.F.R. 91.407; 14 C.F.R. 409; and 14 C.F.R. 91.417
         to operate commercially a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) (15lbs or less).

         Approval of exemptions for Nixon Engineering will allow commercial operations
         of sUASs in the open mine and natural gas well pad inspection industry, enhancing
         safety by removing the risk of physical harm to surveyors otherwise exposed to
         dangerous coal piles and heavy equipment in the mine, and dangerous SO2 gases
         at the well heads. Current inspection operations involve having two men spend
         several hours inspecting each location in dangerous conditions with the risk of
         sliding down steep coal piles, inhaling dangerous chemicals, spontaneous fires, and
         heat related injuries when the temperature in the sites can reach over 100ºF in the
         summer months. In contrast, a sUAS weighing fewer than 15lbs. and powered by
         batteries eliminates virtually all of that risk to the two men involved.

         The operation of small UASs, weighting less than 15lbs., conducted in the strict
         conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the
         grant of the exemptions requested herein, including exempting the applicant from
         the requirements of Part 21 and allowing commercial operations. These lightweight
         aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to the ground, and in a low risk, low population
         environment and, as a result, are far safer than conventional operations conducted
         with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft operating in close proximity to the ground
         and people. The intended use of the sUAS operations contemplated by this petition
         is in the public interest because it clearly satisfies the "Four D's" of exemplary uses
         of UAS: to replace work by humans that is Dangerous, Difficult, Dull, and Dirty,
         and at the same time provides an equivalent or greater level of safety.

         Finally, the petitioner requests exemption from the requirement of the PIC
         possessing a private or commercial pilot's license. Research studies cited by
         petitioner, sponsored by the FAA and Army Research Laboratory, demonstrate that
         UAS, even those much larger than the sUAS proposed by Nixon Engineering
         Solutions LLC, can be safely flown by non-certificated pilots with a small amount
         of training. However, in the alternative, petitioner requests that if the agency
         concludes the PIC qualifications proposed in this exemption request do not meet
         the interim standards it is implementing, it should not deny the application on that
         ground. Rather, it should grant the exemption subject to Nixon Engineering
         Solutions LLC meeting whatever interim PIC qualifications the agency has adopted

                                                          5
         in other Section 333 exemption proceedings, for example the PIC qualification
         policies established in any of the pending exemption petitions of NextEra Energy,
         Inc., Oceaneering International, Inc., or Aeryon Labs, Inc.

III. Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC's Operations

A. The sUAS

         The requested exemption will permit the operation of small, unmanned multirotor aircraft
based on the DJI S800, weighing less than fifteen (15) pounds (inclusive of batteries and technical
payload). This rotorcraft operates at a speed of no more than thirty (30) knots and has the capability
to hover and move in the vertical and horizontal planes simultaneously.

         The sUAS will have the following specifications or equivalent:

Airframe: DJI S800 EVO
Control System: A2
Tx: Futaba 14 SG
Rx: Internal in A2
Motors: DJI 4114
Propellers: Tiger RC 15" Carbon Fiber
Data Link: DJI 2.4 Ghz Data Link
OSD: iOSD Mark II
Gimbal: Zenmuse
Camera: Sony Nex7
Batteries: Glacier from RC Buddy (6000mA 6-cell with EC5 main power connection)

         Please refer to Exhibits 3-7, attached to this petition, for further information about the S800
EVO and the A2 control system.

B. Flight conditions

         The sUAS will be flown in airspace under 400 feet above ground level ("AGL") and under
                                                          6
controlled conditions on restricted, rural, private property. The sUAS will be used to monitor two
different types of sites, open pit mines and natural gas well pads.

    1. Open Mines

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC proposes exemption under Section 333 to operate
commercially in private, secured-entry open mining operations, including but not limited to, Dolet
Hills Lignite Mine in Desoto Parish, Louisiana, and Oxbow Mine in the adjacent Red River Parish.
Both mines are privately owned and in extremely rural parishes (a "parish" is Louisiana's
equivalent to a county). The surrounding area's primary land use is timber farming, pasture land,
and farming. They are between four and ten miles to uncontrolled runways, and are both in class
G airspace. Both properties are fenced off and have manned and secured gates which restrict public
access.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC intends to operate in other, similarly rural areas in the
United States, if permitted. Any open mine operations will be guarded and restricted to rural
locations in Class G airspace and at least four miles from any controlled and uncontrolled runways,
to protect the public from hazardous conditions.

    2. Natural Gas Well Pads

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC proposes exemption under Section 333 to operate
commercially at private natural gas well pads including but not limited to the Haynesville Shale
Natural Gas play, which encompasses portions of the Desoto, Red River, Caddo, and Bossier
Parishes. The surrounding area's primary land use is timber and pasture farming. The well pads
will located in rural areas in class G airspace. The properties will be fenced off and secured, which
will restrict public access.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC intends to expand its natural gas well pads into other,
similarly rural areas in the United States if permitted. Any additional operations will be guarded
and restricted to rural locations in Class G area space and at least four miles from any uncontrolled
runways, to protect the public from hazardous conditions.

C. Flight Operations

         The purpose of every sUAS flight will be to safely, accurately, and efficiently create survey
maps of open mines and to inspect well pads. The sUAS will collect photogrammetric pictures,
survey equipment to set ground control points, and use specialized photogrammetry software to
process the data. The survey output will be 3D surface models and high resolution aerial
photographs.

         Every sUAS flight will use at minimum a two man flight crew, both possessing engineering
credentials. The Pilot in Command (PIC) will have substantial prior experience with operating the
sUAS, and possess a degree in professional engineering and land surveying. The assistant/spotter
will be a licensed engineer intern.

         The standard pre-flight and operational procedure will be as follows:

  1. Meet at security gate and complete pre-flight security appropriate to each site (described
                                                          7
      below).
  2. Drive to area to be surveyed.
  3. The Pilot in Command begins to ready sUAS for flight.

         a. Set up hand held weather station on tripod.
         b. Check over airframe, connections, and propellers for any damage during transport in

             vehicle. While the airframe has the ability to disassemble easily for transport, the sUAS
             will remain fully assembled. The sUAS is transported in the back of a truck which has
             a camper shell and straps installed to secure the sUAS in place to minimize electrical
             connection fatigue.
         c. Install and calibrate camera in gimbal.
         d. Turn on and ready lap top on tailgate.
         e. Connect communication antennae to laptop.
         f. Open Ground Station software and pull up pre-planned photogrammetry flight path.
         g. Boot up secondary GPS for tracking and geocoding pictures.
         h. Attach secondary GPS to sUAS.
         i. Remove main flight Tx1 from case and power up, verify voltage and settings.
         j. Remove gimbal Tx from case and power up, verify voltage and settings.
         k. Remove dual battery pack for flight, measure current voltage, log in battery manual.
         l. Strap batteries securely on to sUAS, do not attached main power.
         m. Move sUAS to take off point, approximately 30 feet from truck and crew.
         n. Attach main power.
         o. Listen to power up sequence of beeps for ESC and motors.
         p. Using Flight Tx cycle through different control modes observing LED lights for good
             connection and response.
         q. Using Gimbal Tx cycle through all controls making sure the gimbal and camera
             respond to commands.
         r. Remove secondary GPS and hold in front of camera taking picture to record a time
             stamp picture.
         s. Reattach secondary GPS.
         t. Set up traffic cones around sUAS with approximately a 20 foot radius. This is the
             "home" area and the operators are not allowed inside this area while the electrical motor
             is running.
         u. Walk back to truck with both Tx.
         v. Using Flight Tx activate engine power without moving throttle up. This checks that the
             automatic throttle kill is working and also records the "home" point.
         w. Using laptop Ground Station now select button connecting laptop to sUAS.
         x. sUAS should appear on the screen, along with a recorded home point, battery voltage,
             current altitude relative to the ground, and current velocity.
         y. Upload flight path data to sUAS.
         z. Verify good upload and connection.
         aa. Verify weather from portable weather station.
         bb. Record time and weather in Flight Log.
         cc. sUAS is now fully prep and ready to go.

1 "Tx" represents radio transmitter for command and control. "Rx" represents radio receiver for
command and control.

                                                          8
         dd. Waits for secondary crew member to return from setting out GCP's.
  4. While Pilot in Command is readying the aircraft the second crew member is preparing the

      Ground Control Points (GPC's) and walking the site.
         a. Power up and calibrates the survey grade GPS equipment.
         b. Begin setting GCP's and shooting center of targets with survey GPS.
         c. While setting out GCP's secondary crew is also making sure area is clear of all people.

  5. Typically secondary crew and pilot finish at about the same time. Upon his return, the
      secondary crew member sets the survey GPS to the side and sits next to the lap top and
      camera Tx.

  6. Pilot double checks take-off area is clear.
  7. Pilot takes off flying to the approximate survey altitude.
  8. Pilot instructs secondary crew member to initiate preprogrammed flight path.
  9. Secondary Crew verifies that the Ground Station has good connection and is tracking the

      sUAS.
  10. Secondary crew then turns on the camera to take pictures at a continuous interval.
  11. During entire preprogrammed flight Pilot always has visual line of sight and is prepared to

      take over flight operations. Pilot's Tx has a flight count down timer which is set to a
      minimum of 20% battery reserve (Calculated based on prior field experience to safely return
      the sUAS to safe landing with ample margin of error). The timer begins from the point the
      throttle is moved out of its start position.
  12. During flight secondary crew vigilantly monitors the Ground Station data (Voltage, forward
      velocity, altitude, and estimated remaining time to complete the mission) and relays any
      sudden changes or alerts to the pilot.
  13. As the mission completes the Pilot informs the secondary crew he is taking back over control.
  14. Secondary crew turns off the camera.
  15. Pilot begins to land the sUAS.
  16. After safely touching down the Pilot immediately goes and unplugs the main power. He then
      checks the pictures to verify if the pictures are good and the mission was successful.
  17. If successful secondary crew leaves to go pick up GCPs.
  18. Pilot checks battery voltage and records in battery log.
  19. Pilot records flight time in Flight Log.
  20. Pilot turns off both Tx, secondary GPS, and camera.
  21. Pilot looks over airframe to see if any damage or loose connections happened from the flight.
  22. Pilot begins to pack all equipment back up for safe transport.

      The flight crew will follow separate safety procedures for open mine surveying and for
natural gas well pad surveying.

      At the mine sites, the flight crew will check in at the security gate and go through a safety
inspection. The crew will meet a mine representative who serves as a liaison in directing any mine
personal and will have any dump trucks or bulldozers on the pile clear off before the crew begins
its survey. After the flight, the mine representative will inform any trucks and bulldozers that they
can begin operations again. (See Exhibit 1)

      At the well sites, the flight crew will unlock the security gate upon arrival and put on personal
protection equipment, which includes hard hats, safety glasses, flame resistant coveralls, and steel
toed boots. The crew then drives around the well pad site to inspect the flight area, set out ground

                                                          9
control points, and take land based photographs, and parks just outside of the well pad entrance.
(See Exhibit 2)

IV. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's prior consent
and knowledge. In addition, as the overflight areas will be rural, there is little to no chance that
there will be inhabited houses in the visual area or other people who have not consented to being
filmed or otherwise agreed to be in the area where filming will take place. No attempt will be made
to identify any individuals filmed during the flights except in cases where they are trespassing
upon or damaging customer property, or interfering with the applicant's or its customers'
operations.

V. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to
civil aircraft that have the characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These
limitations provide for at least an equivalent or higher level of safety to operations under the current
regulatory structure.

         These limitations and conditions to which Nixon Engineering Solutions, LLC agrees to be
bound when conducting commercial operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

  1. The sUAS will weigh less than 15 lbs.

  2. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and observer.

  3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 12 minutes. Flights will be
      terminated at 20% battery power reserve should that occur prior to the 12 minute limit.

  4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL. Despite this limitation,
      the majority of flights are anticipated to operate at no more than 270 feet AGL.

  5. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS pilot and the visual observer.

  6. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to each day's
      activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
      with the operations be present for this briefing.

  7. The operator will file any necessary paperwork in light of the exemptions with the
      appropriate Flight Standards District Office ("FSDO").

  8. The operator will submit a written Plan of Activities to the FSDO at least one day before the
      proposed operations begin.

  9. Pilot and observer will have been trained in operation of sUAS generally and received up-
      to-date information on the particular sUAS to be operated.

                                                         10
  10. Pilot and observer will at all times be able to communicate by voice and/or text.

  11. Written and/or oral permission from the relevant property holders will be obtained.

  12. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or city
      jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
      agencies.

  13. The sUAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
      emergencies.

  14. If the multirotor and its controller disconnects during flight, the system's failsafe protection
      will come to the rescue and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather
      than flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012--size, weight,
speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation within visual
line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the grant of the
requested exemptions allowing commercial operation of applicant's sUAS in the mining, oil, and
gas inspection industries pursuant to Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC's rules of operation
appended hereto.

VI. Public Interest and Safety

         Use of the sUAS will increase ground safety by eliminating ground surveying on the mine
floor and help prevent wildfires and exposure to H2S gas at the well pads, Currently, under safety
regulations by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the coal stockpiles are
surveyed by employees who walks on the piles with survey grade GPS collection equipment. This
task takes two employees several hours to complete.

         The surveyors currently face the following challenges:

    A. In the stockpiles:

         1. The piles are extremely steep and high ­ up to 100 feet above natural ground. The coal
             material of the piles is loose and shifts easily, which makes the sides of the piles very
             hazardous and can lead to unexpected coal slides, which endanger the workers.

         2. Inventories of coal piles are collected on a monthly basis. The coal has not been run
             through a crusher, and the size of the coal can range from dust to 5' chunks, which
             create a tripping hazard for people walking through the piles. Using the sUAS will
             eliminate tripping hazards to the surveyors.

         3. During August and September, the heat index routinely breaks 100ºF, which can lead
             to heat related illness and injury. Using the sUAS instead will reduce the risk of heat
             exhaustion to the surveyors as the time spent by the surveyors on the mine floor will
             be reduced from up to three hours, to an hour or less.

                                                         11
    B. In the well pads:

         1. Some of the stacks have the potential for high hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentrations,
             which can be extremely dangerous if inhaled because it is poisonous.

         2. There is a small, through real, chance for fires, and surveyors must wear flame resistant
             coveralls.

         3. During August and September, the heat index routinely breaks 100ºF, which can lead
             to heat related illness and injury. Using the sUAS instead will reduce the risk of heat
             exhaustion to the surveyors as the time spent by the surveyors on the mine floor will
             be reduced from up to three hours, to approximately an hour or less.

         By flying the sUAS over the coal piles, rather than putting workers on the mine floor, the
hazards stemming from these extreme conditions will be removed. Additionally, a sUAS can
complete the surveying task in under fifteen minutes, a drastic reduction in the time it takes the
two surveyors, who may otherwise spend three or more hours at a time in these conditions.
Inspections of the well pads made possible by the sUAS will reveal dangerous conditions,
including possible fires which have the potential to spread as wildfires, and may prevent serious
injury to employees.

VII. Regulations from Which Exemption is Requested

A. 14 C.F.R. 21(h): Airworthiness Certificates

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 21(h). This
exemption meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 based
on the small size, light weight, relatively slow speed, and use in controlled rural environments on
private land, as described previously in this petition.

B. 14 C.F.R. 43.7: Persons authorized to approve aircraft, airframes, aircraft engines,
         propellers, appliances, or component parts for return to service after maintenance,
         preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 43.7. This part
provides, inter alia, that the holder of a mechanic certificate or a repair station certificate may
approve an aircraft, airframe, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or component part for return to
service. The nature of the sUAS is that of a model aircraft, and the operators of Nixon Engineering
Solutions LLC who will maintain and when necessary repair the sUAS have engineering degrees;
one is a Professional Engineering and Land Surveyor and the other a licensed Engineer Intern. The
operators will conduct inspections and maintenance based on maintenance guidelines provided by
the manufacturer of the sUAS, DJI. (See Exhibits 3-7). The capabilities of these operators to
maintain and repair the sUAS will meet the requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant
to Section 333 for the type of sUAS, its intended use, and the rural operating environment.

C. 14 C.F.R. 43.11: Content, form, and disposition of records for inspections conducted
         under parts 91 and 125 and §§135.411(a)(1) and 135.419 of this chapter.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 43.11. This part
                                                         12
provides, inter alia, that maintenance record entries be maintained and for the listing of
discrepancies and placards by inspectors. The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room for
placards to be placed in or on it and no inspections for sUAS have been certified by FAA at the
present time. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions
LLC is willing to keep log books of all maintenance and repairs.

D. 14 C.F.R. 45.11: Marking of products.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.11. This part
provides, inter alia, that the manufacturers of aircraft, engines, propellers, mark such aircraft,
engines, or propellers with an approved fireproof identification plate. The sUAS, due to its small
size, does not have room for fireproof placards to be placed in it. Any required placards could
become hazardous, due to the additional weight and strain placed on the sUAS.

E. 14 C.F.R. 45.21: General.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.21. This part
provides, inter alia, that except as provided in §45.22, no person may operate a U.S.-registered
aircraft unless that aircraft displays nationality and registration marks in accordance with the
requirements of this section and §§45.23 through 45.33. There are no current procedures for
obtaining a registration mark for sUASs by the FAA. However, as a condition to the approval of
exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC is willing to be assigned a registration number and
to display it where practicable as addressed in this petition relative to Parts 23, 27, and 29, below.

F. 14 C.F.R. 45.23: Display of marks; general.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.11. This part
provides, inter alia, that each operator of an aircraft must display on that aircraft marks consisting
of the Roman capital letter "N" (denoting United States registration) followed by the registration
number of the aircraft. Moreover, limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental
or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near each
entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 6
inches high, the words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as
applicable.

         The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room to display aircraft marks in a
conventional size. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering
Solutions LLC is willing to affix an aircraft mark to one or more of the "arms" of the sUAS. The
size of the marking will be determined by the size of the "arm" being used and may be less than 1
inch in size.

         The word "Experimental" will be placed on the fuselage in compliance with §45.29(f).
However, a partial exemption from this display regulation may be needed as the UAS will have
no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the word "Experimental" can be placed.
Given the size of the sUAS, two-inch lettering will be impossible.

         The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the sUAS marked on its fuselage
as required by §45.29 (f) where the pilot, observer and others working with the sUAS will see the
identification of the UAS as "Experimental." The requested exemption is consistent with the

                                                         13
following exemptions to this regulation that the FAA has issued: Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738,
10167 and 10167A.

G. 14 C.F.R. 45.25: Location of marks on fixed-wing aircraft

         The sUAS is a multirotor model aircraft and is not fixed-wing. Therefore, 14 C.F.R. 45.25
is inapplicable.

H. 14 C.F.R. 45.27: Location of marks; nonfixed-wing aircraft

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.27. This part
provides, inter alia, that each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that rotorcraft horizontally
on both surfaces of the cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail the marks required by §45.23. The sUAS,
due to its small size, does not have a cabin, fuselage, boom or tail to display the marks required by
§45.23.

I. 14 C.F.R. 45.29: Size of marks

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.27. This part
provides, inter alia, at subpart (3) that the registration marks for rotorcraft must be at least 12 inches
high. The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have any surface area large enough to display marks
anywhere near 12 inches high. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon
Engineering Solutions LLC is willing to affix an aircraft mark to one or more of the "arms" of the
sUAS. The size of the marking will be determined by the size of the "arm" being used and may be
less than 1 inch in size.

J. 14 C.F.R. 47.3(b)(2): Registration required

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 47.3(b)(2). This
part provides "(b) No person may operate an aircraft that is eligible for registration under 49 U.S.C.
44101-44104, unless the aircraft--(1) Has been registered by its owner; [or] (2) Is carrying aboard
the temporary authorization required by §47.31(c)."

         There are no current procedures for obtaining a registration mark for sUASs by the FAA.
However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC is willing
to be assigned a registration number provided by FAA and to display it where practicable as
addressed in this petition relative to Parts 23, 27, and 29, above.

K. 14 C.F.R. 47.31(c): Application

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R.47.31 (c). This
part provides "(c) After compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant for registration
of an aircraft last previously registered in the United States must carry the second copy of the
Aircraft Registration Application in the aircraft as temporary authority to operate without
registration."

         Because FAA currently has no process for registering sUAS, it is impossible to comply
with Part 47.31(a), which states, inter alia: "(a) Each applicant for a Certificate of Aircraft

                                                         14
Registration, AC Form 8050-3 must submit the following to the Registry: (1) An Aircraft
Registration Application, AC Form 8050-1, signed by the applicant in the manner prescribed by
§47.13; (2) The original Aircraft Bill of Sale, AC Form 8050-2, or other evidence of ownership
authorized by §47.33, §47.35, or §47.37 (unless already recorded at the Registry)."

L. 14 C.F.R. § 61.113: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 61.113. The PIC
(pilot in command) of the sUAS does not possess either a private or commercial license. However,
because (i) the sUAS is essentially a model aircraft, weighs less than 15 lbs. including payload,
and will not carry any pilot or passengers, (ii) the area of operation is controlled and restricted,
(iii) all flights will be planned and coordinated in advance, and (iv) the maximum altitude of the
sUAS will not exceed 400 feet AGL, the proposed operations will achieve the equivalent level of
safety of current operations by manned aircraft with a private or commercial pilots license.

         The level of safety provided by Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC meets or exceeds that
provided by an individual possessing a private or commercial pilot's license operating a manned
aircraft. For conducting safe sUAS operations it is more important for the PIC of the sUAS be
experienced, particularly with the sUAS at issue, than for the PIC to have a pilot's license. The
PICs operating under this exemption will be experienced. Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will
have an operator (PIC) who has 1.5 years of radio control aircraft experience and has flown nearly
150 flights on this particular sUAS, and therefore meets or exceeds the present level of safety
envisioned under this Section.

         Stated another way, the skill set needed to successfully and safely operate the UAS is very
different from the set of skills needed by a pilot of manned aircraft. Both FAA and Army Research
Laboratory research demonstrate that UAS, even those much larger than the sUAS proposed by
Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC, can be safely flown by non-certificated pilots with a small
amount of training.

         As one Army Research Laboratory study stated:

         "[T]he specific motor skills needed to control the radio-controlled UAV would
         have to be learned by aviators independently of the motor skills learned in
         flying an aircraft. In particular, the somatic and visual cues that pilots use
         during aircraft landings would not be useful (and perhaps even counter-
         productive) for the different skill sets and perceptual viewpoint necessary for
         radio-controlled landings." Michael J. Barnes, Beverly G. Knapp, Barry W.
         Tillman, Brett A. Walters & Darlene Veliki, Crew systems analysis of unmanned
         aerial vehicle (UAV) future job and tasking environments, Technical Report ARL-
         TR-2081, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: Army Research Laboratory, page 12
         (2000). (See Exhibit 8)

         In addition to the above research by the Army Research Laboratory, additional research
reports lend further support for the exclusion requested, including one sponsored by the FAA and
the other sponsored by the Institute of Aviation, Aviation Human Factors Division, at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign:

    DOT/FAA/AM-07/3, FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, page 2, (2007), available at
    http://fas.org/irp/program/collect/ua-pilot.pdf.

         "We know that certain systems, like the U.S. Army Hunter and Shadow
         systems, are successfully flown by pilots with no manned aircraft experience."2
         (See Exhibit 9).

2. Jason S. McCarley & Christopher D. Wickens, Human Factors Implications of UAVs in the

    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 13 (2004), available at
    http://www.tc.faa.gov/logistics/grants/pdf/2004/04-G-032.pdf, citing Barnes, supra.

         "Using the Army's Job Assessment Software System (JASS), Barnes, et al
         (2000) elicited Hunter UAV operators ratings of the relative importance of
         various cognitive skills in UAV air vehicle operators. Ratings indicated that
         outside of communication skills, raters did not consider flight-related skills of
         great importance to UAV operations, leading the authors to conclude that
         selection of rated aviators as air vehicle operators would be of little value."
         (See Exhibit 10).

         Finally, if the agency concludes that the PIC qualifications proposed in this exemption
request do not meet the interim standards it is implementing, it should not deny the application on
that ground. Rather, it should grant the exemption subject to Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC
meeting whatever interim PIC qualifications the agency has adopted in other Section 333
exemption proceedings. For example, the pending exemption petitions of NextEra Energy, Inc.,
Oceaneering International, Inc., and Aeryon Labs, Inc., have already raised the PIC qualification
issue. Applicant would be willing to adhere to the PIC qualification policies established in any of
those proceedings.

M. 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a). The
regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition.
As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft should this exemption be
granted, no standard will exist for determining airworthiness. Given the size and weight of the
aircraft and the requirements contained in Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC's rules of operations,
described above, for maintenance and use of safety check lists prior to each flight, an equivalent
level of safety will be provided.

N. 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard
         requirements.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2). This
part provides:

2 While the authors speculated that UAV use in populated areas may change this assessment,
indicating further research was needed to address this concern, this concern is inapplicable as
Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC's flights will be in unpopulated areas.

                                                         16
         "(b) No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft...

         (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
         this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved Airplane or
         Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
         any combination thereof."

         First, there does not currently exist a method of approving manuals for sUAS. Second,
given the size and configuration of the sUAS, there is no space to carry such a flight manual on
the aircraft. In addition, carrying the manual on the aircraft would be pointless, since there is no
pilot or other person on board who could read or use it. The equivalent ­ and in fact a greater -
level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the ground control point where
the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to it. The FAA has issued the following
similar exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565,
9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and 10700.

O. 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c). This part
provides: "(c) No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft unless that aircraft is identified
in accordance with part 45 of this chapter."

         As stated above, there is no current registration process for sUAS; and the sUAS, due to
its small size, does not have room to contain fireproof placard or to display aircraft marks in a
conventional size. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering
Solutions LLC is willing to affix an aircraft mark to one or more of the "arms" of the sUAS. The
size of the marking will be determined by the size of the "arm" being used and may be less than 1
inch in size.

P. 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2): Preflight action.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2).
This part provides:

         "Each pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all
         available information concerning that flight. This information must include--... (b)
         For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following takeoff
         and landing distance information: ... (2) For civil aircraft other than those specified
         in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, other reliable information appropriate to the
         aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under expected values of airport elevation
         and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and temperature."

         The Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC pilot in command in fact will, before beginning a
flight, become familiar with all available information concerning that flight. However, as the
flights of the sUAS will not be at airports the information required of Part 91.103(b)(2) does not
apply. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC
shall perform preflight operations as outlined previously in this Petition.

                                                         17
Q. 14 C.F.R. 91.105: Flight crewmembers at stations.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.105 since this
part is not applicable due to the sUAS carrying no flight crewmembers. However, to achieve an
equivalent level of safety, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will not operate the aircraft unless
someone is at the controls at all times.

R. 14 C.F.R. 91.109: Flight instruction; Simulated instrument flight and certain flight
         tests.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.109. This part
provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that is being
used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls. Remotely piloted
aircraft, including the sUAS here, are designed and constructed without dual controls. Flight
control will be accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft
via radio communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training without fully
functional dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in experimental aircraft.
See Exemption Nos.5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of safety is provided by the very limited
size and speed of the aircraft and by the fact that neither a pilot nor passengers will be carried in
the aircraft.

S. 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b): Right-of-way rules: Except water operations.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 113(b) to the
extent that it applies to overhead aircraft operating at or above 500 feet AGL as the sUAS will be
operating no higher than 400 feet AGL. This part provides:

         "(b): General. When weather conditions permit, regardless of whether an operation
         is conducted under instrument flight rules or visual flight rules, vigilance shall be
         maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft.
         When a rule of this section gives another aircraft the right-of-way, the pilot shall
         give way to that aircraft and may not pass over, under, or ahead of it unless well
         clear."

         For example, if another aircraft is operating overhead at 10,000 feet AGL there is no danger
posed to that other aircraft if the sUAS is operating under it or ahead of it at or beneath 400 feet
AGL. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC
will operate its sUAS to see and avoid and give way to other aircraft that should enter airspace at
or below 400 feet AGL.

T. 14 C.F.R. 91.115: Right-of-way rules: water operations.

         This Part does not apply as Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC does not plan on operations
on or over bodies of water in the near future.

U. 14 C.F.R. 91.119(b) and (c): Minimum safe altitudes: General.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.119 subparts
(b) and (c). This regulation provides:

                                                         18
         "Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft
         below the following altitudes:...

         (b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or
         over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest
         obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.

         (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface,
         except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may
         not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure."

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will not operate the sUAS any higher than 400 feet
AGL. Furthermore, while Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will not be operating over any
congested areas, the sUAS will necessarily be flown closer to 500 feet to the structures it will be
examining (as well as closer than 500 feet to the ground).

         The operations by Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC of the sUAS as set out previously
provide for at least an equivalent level of safety of manned aircraft maintaining a distance of at
least "500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure" due to the small size and relatively light
weight of the sUAS; and the close monitoring of the flight by both the pilot in command and the
secondary ground crewmember.

V. 14 C.F.R. 91.121: Altimeter Settings

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.121. This Part
provides guidelines for altimeter use below 18,000 feet mean sea level ("MSL") in maintaining
the cruising altitude or flight level of the aircraft. Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC's operation of
the sUAS will not exceed 400 feet AGL and will be operated in a fashion that is not a sustained
cruising flight such as a manned aircraft will typically fly. The laptop used in the ground station
has live feedback information about the sUAS, including but not limited to the height of the sUAS,
its forward velocity, and compass heading. The operator will be able to observe and control the
maximum height of the sUAS. Additionally, the sUAS will be operated within the line of sight.
Therefore, the equivalent level of safety provided by Section 91.121 will be met.

W. 14 C.F.R. 91.151: Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.

        Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. Part 91.151. This
Part provides that:

         "(a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
         the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed-- (1)
         During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after
         that for at least 45 minutes

         (b) No person may begin a flight in a rotorcraft under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
         the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly after

                                                         19
         that for at least 20 minutes."

         The sUAS Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will fly is electric in nature, using lithium
polymer batteries that currently have a flight limit of approximately no more than 15 minutes.
Therefore, due to the limitations of the batteries it is currently impossible to comply with Part
91.151. However, the sUAS will be operated in a manner with at least the same equivalent of
safety as that of a manned aircraft complying with Part 91.151 because the short distances the
sUAS will be operated in, far less than one mile, will allow the sUAS to be flown to a safe landing
point within the area of operation within a short period of time and well within the minimum level
of reserve capacity of the batteries.

         During the entire preprogrammed flight, the operator will always have a visual line of sight
and be prepared to take over. Pilot's radio transmitter ("Tx") has a flight count down timer which
is set to a minimum of 20% battery reserve defined as allowing an additional 3 minutes of flight
time - more than enough to safely fly the sUAS back to the roped off "home" area. This operation
procedure adequately complies with ASTM standard F3005 - 14 4.3.1 (Standard Specification for
Batteries for Use in Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS)). The timer begins from the point
the throttle is moved out of its start position.

         The battery powering the sUAS provides approximately 15 minutes of powered flight. As
a result, the sUAS would never meet the 30 minute reserve requirement. Given the limitations on
the sUAS's proposed flight area and the location of its proposed operations within a predetermined
area, a longer time frame for flight in daylight VFR conditions is reasonable.

         Applicant believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) falls within the scope of
prior exemptions. See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate
without compliance with Section 91.151 (a)). Given the limited size and speed of the sUAS, its
ability to land safely almost anywhere, that it will be under the operator and the observer's visual
observation at all times, and that it will be operating in a tightly controlled area, where all people,
other than the operator and the observer, will be removed before flight, permitting its operation
with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel does not engender the type of risks that Section 91.151(a)
was intended to alleviate.

         Applicant believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to
12 minutes or the time when 20% of battery power remains, whichever happens first. This
restriction would be more than adequate to allow the sUAS to reach its planned landing zone.
Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689F, 5745,
10673, and 10808.

X. 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b): Civil aircraft: Certifications required.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and
(b). This section provides in part:

         "(a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it
         has within it the following:

         (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

                                                         20
         (2) An effective U.S. registration certificate issued to its owner...

         (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate
         required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued
         under § 91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to
         passengers or crew."

         First, there are currently no procedures by the FAA for providing airworthiness certificates
for sUAS. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, Nixon Engineering Solutions
LLC will display on the sUAS a registration certificate or equivalent that is issued by FAA
pursuant to this petition at the ground point control, where the operator will have immediate access
to them.

         Second, the sUAS Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will use the DJI S800 EVO or
similar, which has an equivalent level of safety as manned aircraft with an airworthiness certificate.
The DJI A2 flight controller provides a number of safety features in addition to acting as the
command and control Rx bound to the Futaba brand Tx, including automatic return to home if the
radio control link is broken, referred to as a failsafe.

         Because of the use of GPS with the sUAS, the operator will set the initial location of flight
takeoff ("home position") and if the radio control link is broken, the A2 flight controller will
recognize this broken control link and cause the sUAS to automatically return to the home position
as recorded by the GPS instrumentation. Additionally, because the sUAS team will mark off an
area with traffic cones that has a 20 ft. radius, approximately 30 ft. from the operators that will be
used as the "home position" for the sUAS to return, no one will be standing in the way of the path.
(See Exhibits 1, 2).

         In the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed, operation of the sUAS
will be at least as safe as a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed. Nixon Engineering
Solutions LLC will not accept assignments from clients who are within 5 miles of controlled
airspace without first gaining written and/or oral permission from air traffic control.

         The sUAS to be operated hereunder is less than 15 pounds inclusive of batteries and
technical payload, carries neither a pilot nor passengers, and carries no explosive materials or
flammable liquid fuels. The sUASs operating under this exemption will be tightly controlled and
monitored by the operator and the observer, and under the requirements and in compliance with
local public safety requirements, to provide security for the area of operation. The FAA will have
advance notice of all operations. These safety enhancements provide a greater degree of safety to
the public and property owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness
certificates issued under Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria demonstrates that
there is no credible threat to national security posed by the UAS, due to its size, speed of operation,
location of operation, lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry
a substantial payload.

Y. 14 C.F.R. 91.215: ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use

         This section requires that installed Air Traffic Control (ATC) transponder equipment must
meet specific performance and environmental requirements, and aircraft must be equipped with an

                                                         21
operable coded radar beacon transponder.

         There are presently no known commercially available ATC transponders that meet the
payload requirements of a sUAS and are available at reasonable cost. However, because the sUASs
used by Nixon Engineering will not be flying into or near airports, and will fly no higher than 400
feet AGL, there is very low risk of collision with any manned aircraft. In addition, because there
will be no need to have contemporaneous communication with Air Traffic Control, due to the short
distances, short flight times, and restricted altitude the sUASs will operate within, Nixon
Engineering requests an exemption from this section. Additionally, the sUAS is too small to
contain ATC transponder equipment in any form factor that is known to be available commercially.

Z. 14 C.F.R. 91.403: General

         This section requires that the owner or operator of an aircraft is primarily responsible for
maintaining that aircraft in an airworthy condition. Nixon Engineering will adhere to this
requirement. However, this Section also limits maintenance to that "prescribed in this subpart and
other applicable regulations, including part 43 of this chapter." Because of this limitation, and
because of the exemptions under Part 43 requested above, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC
requests an exemption from this Section.

         This exemption meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section
333 based on the small size, light weight, relatively slow speed, and use in controlled rural
environments on private, secured land, as described previously in this petition.

AA. 14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a) and (d): Maintenance Required

         This section requires that aircraft be inspected as proscribed by Section E, 14 C.F.R.
§§91.401-91.421. As shown below, Nixon Engineering LLC is applying for an exemption for these
sections, due to the fact that its operators will inspect the sUAS prior to each flight and keep
maintenance records of all parts that are replaced. Because the Sections discussed below are
concerned with manned aircraft, and as such have inspection requirements designed for the safety
of passengers, they are inapplicable to Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC is also applying for an exemption to subpart (d) of this
section, which requires a placard to be installed and references §43.11. As noted previously, Nixon
Engineering Solutions LLC requests an exemption to the placard requirement, because, due to the
small size of the sUAS, there is no room to place the placard. As an alternative and to achieve an
equivalent level of safety, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will keep logbooks detailing all
repairs.

         Despite the requested exemption from subparts (a) and (d) of this section, Nixon
Engineering Solutions LLC will follow subparts (b) and (c) of this subpart.

BB. 14 C.F.R. 91.407: Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,
         or alteration

         This section requires that any aircraft which "has undergone maintenance, preventative
maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration unless . . . [i]t has been approved for return to service by a
person authorized under § 43.7 of this chapter . . .."

                                                         22
         However, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC has requested an exemption from §§ 43.7 and
43.11 as described previously. The capability of the operators to maintain and repair the sUAS
meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 for both the type
of sUAS, its intended use, and the rural operating environment. Additionally, due to the small size
of the sUAS, there is no room to place inspection placards.

         Therefore, because Nixon Engineering Solutions has requested an exemption from 43.7
and 43.11, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC respectfully requests an exemption from 91.407. To
achieve an equivalent level of safety, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will regularly inspect and
maintain its sUASs in accordance with the DJI operator manual, and keep detailed inspection
records as described above.

CC. 14 C.F.R. 91.409: Inspections

         This section lays out the requirements for inspections of aircraft. Nixon Engineering
Solutions LLC respectfully requests an exemption from these requirements because they are
intended to maintain the safety of manned aircraft significantly larger and capable of significantly
longer flights than the DJI S800.

         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC does have an inspection procedure. Prior to each flight,
the operator will conduct an inspection of the sUAS. The steps of this pre-flight inspection include:

                   Check the following proponents for damage during transport:
                      o Airframe;
                      o Connections; and
                      o Propellers.

                   Calibrate the camera.
                   Verify voltage and settings for main flight Tx and the gimbal Tx.
                   Measure voltage for dual battery.
                   Cycle through different control modes of the Flight Tx observing LED lights

                      for good connection and response.
                   Cycle through all controls of the Gimbal Tx making sure the gimbal and camera

                      respond to commands.
                   Activate engine power without moving throttle up to check that the automatic

                      throttle kill works.

         After each flight, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will conduct the following post-flight
inspection:

              Blow sUAS with compressed air to remove dirt and dust.
              Wipe down sUAS with a cloth to remove dirt and dust.
              Check each electrical connection to make sure it is still intact.

         The pre-flight and post-flight inspections meet or exceed the level of safety achieved by
adherence to 14 C.F.R. 91.409.

                                                         23
DD. 14 C.F.R. 91.417: Maintenance records
         Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC respectfully requests an exemption from this Section,

as it is only applicable for aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. Because Nixon Engineering
Solutions LLC will not have an airworthiness certificate, this Section is inapplicable. As an
alternative and to achieve an equivalent level of safety, Nixon Engineering Solutions LLC will
keep detailed maintenance on every part as it is replaced, including but not limited to propellers,
batteries, and electrical components.

                                                         24
                    Exhibit 1: Mine Procedures

Location:

The Dolet Hills Lignite Mine is located in Desoto Parish, LA. The mine property is
approximately 10.5 miles long and nearly 4 miles wide or approximately 24,000 acres, all
privately owned. The closest town or city to the property is Mansfield, LA and it is
approximately 5 miles as measured from the closest point on Google Earth. This is an extremely
rural area. According to the 2010 census, the population density of Desoto Parish is 29 people
per square mile and the total population is 32,000. The primary land use of the Parish and more
particularly the area in and around the mine is timber farming. The closest airfield is the
Mansfield Airfield (an uncontrolled airfield), which is approximately 8.5 miles to the closest
point of the mine property. All of the property is in Class G airspace. Finally, all of the property
is fenced off and has manned and secured gates which restrict public access.

The Oxbow Mine is located in the adjacent Red River Parish. The Oxbow mine is not quite as
large approximately, 3 miles long by 2 miles wide. The closest community is Coushatta, LA and
it is approximately 2.5 miles east across the Red River. Again the area is extremely rural; the
population density is 25 people per square mile, and the Parish has a total population of 9,091
according to the 2010 census. The topography of Red River Parish is different than Desoto
Parish due to the Red River. Therefore the primary land uses around the mine are different and
consist primarily of pasture land and farming. The closest airfield is Red River, a small
uncontrolled runway approximately 4 miles from the closest point of the mine property. All of
the property is in Class G airspace. Similar to the Dolet Hills Mine, the property is fenced off,
with restricted access and manned security guards at the gates.

Purpose of Flight:

The primary purpose of the work is to safely, accurately, and efficiently create 3D surface
models of stockpiles and the natural ground surface. This is done using a sUAS to collect
photogrammetric pictures, survey equipment to set ground control points, and specialized
photogrammetry software to process the data.

Flight Crew, Equipment and Typical Flight:

         For information regarding the flight crew, equipment, and typical flight, please refer to
pages six and seven of the petition, above.

Current Methods:

Currently these stockpiles are surveyed with a man walking around on the piles with survey
grade GPS collection equipment. These piles are extremely steep and very high (100ft above
natural ground). The coal material of these piles is loose and shifts easily can the sides can be
very hazardous. By flying the piles using a sUAS this hazard is removed. Further the sUAS can
do the work in under 15 minutes which previously took two men multiple hours to do. In August
and September when the heat index routinely breaks 100° this limits the exposure of people to
those extreme conditions.

                    25
           Exhibit 2: Natural Gas Well Pad Procedures

Location:

These locations are spread across the Haynesville Shale Natural Gas play, encompassing
Portions of Desoto, Red River, Caddo, and Bossier Parishes. The well pads are all located in
rural areas of these parishes. The primary land use in and around all of these wells is farming,
pasture and timber. All of the wells we survey are in Class G airspace. Finally, the wells pads are
fenced off and secured with no public access.

Purpose of Flight:

The primary purpose of the work is to safely, accurately, and efficiently create as-built survey
maps of the completed well heads, tanks, secondary containment walls, compressors and other
miscellaneous equipment on the well pad. These as-built maps are comprised of 3D surface
models and high resolution aerial photos. The work is done using a sUAS to collect
photogrammetric pictures, survey equipment to set ground control points, and specialized
photogrammetry software to process the data.

Flight Crew, Equipment and Typical Flight:

         For information regarding the flight crew, equipment, and typical flight, please refer to
pages six and seven of the petition, above.

Current Methods:

Currently these well pads are surveyed by a surveyor walking and taking shots over the entire
pad, along with taking shots on the equipment. Some of these well pads have the potential for
high H2S concentrations around certain areas of the pad. High concentrations of H2S can be
extremely dangerous if inhaled. There is also a small (though real) chance for a well fire. Further
the sUAS can do the work in under 15 minutes which previously took two men multiple hours to
do. In August and September when the heat index routinely breaks 100° and you are wearing
flame resistant coveralls this reduced exposure to the extreme heat is the most appreciated safety
mitigation.

                                                           is converting the PWM signal from
                                                           traditional receiver to S-BUS signal.

Notes for the traditional receiver users:
 When using the traditional receiver which doesn't have endpoint adjustment operations to set

        FailSafe in the U channel, the Go-Home switch is recommended and users can use it to trigger
        the FailSafe.
 Configure the FailSafe function of your transmitter and receiver according to its instructions,
        set the FailSafe position of the Go-Home switch in the position triggering the FailSafe function.
        If it is configured correctly as mentioned above, the FailSafe function will be activated
        automatically if the receiver loses the signal from the transmitter.
 Users can get more information about the FailSafe function referring to 3.1 FailSafe in this
        manual and the help text in the Assistant software.

1.3 Compass Calibration

  The Compass can assistant the GPS to position the aircraft, which is very important during flight. As we know,
  the compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference, which will cause abnormal compass data, and lead
  to poor flight performance or even flight failure. Compass Calibration MUST be done for first time use.
  It is recommended to calibrate the compass outdoors after the Controller Unit finds 7 or more GPS satellites.
  Regular calibration enables the compass to keep optimal performance.

Calibration Cautions

          (1) DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is strong magnetic interference, such as magnetite,
                   car park, and steel reinforcement under the ground.

          (2) DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration, such as keys or cell phones.
          (3) Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system cannot work.

3 Protection Functions Setting

Set protection in the Assistant software ->Advanced page. FailSafe and Low voltage protections are required.

3.1 FailSafe

  FailSafe works when the Transmitter (TX) signal is lost, the flight control system will automatically control the
  aircraft to reduce injuries or damage.

           TX                                              Descriptions

Point
 (HP)                       Motors have been started; auto-record the position as home point at the first time

                            the throttle stick is raised.

                            Flight control system can automatically control the aircraft after Transmitter signal is

FailSafe              lost. It should be set in Assistant software->Advanced->F/S, while Hover, Go-Home or
                  6 Alt Go-Home is optional. Additionally, a Go-Home switch can be enabled.

                            Go Home switch can be used to trigger a "go home" without FailSafe. If One-Key

One-Key                     Go Home is enabled during flying, you no longer have control of the aircraft, the LED
Go Home
                            blinks in its Control Mode. If One-Key Go Home is disabled, you regain the control at

                            once. If already in a FailSafe condition, then the switch will not work.

(1) The aircraft will not go home (only attitude stabilizing) in the condition that    <6 or GPS is not

          working, even if Transmitter signal is lost or Go Home switch is triggered.

(2) It is recommended to set the Go Home switch in the Assistant software. Users are suggested to

          enter FailSafe and go home by using the Go Home switch rather than turning off the Transmitter

          in emergency situations.

Regain control

                      once to regain control if the signal recovers.

3.2 Low Voltage Protection

  Low voltage protection is used to alert low battery voltage during flight; in this case, users should promptly fly
  back the aircraft and land to avoid unexpected damages.
  To use this function please set in Assistant software->Advanced->Voltage page to configure two voltage levels.

Go-Home & Landing Usage Tips
  (1) The home point recorded is the same in both FailSafe and Low voltage protection. The aircraft will not go
          home in the following cases :
           a) Control mode switch is at the position-3 (Manual Mode or ATTI. Mode)

           b) GPS signal is bad ( <6)
           c) The distance between aircraft and the home point is less than 25m, and the height over the Home

                   point less than 20m.

Descending Usage Tips
  The aircraft will not hover when the throttle stick is at the mid point. Push the throttle stick to 90% of its
  endpoint, the aircraft will still ascend slowly if you continue to pull the throttle stick, and the control of Pitch,
  Roll and Yaw are the same as before.

             (1) Please pay attention to the LED alert of low voltage and make sure the power is enough for go
                     home and landing. Insufficient power reserve will cause the aircraft to crash as well as other
                     consequences.

             (2) If the second level low voltage alert occurs in below procedures, the aircraft will descend
                     automatically.
                     a) When the aircraft is in FailSafe and Go Home process
                     b) When the aircraft is controlled by the Ground Station.

Step 2 Forward Direction, HP and POI Recording

After you enable the IOC in assistant software, the flight control system will record the forward direction and home

point automatically after power on, if the recording conditions are met. You can Manually re-record the forward

direction, home point and POI during flying. Read the following table for the recording method details.

(1) DO NOT toggle the switch between the position 1 and 3 frequently, which may re-record the
        position 2.

(2) The new Home Point and Forward Direction can be set only after one has already been recorded
        automatically.

(3) HP is not only used in IOC, but also in FailSafe and Low voltage as go home and landing
        destination. The flight control system will automatically record the HP even if IOC function is
        disabled in Assistant software but Forward direction and POI can be recorded only after IOC is
        enabled.

(4) Once the Home Point is recorded successfully, LED will blink (6) continually under the
        following conditions. All conditions must be true.

        1. 7.
        2. Distance between aircraft and the recorded home point is less than 8m.
        3. Current control mode is in GPS ATTI. Mode or ATTI. Mode of switch position-2.

        DO NOT toggle the IOC switch frequently in HL flying to avoid re-recording the HP unwittingly.

        IOC function is available only when all the required conditions are satisfied. If any condition is omitted
        the flight control system will exit IOC. Please keep an eye on the LED to know the current control mode.

        (1) It's recommended to start the HL flight when the aircraft is >10m away from the HP. If starting
                the HL when the distance between aircraft and HP is less than 10m and it's the first time you
                start HL after power on, then the flight control system will only enter HL after flying out of the
                10m range.

        (2) During HL flying if one of the following conditions occur, the flight control system will exit HL and
                enter into CL: the aircraft is within of 10m from HP; the control mode is changed to ATTI. Mode;

                     <6(LED (2) or (3)).

4.2 Servo Gimbal function

  Connect the servos of your gimbal to the Controller Unit as the fig. belowroll servo connects to F3 port and
     pitch servo connects to F2, and configure in Advanced->Gimbal page in the Assistant software. No Receiver
     channel is asked to be mapped for the F2 or F3 port if gimbal function is enabled in the Assistant Software.

  Note: Even you map Receiver channels to F3 and F2 (Which are shown as D3 and D2 in the Assistant Software
     -> Channel Mapping), the F3 and F2 will not give output signals from the mapped Receiver channels.

                              F2  Pitch
                       Roll

                   F3

4.3 Gear function

Once enable the Intelligent Gear function, the gear is default down on the ground or in case of emergency (e.g.
motor failure tolerance, auto landing); you can control it to be up or down by a switch when the aircraft altitude
is above 5m during flight.
Please configure in the Advanced->Gear page in the Assistant software. Connect the landing gear of S800 EVO
to the Controller Unit as fig. below.

(1) Make sure to enable and configure the Intelligent Gear function in the Assistant software first,
        and then connect the gear to the F1 port.

(2) The Gear channel is required to be mapped with a channel on Receiver if the Intelligent Gear
        function is enabled in Assistant Software, and the F1 port will give outputs for retracting control.

(3) Once you map the Gear channel, F1 port will give output signals from the controller for retract
        control. Otherwise, even the Intelligent Gear function is enabled; F1 will give output from D1 (it's
        necessary to map the D1 channel with a channel on Receiver as your demands).

4.4 Attitude Control When One Motor Output Fails

  For Hexa-rotor, including Hexa-rotor I, Hexa-rotor V, Hexa-rotor IY and Hexa-rotor Y, the aircraft with A2 flight
  control system is attitude controllable when one motor output fails.

             Select Course lock or home lock mode for flying the aircraft into a safe area to land when the aircraft is
             far away or the attitude can't be recognized.

Abstract

          The purpose of the research project was to understand the future crew
          environments for developing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. A
          variety of human engineering tools (job assessment software system [JASS],
          enhanced computer-aided testing [ECAT], and MicroSaintTM) were used to
          address crew issues related to the utility of having rated aviators as crew
          members, supplementing current crews with imagery and intelligence
          specialists, and the use of automation to improve systems efficiency. Data
          from 70 soldiers and experts from Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Fort Hood, Texas,
          and Hondo, Texas, were collected as part of this effort. The general finding
          was that the use of cognitive methods and computerized tool sets to
          understand future crew environments proved to be cost effective and useful.
          Specifically, no evidence was found to support a requirement for rated
          aviators in future Army missions, but the use of cognitively oriented
          embedded training simulators was suggested to aid novices in developing the
          cognitive skills evinced by experts. The efficacy of adding imagery specialists
          to 96U crews was discussed, and specific recommendations related to
          automation were derived from the workload modeling.

INTRODUCTION

         Future battle spaces will be exploited by a variety of aerial and ground platforms to help
U.S. forces achieve information dominance. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) family of
platforms will increase the range, survivability, and effectiveness of this effort. The purpose of
this ongoing research is to understand the crew environment and soldier performance issues
related to future UAV systems. Specifically, three major issues were addressed: (a) the
importance of using rated aviators for piloting positions for the UAV, (b) the use of imagery
specialists and intelligence analysts (96D and 96B military occupational specialty [MOS]) as
adjunct crew members, and (c) the potential use of automation to assist in future crew functions.
The variety of questions asked required the use of numerous human engineering and human
performance data collection methods.

         A secondary motivation was to investigate the effectiveness of available tool sets and
methodologies to understand human job and mission environments for developing systems. The
best way to test the mettle of these approaches was by attacking important problems of developing
systems rather than by investigating laboratory problems of dubious validity. The UAV was an
ideal candidate because of its crew-intensive mission profiles (Barnes & Matz, 1998) and the need
to investigate the crew issues perceived by the Training and Doctrine System Manager (TSM).
The TSM's cooperation was absolutely essential in completing this study; in providing direction,
expertise, and a sense of priorities; and because a significant investment of the TSM personnel's
own time and effort was required during the data collection and analysis portions. The overall
study was extensive, including the efforts of more than 70 participants representing expertise from
the aviation, intelligence, and UAV communities of Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Fort Hood, Texas,
and the contractors in Hondo, Texas, who engineered the Outrider UAV.

RATED AVIATORS

         The use of rated aviators as part of the UAV crew was deemed the most crucial issue
addressed. The problem is complicated because of the safety, training, and selection issues

                                                                            3
involved. In the UAV crew, two flight positions were examined: the internal pilot (designated
air vehicle operator [AVO]) and the external pilot (EP). The AVO for current Hunter UAV
configuration resides in the ground control station (GCS) seated next to the mission payload
operator (MPO). The AVO coordinates with the mission commander to do mission planning,
assumes flight control of the air vehicle after take-off, and sets the course to the various way
points. The AVO must be able to read flight instruments and understand the current flight status
but does not usually fly the air vehicle in the sense that a fixed or rotary wing aviator does.
Instead, the AVO directs the UAV to a target location and upon arrival, coordinates with the
MPO who executes the best search pattern over the target area. The AVO also responds to flight
emergencies and makes course changes for tactical or safety reasons. However, most of the
initial "hands-on" control of the air vehicle is done by the EP who flies the UAV during take-off
and landing using a control device similar to that used for radio-controlled model airplanes. It is
important to note that most flight safety problems occur during the EP's watch; this is not a
result of any characteristic of the EP; rather, it reflects the dangers associated with take-off and
landing for any air vehicle.

Method

         Procedure
                 Four analyses were performed to determine the important cognitive skills required

for the AVO and EP positions and to relate them to safety-of-flight issues. Although data were
collected for all flight functions for both categories, the main focus was on flight functions
clearly related to air vehicle accidents and incidents.

                  Using the job assessment software system (JASS), the authors collected ratings
from UAV AVOs and EPs regarding the importance of an array of cognitive skills to their jobs
and tasks. Data were collected from flight-rated U.S. Army aviators to contrast the cognitive
skills they reported as particularly important with skills reported by the UAV EPs.

                  Subsequent analysis indicated that JASS data painted an incomplete picture; it
became obvious that more was needed to be known about the relationship between reported
cognitive skill levels and actual mishaps. One source of information concerning the relationship
of performance and skill level was the training experiences at the UAV Flight School at Fort
Huachuca. JASS data were supplemented with enhanced computer-aided testing (ECAT) data
from a pilot study collected by Hopson (1995). This study correlated the ECAT scores on one-
and two-handed tracking scores with failure rate for the EP training course. In addition, the
UAV flight incident report results were compared to the JASS flight tasks, which permitted us
to focus our analysis on critical flight functions (TSM, 1998).

                  Finally, data interpretation proved to be a difficult problem. Besides the
relationship of tasks to skill levels, there were operational, programmatic, and experiential issues
as well as similar investigations by other services to consider in attempting to forge a position on
rated aviators from the raw data. To address these issues, a subject matter expert (SME) working
session was convened on 15 October 1998 at Fort Huachuca in order to help interpret the data
(see list of participants in Appendix A).

         Participants

                  For the JASS data collection, a total of 30 96U soldiers or Hunter-trained
contractors was tested during the exercise. There were 21 MPO and AVO designations, 11 of
whom provided JASS data from a primarily AVO task structure and 10 from a primarily MPO
task structure for this part of the data analysis. The AVO task list consisted of AVO tasks
associated with flight and navigation functions, excluding tasks involved with take-off and
landing. In addition, nine certified EPs were tested using the external pilot task structure for the
JASS testing. Further, because of the difference in EP experience levels, those with a year or
less of experience were considered the low experience group (4) and those with more than 1 year
of experience (5) were designated the high experience group. The EP task list consisted of
functions related to take-off and landing an air vehicle. This same list of EP functions was
administered to 16 currently rated U.S. Army aviators. The aviators characterized themselves as
primarily fixed wing (10) or rotary wing (6) when they answered JASS.

                 Data from the ECAT selection test battery were used in this analysis as well. The
two sub-tests used were the one- and the two-handed tracking tasks. This test was administered
in 1995 and used a sample of 28 students from both the Pioneer and Hunter external pilot classes
held at Fort Huachuca, including six participants who failed the external pilot course. Finally, a
SME group consisting of 12 members was used to help interpret the data. The group was
comprised of military, contractor, and civilian personnel with operational and human engineering
backgrounds related to the UAV crew issues.

         Test Instruments

                  Job Assessment Software System (JASS)

                           JASS is a test instrument developed to elicit from soldiers the relative
importance of 50 skills and abilities for specific task functions defining various MOSs. The
computerized test is designed to allow the soldiers to rate each skill designation on a seven-point
scale for each specified military task. The itemized skills and abilities are illustrated in Figure 1,
broken into functional areas: communication, speed-loaded, reasoning, visual, auditory, and
psychomotor (fine and gross motor skills). The test is based on validated psychometric
investigations performed by Fleishman and his colleagues (Fleishman & Quaintance, 1984) and
broken into the underlying cognitive, perceptual, and psychomotor skills that would constitute
any human work activity.

                           This version of JASS was tailored for military applications and was
developed using a number of MOS test cases to validate further the basic concepts in an
operational context (Knapp & Tillman, 1998). The JASS software was administered to the soldier
participants on a laptop computer and required approximately an hour of each soldier's time. Test
administrators were present to answer queries about test or procedural matters related to JASS.

Institute and the U.S. Naval Personnel Research and Development Center. It consists of nine
sub-tests that were designed to supplement the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery
(ASVAB) now used by the Department of Defense for initial selection and training purposes.
For this effort, data were collected using only two of the nine sub-tests. These particular tests
measured one- and two-handed tracking performance, respectively. The tests were computer
administered and lasted approximately 20 minutes each.

Results

         The AVO JASS data were investigated to determine whether the requirement for high
levels of cognitive skills was pertinent to the flight issues discussed. Figure 2 summarizes the
results and indicates that the AVO raters did not consider their flight-related functions (except
for communications) to be overly demanding for any of the skill clusters. The complete skill
profiles are presented in Appendix B and basically show the same trend. These data are
supported by both the accident reports reported next and the feedback from SMEs; the AVO
cognitive skill level requirements do not seem to be related to flight issues.

         The EP data were more complicated, and both anecdotal and empirical information
suggest an important relationship between the EP's skill levels and safety (the data summary is
given in Appendix C). Figure 3 is a bar graph plot of the skill categories as a function of skill
rating. When the EP's job is compared with the AVO data, it can be seen that this job is rated as
requiring higher skill and ability levels across all eight skill clusters.

            aviators (both rotary and fixed wing).

         The data are decomposed further into four job categories: EP low experience, EP high
experience, rotary wing aviators, and fixed wing aviators. The main difference was in the
reasoning factor, with both aviator groups showing slightly increased importance attached to
reasoning skills, compared to the EP groups. There is evidence of relatively heavy loadings on
conceptual, vision, and psychomotor components for all groups. The EP low experience group
seems to give high ratings to the vision, audition, and psychomotor skill clusters. This suggests
that the initial training may have been particularly weighted toward developing these skills.

         The ECAT results obtained in a previous study support the particular importance of
psychomotor skills during training. As Table 1 indicates, the one- and two-handed tracking
scores were nearly perfect indicators of failure rate during the EP training at Fort Huachuca. Five
of the six students who failed the course had scores on both the tracking tasks near the bottom of
the performance scores of the sampled students. The EP designated "x" who also failed had a
severely impaired hand, making his failure to complete the course difficult to interpret.

         The data were further analyzed to understand precisely the relationship between flight
safety and skill clusters for the four job categories. First, only the task data related to emergency
conditions were examined (emergency landings, etc.). Next, identification was made of which of
the 50 skills (see Figure 1 for the full listing) were ranked in the top 10 for each of the
emergency condition tasks. Finally, determination was made as to how many of these skills
were in each skill cluster, and these data were plotted as a function of what percentage of each
cluster was represented in the top 10. Based on previous research, it was felt that the importance
rankings were a better indicator of the usefulness of each skill cluster in performing crucial task
functions vice using simple average skill values (Knapp & Tillman, 1998). The results are
plotted in Figure 4, which shows a very different relationship between experience level and the
type of skills required in emergency conditions. The experienced EP used mostly conceptual
skills in emergency situations, whereas the inexperienced EP reported relying heavily on visual
and psychomotor skills during these conditions. These findings are consistent with the results of
the ECAT tracking tasks reported (which indicated how important the student's perceptual and
motor skills were in passing the EP portion of the UAV training regimen). A surprising finding
was that the aviators used speed-loaded skills for emergencies, whereas speed-loaded skills were
rated as relatively unimportant by both EP groups.

         The UAV accident and air safety report (TSM, 1998) indicated that both the Pioneer
and the Hunter UAVs historically had high accident rates of an average of one incident per
every 269 and 158 operational hours, respectively. Not surprisingly, almost all of the incidents
involved EPs because take-off and landing are the most dangerous parts of the mission for
flight safety. However, since 1996, the Hunter EP incident rate has fallen dramatically to
1,201 hours per incident, which compares favorably to the Predator (current Air Force UAV)
rate of 1,247 hours per incident. One possibility for this improvement is the maturing of the
Hunter EP cadre. Data discussed later support this hypothesis.

Discussion

         Scant evidence was found for the need of rated aviator skills for the AVO. The JASS list
of critical skills, accident data, and the consensus of the SME deliberations suggest that the current
skill level of the AVO community is sufficient for piloting responsibilities. The EP situation is
more complex. There was a marked difference between experienced and inexperienced EPs in the
inventory of skills the two groups used during emergency situations. Apparently, the experienced
EPs were able to visualize and anticipate problems before they occurred; an experienced UAV

                                                                     11
Operator described the process as "getting ahead of the air vehicle." With experience, the operator
is able to devote his or her attentional resources to future problems while attending to the immediate
perceptual and motor tasks in an automatic mode. In effect, the operator crosses a cognitive
threshold as expertise increases and the problem domain becomes more cognitive and less
psychomotor intensive. This agrees with the psychological literature regarding both automatic
processing (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977) and the development of expertise (Rasmussen, 1983). If
this interpretation is correct, using rated aviators would have little effect on the accident rate during
landing and take-off. Expertise tends to be task specific. Therefore, the specific motor skills
needed to control the radio-controlled UAV would have to be learned by aviators independently of
the motor skills learned in flying an aircraft. In particular, the somatic and visual cues that pilots
use during aircraft landings would not be useful (and perhaps even counter-productive) for the
different skill sets and perceptual viewpoint necessary for radio-controlled landings. This is not to
say that there would not be some transfer of training, only that the transfer would be transitory, and
the more cost-effective solution would be to develop expertise in the EP corps.

         The improvement in the Hunter accident rate gives at least some preliminary assurance that
the EP performance record will improve with the maturing of the operator population. This does
not address the question of how to turn novices into experts. Fortunately, innovative research
funded by the Israeli Air Force offers some promise in addressing this issue. Gopher, Weil, and
Bareket (1994) developed a computer game to help train Israeli Air Force cadets before flight
training. The computer game simulation was not high fidelity and did not stress motor skills;
instead, the game emphasized the higher level conceptual skills (such as the ones identified in the
JASS for the experienced EPs) necessary to anticipate and plan in a combat aviation environment.
The simulation group was able to generalize these skill sets to actual training. Students practicing
the computer game were twice as likely to graduate from advanced flight training as the no-game
control groups. The Israeli Air Force has since adopted the computer game as part of their training
program. The UAV program would very likely benefit from a similar computer training project.
The software would be cost effective because air vehicle fidelity is not an issue; the simulation
would need to emphasize attentional and visualization skills. These skills could be developed in
parallel to the psychomotor and other flight skills currently being developed in the training
program.

                                                         12
         A number of related issues were discussed with the SMEs during the consensus exercise
held at Fort Huachuca. The greater use of speed-loaded skills by the aviators at first seemed
counter-intuitive to the SME group. However, further discussion suggested that the underlying
cause was related to the demands of the different aircraft flown by the two communities. The
controls and displays that both fixed and rotor wing aviators use are extremely complex,
especially compared to the relatively simple EP interface. Thus, the EPs could concentrate on
future aircraft states, whereas the aviators had to respond to the more complex interface
environment as well as anticipate future problems.

         The question of using rated aviators in either the AVO or EP positions was specifically
addressed by the group after the data were presented. The group consensus was that UAV
operators do not need to be rated aviators for Army applications. In particular, neither the Air
Force nor the Navy representatives believed that the EP or AVO should necessarily be aviator
rated. The Navy's solution was to have the equivalent of the mission commander be aviator
rated when possible. This solution had the advantage of freeing the AVO and EP to concentrate
on UAV-related issues, while the mission commander handled the mission planning and air
space coordination, giving the crew the benefit of his or her aviation expertise in a supervisory
role. The Air Force representative pointed out that the Predator (a current Air Force UAV) was a
different air vehicle than those employed by the Army. The Predator was designed to be flown
like a standard aircraft and as such, the transfer of skills from the aviator to the UAV community
was a natural solution. According to this representative, no firm decision had been made
concerning the use of rated aviators for future Air Force UAVs such as Dark Star.

         In summary, there was no evidence that would lead to the conclusion that either the AVO
or the EP should be rated aviators. In particular, the EPs' landing and take-off functions require
motor and cognitive skills that are unique to their mission profiles and job environment. However,
the greater use of cognitive skills by the experienced EPs suggests that greater emphasis should be
placed on developing these skills during training. The use of computer games was offered as an
innovative and cost-effective solution to accomplish this end. Finally, the utility of having military
aviators or personnel with equivalent experience as part of the decision chain for UAV crews
seems to be both a cost-efficient and a tactically effective method to introduce aviator skill sets
into the UAV program.

                                                                            13
IMAGERY AND INTELLIGENCE SPECIALISTS AS COMPONENTS OF THE UAV CREW

         As mentioned, two 96U operators reside in the GCS during a typical mission. The MPO
works with the AVO to search the target area and make preliminary recognition and detection
decisions regarding potential targets in the locations designated by the intelligence staff as
named areas of interest (NAI). However, MPOs are not imagery or intelligence analysts, and
their reporting requirements in this regard are minimal. In light of the specialized skills of the
UAV crews, the possibility of adding operators from MOSs with skills and abilities that
complement the MPOs' skill set was the focus of this portion of the study. The two MOSs
investigated were the 96B, Intelligence Analyst, and the 96D, Imagery Analyst.

Method
         Procedure
                  The JASS computer-based job assessment system was used as in the rated aviator

section work. Data analysis proved to be fairly complicated because 96B and 96D MOSs have
distinctly different task structures and would therefore bring different skill sets to the 96U crew.
In order to assess the commonalities as well as the differences among the three jobs, separate
task structures had to be derived for each of the MOS positions. From the task lists, it was then
possible to derive an overall ranking of the importance of the JASS skill sets for each task
structure.

                  The actual comparison was done in three steps: (a) the top 20 JASS skills (see
Figure 1) for each of the 16 tasks that the MPO performed were rank ordered; (b) the top 20
skills for both the 96B and 96D distinct skill sets were ranked separately; and (c) the resulting
ranks of the JASS skills from the 96B and the 96D were compared to the ranks of the JASS skills
for the 96U operators for each of the 16 tasks evaluated in the initial step. Kendall's rank order
correlation test was used to evaluate rank concordance.

         Participants

                  The comparison was made for the tasks to which the 21 96Us responded on the
JASS inventory. Scores from nine 96B analysts and eight 96D imagery specialists were

                                                                    14
collected on the JASS in order to compare the skill sets of these two MOSs to those of the UAV
GCS operators. All soldiers were stationed at Fort Huachuca.

Results and Discussion

         Table 2 matches the UAV crew task duties to the skill rankings for the 96B and 96D
operators. Kendall's rank order correlation test was used to assess the commonalities among the
JASS results. The columns in Table 2 labeled "MOS" indicate the degree of correlation between
the 96D and 96B skill rankings and the rankings on each of the duties listed in the first column.
The 96D skill rankings were significantly correlated to two of the UAV crew duties (p < .05). In
contrast, the 96B showed a significant Kendall rank correlation to 14 of the 16 duties the UAV
crew engaged in during their missions (again, p < .05). Interpretation of the data was that the 96D
was a possible candidate to complement the skill profiles of the UAV crews because of the
difference in the skill sets used by these two MOS groups. In terms of information theory, the
lack of redundancy between the two MOSs implies a higher information transmission rate. The
authors' interpretation was given credibility by the SME discussions that indicated the importance
of enhancing the imagery interpretation skills of the MPO in particular. It was felt, especially by
the 96U operator participants, that the 96D skills would be a very useful addition to the UAV
crew. This does not imply that MPO requires the in-depth imagery understanding of the 96D; the
96D skills could be employed remotely at the brigade or division tactical operations center
(TOC). For many or perhaps even most missions, the detection and recognition reporting skills of
the MPO would suffice to meet the commander's goals. The 96D skills would be necessary for
particularly difficult interpretations or specialized missions when in-depth target analyses are
required. Another possibility would be to incorporate the 96D skills into the mission command
module by enhancing the skill set of the data exploitation operator (DEO) with additional imagery
training. The DEO resides in the command module and performs the function of a senior analyst
but is not currently required to have 96D training. In summary, the principal conclusion is that
additional imagery support using 96D specialists should enhance the overall operational
versatility and capabilities of the UAV crews. On the other hand, the role of the 96B as now
configured seems to be a satisfactory adjunct to the UAV crews' intelligence-gathering function.

AUTOMATION AND WORKLOAD MODELING FOR FUTURE UAV PLATFORMS

         An important consideration in designing the future crew interfaces is the degree and type of
automation required in future UAV applications. The UAV operator has to perform multiple
functions, often simultaneously during a typical mission profile (Barnes & Matz, 1998). In order
to understand automation requirements in this environment, the MicroSaintTM modeling environment
was used to investigate the workload for one potential future UAV platform, the Outrider. The
Outrider was a good candidate to investigate incipient crew workload issues (i.e., high workload
may suggest a need to automate tasks) because the Outrider was in the process of completing an

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                TM

advanced combat technology development (ACTD) during these data collection efforts. MicroSaint
was chosen because it is a relatively mature instrument and has been used successfully in a number
of human engineering applications. (A detailed description of MicroSaintTM is given in Appendix D.)
However, the general findings of this report should generalize to a larger class of PC workload

(IMPRINT).

Method

         Procedure

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          TM

                  First, a model of the Hunter UAV system was developed by using MicroSaint
and a database that contained most of the GCS operator tasks and functions related to the Hunter
system, which range from setting up the equipment, route planing, internal flight procedures, and
intelligence gathering to actually landing the UAV. The Hunter model was based mainly on a
Hardman III workload task analysis1 done for the Joint Tactical UAV Program Office as part of a
previous project. In addition to task time data and the task sequence logic, the database
contained the visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor workload values for each task. This
model served as a foundation for the design of the Outrider model.

                  The Hunter model was then modified according to information from SMEs and
data collected during an observation of the Outrider training simulator. The scenario chosen to be
used in the model included four stationary targets, no malfunctions, and no in-flight modifications.
After the model was executed, two sets of data were produced: the workload values for each
operator throughout the scenario and the number of steps required to perform each task.

         Participants

                  The number of SMEs available to assist in building the Outrider model was small;
however, the scarcity of the subject pool was mitigated by drawing upon an existing network
model of the Hunter UAV, which had been validated during a number of simulation exercises
(Barnes & Matz, 1998). The first iteration of knowledge elicitation was done at Fort Huachuca
with two experienced UAV operators who were familiar with the Outrider and a human factors
specialist familiar with the previous workload model developed for the Hunter in the 1993-1995
time frame. The next iteration was completed at Fort Hood using two 96U soldiers who had

'Test battery developed by ARI

                                17
been trained the month before in the Outrider training simulator in Hondo, Texas. The last
iteration took place in Hondo with two SMEs whose job was to develop lesson plans for the
training simulator and to teach 96U operators to use the Outrider simulator. Both operators had
been flight-qualified Hunter operators before being employed in their current positions.

         Workload Scales
                  The visual, auditory, cognitive, and perceptual (VACP) workload theory

implemented in this work is discussed in detail in an Army Research Institute report (McCracken
& Aldrich, 1984).

                  Workload theory is based upon the idea that every task a human performs requires
some effort or work. Usually, a task is composed of several different types of work, such as
visual or cognitive. For example, consider a task such as steering a car. This task will have
some visual work (watch where you are going), some cognitive work (decide if you are turning
enough), and some psychomotor work (rotate the steering wheel). The workload theory
implemented in this effort assigns values representing the amount of effort that must be
expended in each channel in order to perform the task. Table 3 scales are taken directly from
Bierbaum, Szabo, and Aldrich (1989).

                  This theory also hypothesizes that when two tasks are performed at once, the
workload levels are additive within channels, across tasks. For example, if two tasks are being
done at once, one with a psychomotor load of 2.6 and one with a psychomotor load of 4.6, then a
psychomotor score of 7.2 (2.6 + 4.6) would be recorded for the time that the two tasks were
being performed together.

Results
         Four different categories of data were collected to help determine which tasks should be

candidates for automation. These categories were based on the model output and data taken
from interviews with the SMEs. Besides the two model-based data sources, the SMEs provided
a list of tasks that were critical to the mission, and they indicated which additional tasks they
would like to see automated.

                                                                     18

         Automation is generally suggested for tasks (a) that have high workload, (b) that require
multiple operator actions, (c) that are mission critical or life threatening, and (d) the operator
feels are auxiliary or bookkeeping, which could be automated easily. The four categories of data
(workload, steps per task, critical tasks, and operator suggestions) were analyzed to identify

                                                                    19
which tasks might be automated. Tasks that appear in multiple categories were then reviewed
for a final recommendation about the requirement for automation.

         Workload

                  Each task within the Outrider model has corresponding visual, auditory, cognitive,
and psychomotor workload values. Tasks that have workload values of 5.2 or higher in at least
two of the workload components were viewed as high workload tasks and are listed next:

                  · Enter way points
                  · Verify system settings
                  · Monitor video, telemetry, and systems
                  · Check AV and navigation systems
                  · Enter way points and prepare flight plan

         Steps Per Task
                  Each task within the Outrider model is performed in one or more steps. The tasks

with three or more steps involved are

         Critical Tasks
                  The functions that must be performed in order for the mission to be completed are

                  · Recover AV

                  Tasks that operators suggested are
                  · Analyze and modify mission plan
                  · Perform pre-flight functions

         The tasks that appear in two or three of the categories are listed next. No tasks appeared
in all four categories. Tasks from the function "set up equipment" were removed because they
cannot be automated. Tasks from the function "perform off-line mission planning" were also
removed because it is a non-critical function that is usually performed only during training and
because the UAV operators already perform mission planning "on line".

         · Perform pre-flight procedures
         · Verify system settings

                                                              21

Discussion

         The results indicate that the candidates for automation include pre- and post-flight
procedures and checks, verification of system settings, and computer checks for the mission
plans. This corresponds with the suggestions provided by the SMEs who stated that although the
Outrider system does provide some error messages, it does not check to see if the mission plan or
system settings are within range or engineering limits. In addition, the results indicate that
monitoring is another task that could be automated. However, monitoring the aircraft is one
reason why human operators are involved in the "loop". Still, this task can be partially
automated (e.g., warnings or voice commands can be given by the system when certain
parameters are no longer within specified values). In particular, when system safety is involved,
having both the human and the system computer monitor for possible safety issues is essential.
The task "modify landing" addresses the issue of unsafe landings and would entail extensive
analyses to determine the optimal mixture of human and computer control during dangerous
landing situations. In general, the operators were not asking for fully automated systems;
instead, they preferred the decision making to remain with the operator and the workload
reduction to be accomplished by making the computer interface faster and more efficient as well
as having the computer become another set of "eyes" to check for safety problems.

         It is also important to determine how operators react when the system behaves
unexpectedly and which corrective tasks should be automated or computer aided. Areas for
future work include expanding the model to simulate more scenarios, such as instances of
dynamic targets and system malfunctions, and to collect human performance to extend the
model's capabilities to predict mission and task outcomes. Further investigation is also needed
to examine the human cognitive profile related to search tasks and to assess the utility of

                                                                            22
automated search and target detection algorithms. Finally, the model should be improved so that
it is possible to examine how fatigue and possibly stress factors affect operator performance and
overall mission safety in future UAV operational tempos.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

         The use of a variety of human engineering tools has helped in our understanding of future
crew environments. Most of the results were generic and can be used to help guide the design
process for any UAV configurations involved in tactical Army missions. For example, the
MicroS aintTM model generated a number of hypothetical task structures for possible automation,
which should generalize to most future tactical UAV environments. These tasks can be narrowed
further by design considerations, and realistic soldier-in-the-loop simulation experiments can then
be designed to focus on a small set of pre-selected tasks. The results of the JASS study for the
rated pilots were supplemented by performance data from both training and accident data that
indicated the ability of these techniques to combine easily with empirical methods. Another
feature of the analyses was the reliance on the SME team for interpretation. This is probably
inevitable in a developing system because no one person could possibly understand the tactical,
programmatic, and engineering issues of a system that is yet to be developed. The backgrounds of
the SMEs involved were broad enough to cover many of these facets, thus laying a firm foundation
for further analyses. Also, the combination of modeling techniques and expert input helped to
curtail the shortcomings of both approaches by constraining the experts' tendency to tell "war
stories" and by giving the results of the modeling efforts face validity and an operational context.

         The preliminary suggestions for the UAV program, which were derived across the three
sets of analyses, are

         1. It is not cost efficient to require flight certification for either the AVO or EP operator
positions.

         2. Computerized training (especially embedded training) should be an effective means
for developing operator flight skills. These efforts should concentrate on the cognitive
components of the flight tasks.

                                                                    23
         3. Aviator-rated personnel (or personnel with equivalent expertise) should be involved in
the decision chain to aid the UAV crew in mission planning, air space coordination, and general
liaison with the other services.

         4. Imagery interpretation skills drawn from the 96D training program would be a useful
addition to the UAV targeting and reporting process. These skills do not have to be present in
UAV ground control stations.

         5. Automation requirements for the UAV operator should focus on computer assistance
(e.g., quickly change way points) and system monitoring rather than on acquiring fully
automated sub-systems. (Note. The utility of automated landing and take-off was not addressed
in this study because the status of this feature on the Outrider was not clear at the time the
workload data were collected.)

         6. Future modeling efforts should include human performance (particularly in the search
domain) and fatigue and stress data to predict mission performance during future UAV
operational tempos more effectively.

         The basic premise of this effort is that by using a variety of human engineering methods,
a set of tools and methods could be created, which will mutually reinforce each other. The
authors deliberately chose to investigate methods that were both cost and time efficient, thus

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      TM

avoiding methods that required large-scale simulations or field exercises. MicroSaint was
chosen in part because it is available on personal computers and its software is relatively
inexpensive and easy to use. The overall goal is to improve the human engineering design
process by introducing methods (particularly computerized ones) that encourage early human
system integration (HSI) analysis before the traditional materiel acquisition process begins. Too
often, especially early in the acquisition process, the amount of HSI analysis is determined by

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        TM

cost and timeliness considerations. Tools such as JASS, ECAT, IMPRINT, and MicroSaint are
being continually refined and validated to be more efficient and scientifically valid. The strategy
adapted here is to combine these methods for a synergistic approach that can be used to
investigate a complex and changing HSI environment early in the design process.

                     DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION USING MICROSAINTTM

         Discrete event simulations (DES) use a computer model to describe a process that can be
expressed as a sequence of events, each with a distinct beginning and end. Events can be any
part of the process, such as scheduled activities or tasks that represent the flow of the process.
The tasks are displayed schematically on a diagram called the task network diagram, which is the
basis of the model.

                                                      TM

         MicroSaint is a simulation software package for constructing models that simulate real-
life processes. In this section, the basic DES components that comprise the MicroSaintTM
software tool are described. Models can be relatively simple or complex. A simple, functional
model can be built just by creating a network diagram and entering task timing information for
each task in the network. More complex models can be built, which include dynamically
changing variables, probabilistic and tactical branching logic, conditional task execution, and
extensive model data collection--all of which can be specified by choosing menu commands or
providing expressions for MicroSaintTM to execute during specific circumstances.

         Whether the model is simple or complex, the process of executing a MicroSaintTM model
and generating statistics and graphs from the collected data is mostly automatic. The software
uses random numbers to generate specific task times from a pre-established distribution and
routing choices specific to the current execution. After the model has been run, statistic charts,
scatter plots, line or step graphs, bar charts, and frequency distributions can be used to analyze
the data collected during model execution. In addition, the results files can be opened in
spreadsheets or statistical packages for further analysis.

        This section is designed to provide sufficient information about MicroSaintTM so that the
Outrider UAV modeling presented in this report can be understood. This is not meant to provide a
complete understanding of how MicroSaintTM can be used for modeling in general. For questions
and a more detailed understanding of MicroSaintTM, refer to the MicroSaintTM 3.0 manual.

                                                                    49
User Interface
        MicroSaintTM uses a standard WindowsTM-style graphical interface. The standard point-

and-click method is used to select MicroSaintTM tools and to define and move objects. Double-
clicking an object with the mouse opens a description dialog box where information specific to
the object can be entered. Figure D-l shows the task network diagram window of MicroSaint .
The window contains a sample network diagram of four nodes labeled 1 through 4, with a
probabilistic decision node after Node 2.

Task Network Diagram
         The task network is a graphical representation of the process that is being modeled.

Tasks are represented in a diagram that shows the order of task execution within the process. A
task network diagram is composed of nodes representing tasks that are connected by arrows. A
rounded rectangle or oval shape represents each task. Sub-networks are represented by a
rectangle. The arrows between the nodes indicate the possible sequences in which the tasks can

                                                                    50
be performed. Figure D-l is an example of a task network. The "P" in the diamond-shaped node
represents the type of decision (probabilistic) that is used to determine which path is taken.

         Task and network nodes are created in MicroSaintTM with the task and network tools.
Users click on the network diagram with one of the tools to place a task or network and then
continue clicking to place subsequent tasks (or networks). The path tool is used to draw a path
from each task or network to any other task or network that can follow it, and it indicates the
direction of task execution. MicroSaintTM also uses symbolic animation during execution. When a
particular task in the network has been reached, the rounded rectangle for that task is highlighted.
The animation shows entities (items, people, etc.) as they move through the network. This type of
animation is particularly useful in debugging a model and when verifying a model with SMEs.

Task Description

         Tasks are the lowest level in a model network hierarchy and are described by specific
parameters such as task timing information, release condition, and beginning and ending effect,
which relate the task to other system activities. An example of the task description dialog box is 
displayed in Figure D-2. The description is for Task Number 1 (this number is inside the
MicroSaint software and does not affect or reference the process being modeled); a name for
the task can be entered into the name field. Expressions for each of the task parameters can be
entered in the labeled fields.

         Task Timing Information

                  Task timing information consists of the mean time for the task, the standard
deviation, and a type of time distribution. In Figure D-2, the task mean time is 10 time units
(hours, minutes, seconds, etc.), the standard deviation is one time unit, and the time distribution
is normal.

                  The mean time is the average time required to complete a task. For example, if
the task represents an activity such as "enter way points," then the mean time to execute the task
is the average time that it takes an operator to enter the way points. The mean time is used in
conjunction with the standard deviation and time distribution to determine the simulated task

                                                                            51
execution time for each execution of the task. The standard deviation is used in conjunction with
the time distribution and controls the spread of a distribution

                  The time distribution indicates the function used by MicroSaintTM to randomly
generate execution times for a task. The mean time and standard deviation are used in
conjunction with the probability distribution to determine the task execution time. In most cases,
the execution time is not constant, but instead, the execution time is variable within a range of
values that can be represented by a probability distribution. MicroSaintTM supports more than 21
probability distribution types, including normal, rectangular, exponential, gamma, Wiebull,
Poisson, triangular, and others.

         Release Conditions
                  Situations often occur when a task cannot begin executing until certain conditions

are met. A task can have resource requirements such as availability of an operator or other

                                                                            52
constraints such as time of day or availability of part type that controls when the task can begin.
In MicroSaintTM, the expression in the "release condition" field can prevent a task from executing
until certain conditions in the model are met (e.g., the availability of a resource, the completion
of another task). The release condition expression can be as simple as the value 1 for tasks that
execute as soon as the previous task completes, or it may be a complicated expression in which
several conditions are evaluated. Entities moving through the network cannot be released into a
task for processing until the release conditions for the task are met.

         Task Execution Effects
                  An execution effect defines how the task performance affects other aspects of the

system. For instance, the current state of the system may change when a task begins and then
change again when the task ends. These changes are made using expressions in the beginning
and ending effects of a task description. In the example in Figure D-2, the expression in the
beginning effect of the task reduces the number of available operators by one. The expression in
ending effect increases the number of available operators by one.

Controlling Process Logic
         The arrows that are displayed between nodes define the basic order in which tasks are

executed. Alternatives are indicated when more than one path is displayed, which originated
from a single node. Task sequences can also be affected by conditions outside the network
diagram. For example, a task can be started as a function of time. A diamond-shaped "decision
node" automatically displays on the network diagram when more than one path follows a task.
These decision points can be used to represent real-world decisions or to control aspects of how
the model works, which may have little to do with the process being modeled.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            TM

         The conditions that control the branching must be entered as expressions. MicroSaint
provides the following decision types to ensure that real-world situations can be represented in
the model:

         1. In a probabilistic decision type, the next task to execute is determined by the relative
probabilities of all tasks listed. Probabilistic decisions allow only one of the following tasks to
execute.

                                                                    53
         2. In a multiple decision type, all the tasks with conditions that evaluate to non-zero will
execute. This allows for one or more tasks to begin execution, based on rules that determine
execution tasks.

         3. In a tactical decision type, the next task to execute is the task with the condition that
evaluates to the highest value. This allows for rule-based decisions. A tactical decision type
differs from the multiple type in that only one following task is executed.

         Variables and algebraic expressions can be used in the branching logic, and the value of
the variables can be changed by conditions in the model. This allows complete control and
manipulation of the network flow.

Simulation Clock
         The simulation clock tracks the simulated time as the model executes. Time can be

advanced in the simulation either infixed or variable time intervals. In afixed interval
simulation, the simulation clock is advanced in fixed time intervals; the simulation is referred to
as clock driven. Examples of clock-driven simulations are chemical processes and weather
models. In a variable interval simulation, events are used to advance the clock in initial value
and type (integer, real, array of integers, array of real numbers).

Expressions
         An expression can be a calculation, formula, function, or statement that supplies a value

or performs an operation. Expressions are used to supply numerical values such as mean times
or true or false values such as those used in release conditions. They are used to make changes
in the state of the model, such as beginning effects and ending effects. Each expression in
MicroSaintTM must end with a semi-colon and can include any of the following elements:

         · Constants
         · Variables
         · Functions (groups of expressions that can be referred to or called)
         · Comments

                                                                            54
         · Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /,A, %, ())
         · Assignment operator (:=)
         · Adjustment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)
         · Logical operators (>, >=, <, <=, &, ==, I, <>)
         · If-then-else and while-do statements

Scenario Event

         A scenario event is scheduled to occur at a specific time (in simulation time) during
model execution. Scenario events are also used to change variable values, thereby changing the
state of the model. These can be one-time events or they can repeat at regular intervals. An
example of a one-time event would be setting a variable at simulation time zero, indicating the
number of alarms that will sound during a nuclear plant disturbance. Scenario events are defined
by supplying the following information for each event in the event description dialog box:

         1. Time of occurrence.
         2. Whether the event should repeat and at what interval.
         3. Time when you want the event to stop repeating, if applicable.
         4. The expressions you want executed at the specified time(s).

Model Execution

         When the model execution is started, an entity begins at the first task node in the model.
If the release condition for that task is evaluated to "true," then the task executes. The effect(s)
that the task has on the system are evaluated, based on the expressions defining the task
description. The changes are expressed in variables that can be used in other tasks in the model.
Once the task is completed, the entity proceeds to the next task in the network diagram. When
more than one path is available, the branching logic is used to determine the path the entity will
follow. In general, the entire network diagram is traversed by the entity and the model is
completed when the entity reaches the end of the last task in the network. Models can have
conditions that send entities through the network until a specified simulation time or until a pre-
determined number has completed the simulation.

                                                                    55
Data Collection During Model Execution
         The output data for a simulation are specific values of model variables recorded at

specific times during the execution of the model. The data recorded are used to answer the
questions about the system being modeled. The output is similar to the results of an experiment.
Data output can include measures of system effectiveness or can be used for system diagnostics.
Some examples of useful output are resource use, cost, and errors initiated.

         Data are collected during the execution of a MicroSaintTM model using a feature called
"snapshots". Snapshots provide a way to collect values of variables at specified points during
model execution. They can be programmed to occur at specific clock times, when a task begins
or ends, or when a model execution ends. Snapshots are defined by providing the following
information in the snapshot description dialog box:

         1. A name for the document where the data are stored.
         2. The "trigger types" for the snapshot (end of run, clock, begin task, end task).
         3. The number of the triggering task, if applicable.
         4. The start time, stop time, and repeat interval, as applicable, if the snapshot has a clock
trigger.
         5. The names of the variables for which you want to record values.

         Once the snapshots have been defined, they can be set to "on" or "off during model
execution. When they are turned "on," the variable values are stored in a results file with the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     TM

extension ".res". After the file is opened, the analyze commands in MicroSaint can be used to
generate statistics and create graphs from the data. The data can also be imported into other
statistical analysis packages.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)

    The purpose of the research project was to understand the future crew environments for developing unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) systems. A variety of human engineering tools (job assessment software system [JASS], enhanced computer-aided
    testing [ECAT], and MicroSaintTM) were used to address crew issues related to the utility of having rated aviators as crew
    members, supplementing current crews with imagery and intelligence specialists, and the use of automation to improve systems
    efficiency. Data from 70 soldiers and experts from Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Fort Hood, Texas, and Hondo, Texas, were
    collected as part of this effort. The general finding was that the use of cognitive methods and computerized tool sets to
    understand future crew environments proved to be cost effective and useful. Specifically, no evidence was found to support a
    requirement for rated aviators in future Army missions, but the use of cognitively oriented embedded training simulators was
    suggested to aid novices in developing the cognitive skills evinced by experts. The efficacy of adding imagery specialists to
    96U crews was discussed, and specific recommendations related to automation were derived from the workload modeling.

This research study was undertaken to create recommendations for unmanned aircraft pilot medical
certification requirements. The effort consisted of the convening of a panel of subject matter experts and
interactions with groups engaged in the process of establishing unmanned aircraft pilot guidelines. The results
of this effort were a recommendation and justification for use of the second-class medical certification.

   This research addressed the medical requirements necessary for unmanned aircraft (UA) pilots for successful
flight in the National Airspace System (NAS). Given that an existing medical certification was recommended, the
question of which class of certification to propose was based on the perceived level of risk imposed by the potential
incapacitation of the UA pilot. A second-class medical certification was judged to be the most acceptable, consider-
ing that there were several factors that mitigated the risk of pilot incapacitation relative to those of manned aircraft.
First, factors related to changes in air pressure could be ignored, assuming that control stations for non-military
operations would be on the ground. Second, many of the current UA systems have procedures that have been
established for lost data link. Lost data link, where the pilot cannot transmit commands to the aircraft, is function-
ally equivalent to pilot incapacitation. Third, the level of automation of a system determines the criticality of pilot
incapacitation because some highly automated systems (e.g., Global Hawk) will continue normal flight whether a
pilot is or is not present.

                                          INTRODUCTION

         Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are quickly becoming a part of the national
airspace system (NAS) as they transition from primarily military and hobbyist
applications to mainstream flight applications such as security monitoring, satellite
transport, and cargo hauling. Before the full potential of UAV flight in the NAS can be
realized, however, FAA standards and regulations for UAV operations must be
established. Given the experience of the U.S. military that mishap rates for UAVs are
several times higher than for manned aircraft (Williams, 2004)--over thirty times higher,
in some cases (Department of Defense, 2001)--the importance of carefully designed
standards and regulations is clear.

         Issues related to human factors are likely to be of particular concern in
establishing guidelines for UAV flight. As noted by Gawron (1998), UAV flight presents
human factors challenges different from and in some ways greater than those of manned
flight. These arise primarily from the fact that operator and aircraft are not co-located. As
discussed in more detail below, the separation of operator and vehicle imposes a number
of barriers to optimum human performance, including loss of sensory cues valuable for
flight control, delays in control and communications loops, and difficulty in scanning the
visual environment surrounding the vehicle. Unmanned flight also allows the possibility
that a single operator might control multiple vehicles simultaneously, a task likely to
impose unique and heavy workload demands.

         The goal of the current work was to examine the existing research literature on the
human factors of unmanned flight, and to delineate issues for future research to address.
The topics discussed below are divided into the categories Automation; Perceptual and
Cognitive Aspects of Pilot Interface; Air Traffic Management Procedures; and Crew
Qualifications. As will be clear, however, the issues covered within the various
categories are highly interrelated. Answers to questions about crew complement, for
example, will be contingent on the nature and reliability of automation provided to
support UAV operators. Likewise, decisions about interface design will depend on the
extent to which flight control is automated, with manual flight mode demanding
traditional stick-and-rudder controls and automated flight mode allowing for point-and-
click menu-based control or other forms of non-traditional interface.

         It is also important to note that unmanned aircraft will likely serve a range of
purposes in civilian airspace, and that the demands placed on human operators will vary
with characteristics of the flight mission. Proposed uses for UAVs include agricultural,
geological, and meteorological data collection; border surveillance; long distance
transport; search and rescue; disaster monitoring; traffic monitoring; and
telecommunications relay. Furthermore, military UAVs will increasingly be required to
transition through civilian airspace en route to their missions. In some of these cases, the
vehicle is likely to operate solely within line-of-sight communications range and only
over relatively short periods of time (i.e., on the time scale of several hours or less). In
other cases, the vehicle will operate at distances demanding over-the-horizon
communications, and will potentially remain airborne for many days on end. These
mission characteristics will modulate concerns about communications delays between
ground control station and vehicle, and about the need for transfer of vehicle control
between crews. For some applications, additionally, operators will likely be required to
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 3

make frequent control inputs, adjusting flight parameters or selecting new waypoints
"online" in response to changing task demands or conditions. For other applications,
flight path will be predetermined and less susceptible to modification, reducing the
immediacy and frequency with which operators are required to intervene in flight control
and allowing for a heavier reliance on automated vehicle guidance.

TECHNICAL APPROACH
   Our technical approach involved three parallel efforts. (1) We acquired a large body of

literature, both in published sources and in technical reports, that addressed any aspects
of human factors in UAVs. This literature is documented in an annotated bibliography in
Appendix A. (2) We identified laboratories where UAV human factors work is in
progress. These laboratories, and points of contacts, are listed in Appendix C. (3) We
became acquainted with UAV human factors issues in civilian airspace by familiarizing
ourselves with Access 5 documents. (4) We applied our own subject-matter expertise of
both aviation human factors in general, and UAV operations in particular, to identify 18
key human factors research topics, that we believed were relatively unique to UAV
operations. This uniqueness constraint is critical. There are for example numerous human
factors issues that should be applied equally to manned as well as to unmanned aircraft,
relating to topics such as display legibility, CRM and communications, checklist design,
etc. We did not include these in our effort, but note their enduring importance for UAV
certification. Research topics are described in the text below, and in Appendix B are
cross-indexed with relevant sources from the research literature described in Appendix A.

   Having identified issues, and examined written documents that described human
factors research, our final product was to map research needs against existing research
documents, where such documents contained empirically valid findings. This material,
contained in table 1 of the report below, provides an identification of the key research
areas that we believe should be funded, in order to proceed on the path toward safe
certification of UAVs in civilian airspace. We have not explicitly prioritized these areas
in terms of their importance.

AUTOMATION ISSUES
1. To what extent should en route flight control be automated?

         Current UAV systems vary in the degree to which en route flight control is
automated. In some cases the aircraft is guided manually using stick and rudder controls,
with the operator receiving visual imagery from a forward looking camera mounted on
the vehicle. In other cases control is partially automated, such that the operator selects the
desired parameters or behaviors through a computer menu or rotary dial interface in the
ground control station. In other cases still control is fully automated, such that an
autopilot maintains flight control using preprogrammed fly-to coordinates. At least one
system (Pioneer), finally, allows the operator to switch between full manual, hybrid, and
full automation control modes.

         These various modes of flight control each present benefits and drawbacks
(Mouloua, et al, 2003). Full manual control would seem to impose the highest and most
continuous level of cognitive workload on UAV operators. Moreover, manual control
will be degraded by communication delays between UAV and GCS (see #8, #13).
Conversely, fully automated control can prevent an operator from rapidly intervening
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 4

when necessary, (e.g., upon loss of communications) and by leaving the operator largely
"out of the loop" (Wickens & Holland, 2000), can produce degraded situation awareness
(e.g., noticing a change of handling qualities due to icing). Flight planning can also be
excessively time consuming for fully automated systems, sometimes requiring many
weeks (Williams, 2004).

         For reasons like those described above, Mouloua, et al (2003) recommended
hybrid manual/automated control systems for military UAVs. A blanket
recommendation, however, may not be appropriate for UAV flight in civilian airspace.
Rather, the optimal flight control system seems likely to vary with the characteristics of
the flight operation, either within or across flights. UAV operations that entail primarily
long-endurance station-keeping (ACCESS 5, 2003), for example, are not likely to impose
especially high demands on operator situation awareness. Fully automated control might
therefore be more appropriate for such operations that either hybrid or manual
automation. The optimal level of automation may also depend on the number of UAVs
that a single operator is required to control, the communication delays between operator
and UAV, and the quality of visual imagery and other sensory information provided to
the operator from the UAV.

         A number of questions related to the method of UAV flight control thus remain to
be addressed. Research is recommended to:

    · Determine the circumstances under which various modes of UAV flight control--
         fully automated, partially automated, manual--are appropriate.

    · Determine whether or not the level of automated flight control should be
         reconfigurable, such that the operator can alternate between levels of control
         when he/she deems appropriate.

    · Determine whether the reconfiguration of flight control should itself be adaptively
         automated, such that the UAV system adjusts the level of automated flight control
         to match the current circumstances (e.g., the current communications delay
         between UAV and GCS).

    · Determine how and when the UAV operator will be allowed to override the
         automated flight control system.

The output of this work would be a set of rules advising what level of automation should
be available/required, during what phases of flight and types of operations.

2. What are the consequences of degraded reliability of automated UAV functions
for performance of the automated task and of concurrent tasks?

         As the discussion in #1 above makes clear, UAV operations are likely to be
highly automated. It is widely acknowledged, however, that often the effect of
automation is not to reduce the human operator's task demands but rather to change
them, imposing new forms of cognitive workload and modifying the operator's
performance strategies (Parasuraman, 2000). Such changes, and occasional increases in
cognitive workload, often result in circumstances when automation is imperfect. This
imperfection does not refer to issues such as software reliability (e.g., "10 ­5
requirements"), but rather, to circumstances where correctly functioning automation is
incapable of perfectly carrying out the functions asked of it. Examples include on-board
conditions (e.g., icing) for which stability control cannot fully compensate, diagnostic
systems based on imperfect cues, or conflict detection/avoidance algorithms based upon
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 5

future trajectory estimates in a probabilistic environment (Xu, et al, 2002; Kuchar, 2001).
Past work has indicated that imperfect automation at a reliability level greater than
around 0.80 can continue to support performance on the automated task as well as
concurrent tasks (Dixon and Wickens, 2004; Wickens & Dixon, 2005), although this
"threshold" estimate remains far from an absolute value, and other factors, such as the
nature and priority of the automated task, appear to modulate pilot tolerance for
imperfection. To allow the optimal design of automated support systems for UAV
operators, research is thus recommended to:

    · Determine the minimum acceptable reliability levels for automated functions that
         relatively unique to UAV operations.

    · Anticipate potential forms of system failure, and delineate their likely
         consequences.

    · Estimate the means and standard deviations of operators' response times to
         various failures.

Techniques such as Failure Modes Effects Criticality Analysis can be used in these
endeavors.

3. How will see and avoid requirements be addressed in UAV flight? Can automated
detect, see, and avoid (DSA) technology allow a UAV operator to maintain
acceptable levels of separation? What are the consequences of imperfectly reliable
DSA automation on conflict detection and on performance of concurrent tasks?

         The ability to maintain adequate separation between aircraft is a prerequisite for
the safe integration of unmanned vehicles into the NAS. While safe separation from other
aircraft can generally be assured through standard ATC operations in operations under
IFR and IMC (but see issue #13 below), there will be times in which UAVs may be
flying under VFR (or a corresponding designation) in which detect, see and avoid (DSA)
capabilities are essential. In such circumstances, separation may often be maintained
through emerging CNS (communications, navigation, surveillance) technology supported
by GPS navigation and ADS-B communications. However, these conditions do not
accommodate unequipped (non-cooperating) air vehicles that are unable to accurately
transmit (or transmit at all) their position and trajectory through the 3D airspace, and
which may be uncooperative or non-responsive in negotiating conflict avoidance
maneuvers. It is for this reason that automated DSA functions are required. The need for
such functions raise two critical human factors concerns.

         First, operators will be asked to interact with error prone systems. It is likely that
automatic target recognition capabilities will be fallible, particularly if they are asked to
generate early alerts (i.e., at sufficient distance that avoidance maneuvers are possible).
As a consequence, this form of automation will be imperfect (see # 2 above; Thomas,
Wickens, & Rantanen, 2003), leading to either misses (late alerts) or false alerts. Given
the high costs of misses, and low base-rate of events (Parasuraman, Hancock, and
Obofinbaba, 1996), the false alarm rate will be potentially quite high (Krois, 1999). The
effects of such automation errors will have to be considered in designing DSA systems.
Second, operators will be required to interact with the imperfectly reliable DSA system
while also maintaining responsibility for airframe and payload control. These concurrent
responsibilities will determine the degree to which the operator can be expected to
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 6

oversee the DSA, monitoring the raw data of the UAV sensor images of the 3D airspace
upon which the DSA algorithms are based. In light of these concerns, research is
recommended to:

     · Determine how operators will respond to alert imperfections in DSA.
     · Delineate the conflict geometries and visibility conditions that are likely to

         degrade the reliability of DSA automation.
     · Establish procedures by which the output of human perception and automated

         target analysis can be combined to maximize the sensitivity of the two
         component (pilot and algorithm) system given the pilot's concurrent
         responsibility for flight control.

4. To what extent should takeoff and landing be automated?
         Current UAV systems differ in their manner of takeoff and landing. Some (e.g.,

the Hunter and Pioneer) are controlled by an on-site external pilot. Others (e.g., the
Predator) are controlled by an air vehicle operator within the GCS. For others still (e.g.,
the Global Hawk) takeoff and landing are fully automated. These differences appear to be
consequential; takeoff and landing errors constitute a higher proportion of human factors-
related accidents for the Hunter (67%) and Pioneer (78%) systems, both of which are
controlled by an external pilot, than for other systems (Williams, 2004). Research is
therefore recommended to:

    · Determine what method of UAV control during takeoff and landing is appropriate
         for aircraft in civilian airspace.

    · Delineate the responsibilities that the human operator can and will be expected to
         assume in the case of automation failure.

    · Establish guidelines to for how and how will the human operator will be allowed
         to override automated control systems.

PILOT INTERFACE: PERCEPTUAL AND COGNITIVE ISSUES
5. Through what form of control interface should internal and external pilots
manipulate a UAV?

         As noted above, UAV systems will vary in the degree to which airframe control is
automated either en route or during takeoff and landing. For any system that is not fully
automated--including systems that allow for a human operator to intervene in vehicle
control by overriding automation--it will be necessary to provide operators with a
control interface through which to manipulate the vehicle. The form of this interface will
differ for internal pilots, those who interact with the vehicle through an interface of
sensor displays and controls inside a ground control station, and external pilots, those
who interact with the vehicle while in visual contact with it at the site of takeoff or
landing. In the case of full manual control by an internal pilot, the seemingly obvious
choice of control design is a stick and rudder interface like that used for control of
manned aircraft. In cases of partially automated flight control, or of fully automated flight
control where the pilot is provided authority to override the automation when deemed
necessary, the optimal design of control interface is less clear. Current UAV systems vary
in control design, with some systems allowing interaction through knobs or position
switches and others through mouse-driven point-and-click computer menus (Williams,
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 7

2004). Alternative designs may be possible, however, and should be explored.
Additionally, it is important to ensure that any interface be tailored according to
established human factors guidelines; data suggest that some existing UAV system
interfaces are poorly designed for human interaction.

     Similarly, research is necessary to assess and improve the design of controls for
external pilots. Currently, an external pilot manipulates the UAV using joystick controls
similar to those used by radio-controlled aircraft hobbyists (Williams, 2004). These
designs are problematic, however, in that the mapping of vehicle movement to control
input varies depending on the heading of the vehicle relative to that of the EP. When the
heading of the vehicle and pilot are the same, a rightward input to the joystick control
produces rightward motion from the aircraft relative to the pilot. When the heading of the
aircraft and pilot deviate, however, this is no longer true. In the most extreme case, where
the heading of the UAV and pilot differ by 180°, a rightward input on the joystick
produces leftward motion of the vehicle relative to the pilot. Joystick controls for external
pilots are thus not designed to conform consistently to the well-established human factors
principle of motion compatibility (Wickens & Holland, 2000; Wickens, Vincow, & Yeh,
2005). Not surprisingly, this violation appears to be contributing factor in a high number
of UAV mishaps (Williams, 2004). Quigley and colleagues (Quigley, Goodrich, & Beard,
2004) have designed and tested a variety of control interfaces to address this problem.
Further is now necessary to:

     · Explore and optimize the design of control interfaces for internal and external
         pilots' control of UAVs.

     · Delineate the performance benefits and drawbacks of various forms of UAV
         control interface so as to determine which design should be adopted.

6. What compromises should be adopted between spatial resolution, temporal
resolution, time delay, and field-of-view (FOV) in the display of visual imagery for
flight control and/or conflict detection?

         A UAV operator generally relies on imagery from onboard sensors for manual
control of vehicle and payload and for visual target detection. The quality of this visual
information, however, may be degraded due to datalink bandwidth limits and
transmission delays. Specific degradations include poor spatial resolution, limited FOV,
low update rates, and delayed image updating (Van Erp, 2000). These conditions will
impair both vehicle control and the visual detection of air traffic. For example, low image
update rates will degrade perception of motion information that is useful for drawing
attention to air traffic in the visual field. Low update rates and long communication
delays, likewise, will produce discontinuous and slow visual feedback in response to
operator control inputs, leading to instability of manual UAV control or camera image
control and encouraging operators to adopt a "go-and-wait strategy" in manual control
(Van Erp & Van Breda, 1999). Poor spatial resolution, obviously, will impair detection of
objects that occupy only a small visual angle within an image, reducing stand-off distance
in detection of potential traffic conflicts (see 4 above). A small field of view (FOV) will
not only eliminate ambient visual information useful for assessing ego-motion necessary
at low level flight (Gibson, 1979; Wickens & Holland, 2000), but will also impose a
demand for greater amounts of camera scanning for successful traffic detection. A well-
designed system for display of sensory imagery will be required to balance the benefits
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 8

and costs of temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and FOV. To guide the design of
visual information displays, research is recommended to:

    · Determine what information is "task-critical" in manual airframe control, payload
         sensor control, and visual traffic detection (Van Breda, 2000).

    · Establish the optimal compromise between spatial resolution, temporal resolution,
         and FOV in the display of visual imagery.

    As part of this work, it will be important to establish a catalogue of mission payload
requirements that may compromise the quality of visual information for flight, and
establish the minimum necessary information (time delay and image quality) for manual
control. For different functions, sensitivity curves should be established to show
performance quality or function degradation as a function of spatial and temporal
resolution.

7. Can augmented reality displays or synthetic vision systems successfully
compensate for the degraded visual imagery provided by onboard sensors?

         As noted above (#6), low temporal resolution and delayed updating of visual
imagery received from onboard sensors will degrade manual control of airframe and
payload tasks. The judicious choice of spatial and temporal image parameters may
attenuate these effects, but is unlikely to mitigate them in full. An alternative approach to
improving visual information display may be through the use of "augmented reality"
(Milgram & Colquhoun, 1999) or "synthetic vision" (Draper, et al, 2004), in which the
real-world imagery provided by a sensor is embedded within a display of computer-
generated landmarks or objects representing the same scene. The virtue of augmented
reality in the context of UAV flight is that the computer-generated component of a
display can be updated immediately in response to control inputs from a UAV operator,
providing rapid feedback to improve manual tracking. For example, Van Erp & Van
Breda (1999) provided subjects in a simulated payload sensor control task camera
imagery overlaid by a computer-generated grid of perpendicular lines, oriented so as to
conform to the imaged scene. The synthetic grid shifted in real time following input from
the operator, giving visual feedback as to the direction and magnitude of camera
movement. As compared to a control condition with no virtual grid, augmented displays
significantly improved target tracking at low camera update rates (i.e, long sensory
delays). A study by Veltman and Oving (2002) produced similar benefits by embedding
current and predicted camera footprints within a larger map (either 2D or 3D) of the
terrain to be scanned. A still more sophisticated form of display is a fully virtual synthetic
vision system, in which terrain information is stored in databases and rendered based on
GPS position. An important issue here concerns the degree of realism with which
synthetic imagery should be presented, whether minimalist (e.g., the grid used by Van
Erp and Van Breda), or highly realistic, such as employed in current SVS systems
(Prinzel et al, 2004). The danger of the latter is that pilots may place undue trust in the
imagery, leading to cognitive tunneling and neglect of information not available within
such a high imagery display (e.g., a "transponder off" aircraft; Thomas and Wickens,
2004). Augmented displays thus present a promising method of enabling good UAV
operator performance, but are not without potential costs. Research is thus recommended
to:
                                                                            Human Factors of UAVs 9

    · Further develop and test predictive augmented displays to improve airframe and
         payload sensor control.

    · Determine the effects of display format/fidelity on the UAV operator's level of
         trust in the automated system.

8. Can multimodal display technology be used to compensate for the dearth of
sensory information available to a UAV operator?

         One of the primary consequences of the separation between aircraft and operator
is that the operator is deprived of a range of sensory cues available to the pilot of a
manned vehicle. Rather than receiving direct sensory input from the environment in
which his vehicle is embedded, the UAV pilot receives only that information provided by
onboard sensors via datalink. As noted above, this consists primarily of potentially
degraded visual imagery covering a relatively small FOV. Sensory cues that are lost thus
include ambient visual input, kinesthetic/vestibular information, and sound, all of which
are valuable in maintaining operator awareness of the environmental and system
conditions (e.g., turbulence, icing). As compared to the operator of a manned aircraft,
therefore, a UAV operator can be said to function in relative "sensory isolation" from the
aircraft under his control. It is critical in light of this for UAV system developers to
design displays and alarms to keep operators well-informed of system status and aware of
potential system failures.

         Visual displays provide one method of presenting a UAV operator with sensor
information beyond that conveyed by imagery from a vehicle-mounted camera. Data
suggest, however, that UAV operators may not optimally modify their visual scanning
strategies to compensate for the absence of multisensory cues (Tvaryanas, 2004).
Moreover, the task of creating an "ecological", intuitively-interpreted visual
representation for such information is often difficult. An alternative way to compensate
UAV operators for the lack of direct sensory input from the vehicle's environment could
be through the use of multimodal (e.g., tactile or auditory) information displays. For
example, fly by wire controls have long been equipped with augmented force feedback
mimicking the forces experienced on the air surfaces of manned aircraft, and roughly
capturing the changes in handling quality. Ruff, et al (2000) examined the value of haptic
displays for alerting UAV operators to the onset of turbulence. Their data revealed that
haptic alerts, conveyed via the UAV operator's joystick, could indeed improve self-rated
situation awareness during turbulent conditions in a simulated UAV approach and
landing task. Interestingly, this was true despite the fact that the haptic signals were not
designed to closely simulate or mimic the veridical haptic information experienced by the
pilot of a manned vehicle. The benefits of haptic displays, however, were obtained only
under limited circumstances (specifically, only when turbulence occurred far from the
runway), and were offset by an increase in the subjective difficulty of landing. These
results suggest some value of multi-modal displays as a method of compensating for
sensory cues typically denied to a UAV operator, but also indicate that such displays may
not be universally valuable and may carry costs as well as benefits.

         A related point is that multimodal displays may be useful not simply as a means
to compensate for the UAV operator's impoverished sensory environment, but more
generally to reduce cognitive-perceptual workload levels. Studies by Calhoun, et al
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 10

(2002), Sklaar and Sarter (1999), and Wickens and Dixon (2002; Dixon & Wickens,
2003; Wickens, Dixon, & Chang, 2003), for example, have found that auditory and tactile
displays can improve aspects of flight control and system monitoring.

         In sum, research is necessary to:
     · Further develop techniques for multimodal information display.
     · Assess the value of multimodal displays in countering UAV operators' sensory

         isolation.
     · Assess the more general value of multimodal displays in distributing workload

         optimally across cognitive-perceptual channels.

9. To what extent can displays and controls be standardized across UAV systems?
What level of standardization should be mandated? (Basic T instrument panel?
HUD overlay?)

         We anticipate a tendency for vendors to produce novel designs for the interface,
particularly, given the diversity of specialized payload missions for which UAVs may be
designed. It is essential to establish certain commonalities across all interfaces. Exactly
what these should be remains a question for research. Questions to be considered include,
but are not limited to:

    · Should the "basic T" always be maintained?
    · Is an inside-out attitude display necessary, given that the pilot is no longer inside

         the vehicle?
    · Should certain information always be visible (never hidden to be retrieved by

         menu navigation)?
    · Should all aspects of the payload display be kept spatially separated from the

         primary flight display, or are HUD overlays advisable?
    · Should certain controls (e.g., a joystick) be mandatory for certain functions, and

         should others be prohibited (e.g., mouse for flight control)?
     Identification of these issues recognizes that no single display layout or control
assignment is optimal for all tasks, but also recognizes that certain cases of inconsistency
can lead to negative transfer and pilot error, as pilots transfer from one interface to
another. Similar issues have been addressed in assigning common type ratings and
differences training in commercial manned aircraft.

10. What are the consequences for system safety of pilot judgment when the pilot no
longer has a "shared fate" with the vehicle? Will there be subtle shifts in risk taking
that might affect overall airspace safety?

         UAV pilots will not be at risk for injury or death if their aircraft crashes, in
contrast to the circumstances of manned aircraft pilots, who "share fate" with their
aircraft. This difference could, in theory, impose a substantial difference in risk taking
tendencies, in such areas as the decision to carry out a flight into bad weather (Goh &
Wiegmann, 2001; Weigmann, Goh, & O'Hare, 2002). Such differences may be further
amplified by the sensory isolation described previously. Research is thus recommended
to:

    · Determine how the UAV operator's risk perception and risk taking behavior are
         affected by absence of shared fate with his/her vehicle.
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 11

    · Determine how the UAV operator's risk perception and risk taking behavior are
         affected by the absence of sensory/perceptual cues.

AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PROCEDURAL ISSUES
11. How will hand-offs between crews be accomplished during long-endurance
flights?

         Long-distance and/or long-endurance UAV flight will require the frequent
transfer of control between operators, generally taking one of three forms (Kevin
Williams, personal communication). First, control may be passed from one ground
control station to another. Second, control may be passed from one crew of operators to
another within the same ground control station. Finally, control may be passed from one
operator to another within a crew. The transfer of control will likely constitute a critical
and high-workload phase of UAV operations. Indeed, a number of military UAV
accidents have occurred during transfer of control from one team of operators to another,
generally because the station receiving control was not properly configured (Williams,
2004). Research is necessary to establish procedures for the safe handoff of control
between UAV crews. More specifically, this work should:

    · Develop and test formal procedures for handoff of UAV control between teams of
         operators.

    · Develop and test displays, automation, and procedures to ensure that the operators
         receiving UAV control are adequately informed of system status and are alerted to
         discrepancies in system configuration between control stations relinquishing and
         assuming vehicle control.

12. What are the effects of variable total loop time delays on response to ATC
instructions?

         Datalink delays may be expected to add as many as several seconds to the
communications loop between UAV operators and ATC. The magnitude of these delays,
however, will be variable, and may not always be predictable to human operators. Thus,
controllers may have greater difficulty in compensating for these delays than they do in
compensating for the fixed response characteristics of a given class of aircraft. Potential
compensatory responses to communication delays are changes in the timing with which
ATC commands are issued and acted upon, and changes in the communications flow
between ATC and UAV operators (Kiekel, Gorman, & Cooke, 2004; Rantanen McCarley
& Xu, 2004). To anticipate and accommodate the effects of communications delays, it
will be necessary to understand and take account of these compensatory behaviors and
their consequences for system performance. Research should thus be conducted to:

    · Determine what compensatory behaviors, if any, air traffic controllers' and UAV
         operators' adopt in response to communication delays.

    · Determine the effects of communications delays on the flow of air traffic.
Computer simulation models of communications may be particularly effective tools here,
so long as such models are based on empirically validated estimates of human response
time, variability, and reliability (probability of communications error).
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 12

13. What form of predictable autonomous behavior should a UAV adopt following a
loss of ground-to-air communications? How should the UAV operator be alerted to
a loss of ground-to-air communications?

    One particularly disruptive scenario of UAV automation failure is a total severing of
the GC-UAV control loop. It is important that the vehicle behave predictably under such
circumstances. This is a human factors issue because such default rules are of critical
importance to the ATC/ATM who must manage traffic based on the knowledge of these
rules (Shively, 2004). It is also important, clearly, that the UAV operator become aware
of the communications loss as rapidly as possible. Research is therefore necessary to:

    · Determine what behavior UAV be programmed to adopt by default in case of a
         total communications loss with ground control station (Continue to fly on a
         straight path? Descend? Fly toward the nearest equipped airfield?).

    · Develop displays, automation, and/or procedures by which the UAV operator can
         be made aware of a communications loss, and be provided estimates of its
         potential causes and consequences.

CREW QUALIFICATIONS
14. How many members will each crew comprise, and what will be each
crewmember's responsibilities? Can an operator supervise multiple UAVs
simultaneously while maintaining an acceptable level of performance?

         Military UAV crews for reconnaissance missions typically include both an air
vehicle operator and a mission payload operator (Draper, et al, 2000; Mouloua et al,
2003). Such crew structure is reasonable in light of findings that the assignment of
airframe and payload control to the same operator can substantially degrade performance
(Van Breda, 1995, cited in Van Erp & Van Breda, 1999). For UAV flight in civilian
airspace, however, the size of the crew complement necessary for each vehicle is likely to
be contingent on the nature and goals of the flight task (e.g., surveillance vs. long-
distance transport vs. station keeping for telecommunications). Although some research
has demonstrated possibility of single pilot-multiple UAV (1-to-many) control
(Cummings and Guerlain, 2004; Galster, et al, 2001; Wickens, et al, 2003), these
successes pre-suppose three circumstances: (1) closely coordinated and correlated
activities among the multiple UAVs (Cummings & Guerlain, 2004), (2) operation in a
disturbance free (closed) environment, such as very high altitudes, (3) high levels of
reliable automation (Dixon and Wickens, 2004). When any of these three characteristics
are not in force, and, in particular, when one UAV enters a failure mode, the ability of the
pilot to monitor others in a 1-to-many configuration is severely compromised.
Furthermore, even in a 1-to-1 configuration, performance of concurrent tasks is
dramatically degraded when heavy demands are imposed on the single operator by
complex payload operations (e.g., manipulating camera imagery) (Dixon and Wickens,
2004). In light of this, research is necessary to:

    · Delineate circumstances under which multiple responsibilities (e.g., flight control,
         conflict detection, payload control) be safely assigned to a single UAV operator,
         and circumstances under which such responsibilities should be distributed across
         two or more crew members.

And, by extension:
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 13

    · Delineate circumstances under which a single operator can safe hold
         responsibility for multiple UAVs simultaneously.

It is crucial that such research consider circumstances under which automation is
imperfect (#2), and that it address the potential cost of communications and teamwork
between multiple operators (Kiekel, et al, 2004).

15. What are the core knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that should be
required for UAV pilot certification? What KSAs should be required for
certification to fly particular UAV systems or classes of systems?

         Research is necessary to:
    · Determine the general KSAs that will be required of all UAV operators.
    · Determine KSAs required for certification to operate specified classes or systems

         of UAV.

16. How should UAV operators be trained? What constitutes an appropriate
regimen of ground school, simulator, and flight experience for UAV flight
certification?

         Safe flight of unmanned vehicles in the national airspace will demand effective
procedures for UAV pilot training. Ryder, et al (2001) note that because the task demands
of operating a UAV from a ground control console are similar during simulated and real
flight, simulator experience is likely to constitute a greater portion of training for pilots of
unmanned vehicles than for pilots of manned aircraft. As noted below (#17), furthermore,
experience piloting manned aircraft appears to produce positive but imperfect positive
transfer to UAV flight (Schreiber, et al, 2002). Research is needed to:

    · Optimize simulation systems for UAV pilot training and test their adequacy
    · Establish requirements for flight training outside the simulator.
    · Determine to what extent manned pilot experience should offset training

         requirements for UAV certification.

17. Should experience piloting a manned aircraft be prerequisite for UAV pilot
certification?

         Past research has come to conflicting conclusions as to whether UAV operators
will benefit from experience piloting a manned aircraft. Schreiber, et al (2002) examined
the effects of prior flight experience on novice operators' skill acquisition and transfer in
a Predator UAV simulation. In general, flight experience reduced the number of training
trials required for operators to reach a criterion level of performance on a set of basic
maneuvering and landing tasks, and improved operator performance on a subsequent
reconnaissance task. Other findings, however, have suggested that UAV operators need
not be rated aviators. Using the Army's Job Assessment Software System (JASS),
Barnes, et al (2000) elicited Hunter UAV operators ratings of the relative importance of
various cognitive skills in UAV air vehicle operators. Ratings indicated that outside of
communication skills, raters did not consider flight-related skills of great importance to
UAV operations, leading the authors to conclude that selection of rated aviators as air
vehicle operators would be of little value.
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 14

         The apparent discrepancy in the conclusions reached by Schreiber, et al (2002)
and Barnes, et al (2000) may be due, at least in part, to differences in the operation of the
UAV systems under consideration; while the Predator is piloted manually via a stick and
rudder interface similar to that of a manned aircraft, the Hunter is guided by automation
that allows the operator to select flight parameters using knobs on the GCS console. The
value of prior flight experience to a UAV operator, that is, may depend in part on
similarity between the manned and unmanned systems. Research is necessary to:

    · Determine whether and how much experience piloting a manned system should
         be required for UAV pilot certification.

    · Determine whether prerequisite levels of flight experience, if any, should vary
         across UAV platforms.

18. What medical qualifications should a UAV operator be required to meet?
         Although issues of high altitude physiology and medication induced vestibular

disruption are not relevant to UAV pilots, some forms medical qualifications are likely to
remain necessary. Research is necessary to:

    · Determine whether medical standards for UAV operators should be in any ways
         less or more strict than for pilots of manned aircraft.

    · Establish special duty limits for long duration missions.

Comparing three variants of a computational process model of basic aircraft
maneuvering. Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Behavior Representation in
Modeling and Simulation.
The paper uses an ACT-R model to examine expert/novice differences and effects of
control strategy on Predator UAV flight. Three models were developed. Model P
(performance only) lacked the knowledge of control instrument settings that is
characteristic of expert pilots, and therefore could only rely on performance indicators in
maneuvering the aircraft. Model CP (Control + Performance) had knowledge of control
and performance settings needed to achieve aircraft behavior, and therefore could rely on
a control and performance strategy. However, the model did not remain focused on
control indicator after making adjustment to it, but continued with normal crosscheck and
checked to see if manipulation had its intended when attention eventually returned to the
indicator. Model CFP (Control Focus & Performance) was similar to model CP, except
that it remained focus on control instrument until it was properly set. This was in addition
to normal crosscheck.

To examine expert/novice differences, the authors compared Model P to Model CP. To
examine strategic effects, they compared Model CP to Model CFP.

Results
Performance was better for Model P than for Model CP on 6 of 7 maneuvers. Model P
was better on the most complex (three-axis) maneuver, though its not clear why.
Performance was better for Model CFP than for Model CP on 5 of 7 maneuvers.
Performance on other two maneuvers was similar. Overall, Model CFP performed the
most like human subject matter experts.

Experiment 1
Assessed the importance of using rated aviators for air vehicle operator (AVO) and
external pilot (EP) positions in the Hunter UAV. The AVO tasks are to design mission
plans in collaboration with commander, fly the UAV after take-off, and set course to
waypoints. The AVO must be able to read the instruments, understand flight status,
coordinate with the mission payload operator (MPO) when reaching target area, and
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 20

respond to emergencies and make course changes when necessary. However, the AVO
does not fly the vehicle using stick-and-rudder controls, in the manner of a typical pilot.
The EP is responsible for take-off and landing, using a controller similar to that for model
airplanes. Most flight safety problems occur during the times that the EP is in control,
primarily because take-off and landing are inherently difficult.

The study used the Army's Job Assessment Software System (JASS) to determine what
cognitive skills are important for the AVO and EP positions. JASS collects ratings about
the degree to which various skills and abilities are necessary to perform a given task. The
skills/abilities rated by JASS fall into six categories: communication, speed-loaded,
reasoning, visual, auditory, and psychomotor. JASS data were supplemented with
enhanced computer-aided testing (ECAT) data from an earlier study. The ECAT data
were one- and two-handed tracking scores, which were correlated with failure rates for
EP training.

21 subjects were AVO & MPO designated; 11 gave ratings of AVO task structure, 10
gave ratings of MPO task structure. 9 subjects were certified EPs, and gave ratings of EP
task structure. 16 fixed- or rotary-wing Army aviators also rated EP skills. ECAT data
came from a sample of 28 students in Pioneer and Hunter UAV EP training courses. Six
of these failed the course.

Results
AVO raters did not rate flight-related tasks as overly demanding on any of the six skill
sets except communication. The EP task was rated as more demanding than AVO task on
all skill sets. EP subjects were broken into 4 groups: EP low experience, EP high
experience, fixed-wing aviators, and rotary-wing aviators. Aviators gave slightly higher
ratings to reasoning skills than did EPs. The EP low experience group gave especially
high ratings to vision, audition, and psychomotor skills. Experienced EPs reported using
mostly conceptual skills during emergency situations. Inexperienced EPs reported relying
on visual & psychomotor skills.

ECAT tracking data were correlated with EP course success rates; 5 of the 6 students
who failed had tracking data near bottom of sample distribution. These findings are
consistent with the finding (noted above) that inexperienced EPs find visual and
psychomotor skills to be particularly important.

Experiment 2
Examined the potential value of imagery and intelligence analysts as components of the
UAV. The method used was to measure overlap between JASS ratings for imagery
analysts, intelligence analysts, and UAV crew task duties. Imagery analyst skill rankings
were significantly correlated with those for 2 out of 16 UAV crew duties, intelligence
analyst skill rankings were correlated with those for 14 out 16 UAV crew duties. Results
suggest that imagery analysts would complement UAV crew skill sets.

Used a computational model of human cognition (Micro Saint) to investigate workload
throughout the course of a simulated Outrider UAV flight mission. Also considered
remarks from subject matter experts (SMEs). Results suggest that candidate tasks for
automation included pre- and post-flight procedures & checks, verification of system
settings, and computer checks of mission plans. SMEs reported that they did not want full
automation, but preferred instead to retain decision making authority themselves. To
reduce workload, they suggested making the computer interface faster and letting the
automation provide backup check for safety problems.

Subjects performed a compensatory tracking task in conjunction with a monitoring task.
Study compared the value of visual, tactile, and combined visual/tactile alerts for
identifying which of four scales exceeded normal range in the monitoring task. In the
visual condition, subject was required to monitor the scales. In the tactile condition,
subject received pulse train alert of fault, with location and frequency of train indicating
which scale was beyond normal range of values.

Results
Response time to faults was faster and RMS tracking error was reduced with tactile cues
compared to visual cues. Subjective ratings also strongly preferred the tactile cues.

Experiment 1
Examined the value of aural and tactile alerts, presented redundantly with visual cues, to
signal warnings during a simulated UAV control task. Subjects performed a continuous
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 22

UAV control task. While doing this, they were required to respond to occasional (3-4 per
minute) data entry tasks. Two kinds of data entry task were used:
1) Warning response task Subject determined whether warning level was caution (20-24
per trial) or critical (3 per trial), then responded by entering an appropriate sequence of
keys.
2) Radio frequency task Subjects heard call signs, followed by a combination of color &
number. On events with call sign Eagle, subject was required to select the appropriate
color/number coordinate on the HDD using a mouse. On low auditory load trials, only the
call sign Eagle events were used. On high auditory load trials, distractors events with
different call signs were interposed.
3) Data query task Simultaneous visual/voice commands specified data for subject to
retrieve from HDD and enter via keypad.

Primary manipulation of interest was in the warning response task. In baseline condition,
caution signals were specified by yellow visual cue and redundant Type I aural cue,
critical signals were specified by red visual cue and the Type I aural cue. In +2nd aural
condition, caution signals were specified by yellow visual cue and redundant Type I aural
cue, critical signals were specified by red visual cue and the Type 2 aural cue. In +Tactile
condition, caution signals were specified by yellow visual cue and redundant Type I aural
cue, critical signals were specified by red visual cue and tactile cue.

Results
+2nd aural and +Tactile conditions produced shorter RTs than baseline condition (p < .05
and p < .10). Baseline was also subjectively rated as less salient than the other two
conditions. +2nd aural and +Tactile were not significantly different. +2nd aural and
+Tactile improved performance in the radio frequency task under high auditory load
conditions. Flight performance was not affected by alert condition.

Experiment 2
The second experiment was conducted to examine the interaction of cue format and
auditory load more closely. Method was similar to that the Experiment 1, except that 1)
no auditory cue was used in the baseline condition, 2) only critical cues (no caution cues)
were used, 3) high auditory load was more difficulty, 4) aural and tactile cues were
matched for salience by a pilot study, 5) a visual IFF status probe task was added.

Results
+Aural and +Tactile conditions produced shorter RTs than baseline condition, and were
rated as more salient. No differences obtained between +Aural and +Baseline conditions.
Baseline condition also produced higher subjective workload. Low auditory load in
general produced better self-rated SA and task performance and lower workload, but did
not interact with cue format, contrary to findings of Experiment 1.

Paper presented at the Second Annual Autonomous Intelligent Networked Systems
Conference.
Discusses issues related to supervisory control of swarming UAVs, i.e., groups of UAVs
with some level of autonomous inter-vehicle collaboration. Collaboration between UAVs
introduces another layer of automation into UAV control task. At the minimum level of
of network autonomy, there is no collaboration between UAVs. At the maximum level,
vehicles are in full collaboration and there is no need for human intervention in emergent
situations.

Increasing inter-vehicle collaboration does not necessarily increase automation level for
the system as a whole. At the lowest level of inter-vehicle collaboration, automation can
range from SV levels 1-10. At highest levels, it can range from levels 7-10. The effects of
automation of full system and of inter-vehicle communication must be considered in
system design.

DOD recognizes the need for a standard UAV interface that provides critical SA and
location data to support airspace integration. Swarming UAVs will be tasked to optimize
multi-objective cost functions, and central issue in maintaining SA will be to provide
visualization tools that communicate cost function info to UAV operator. It will also be
necessary to provide interactive sensitivity analysis tools to determine how human
adjustments of variables could change overall cost function.

for supervisory control of autonomous vehicles. Manuscript under review.
An experiment assessed operators' ability to control multiple autonomous aircraft.
Subjects performed a supervisory task that required them to control and occasionally re-
target multiple Tomahawk missiles. Commands and occasional queries were presented in
an onscreen chat box. Chat box responses served as a secondary task measure of
workload. Retargeting was done with a decision matrix (looks like a spreadsheet) that
allowed subjects to view information on all retargetable missiles, including how long it
would take missiles to get to target and the time remaining for the operator to retarget the
missile. Available missiles were listed in rows, potential targets were listed in columns.
Cell at the intersection of a given row and column gave info about that missile/target
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 24

pairing. Retargeting commands arrived at two tempos, low (one event every 4 minutes)
and high (one event every 2 minutes). Difficulty of task scenarios was easy, medium, or
hard.

Dependent variables were decision time for retargeting; Figure of Merit (FOM), a
weighted measure of overall performance; utilization, an objective workload measure
given by % busy time; and NASA-TLX ratings. Participants were 42 active and retired
duty Navy personnel.

Results
Decision time, FOM, and utilization scores were similar with 8 and 12 missiles, but were
degraded with 16 missiles. The effect of number of missiles on decision time was larger
as the scenario became more difficult. Subjective workload scores were not affected by
number of missiles. Results suggest that operators can manage up to 12 missiles with no
degradation. See papers by Galster, et al (2001) and Hilburn, et al (1997) for similar
conclusions from ATC domain.

Experiment compared benefits of head-slaved HMD control of UAV camera vs. joystick
control. Camera joystick was either passive, active (force feedback), or combined with
UAV control joystick. Dynamics of the joystick were either position or velocity control.
In some conditions, reference marks were included to aid perception of camera
orientation.

Results
Analysis of joystick manipulations indicated that best performance came from a passive
joystick providing position control without vehicle references. Performance on almost all
measures was superior with joystick control relative to head-slaved control.

onboard moving platforms. Proceedings HCI-Aero 2002.
An experiment examined spatial awareness of operators controlling a UAV from onboard
a moving helicopter. Displays presented a 2-D electronic map of terrain including the
UAV, helicopter, football stadium, and a column of tanks. In some conditions, a 3-D map
was presented to provide self-motion info from perspective of operator inside the
helicopter. 2-D maps varied in their center (heli-centered vs. UAV centered) and
orientation (north up vs. helicopter heading up vs. UAV heading up). The subject's task
was to monitor displays through a 40-60 s automated flight period then answer questions

about locations of various items. Questions could ask about either absolute (world-
centered) orientation or relative positions of the four items onscreen.

Results
North-up displays were better for absolute orientation questions, as assessed by angular
judgment errors and by RTs. In general, absolute judgments were slower than relative
judgments, except in case where map is north-up and there was no 3-D self-motion. 3-D
self motion increased errors in most conditions (perhaps producing an SAT in some
cases) but improved judgments of relative direction from helicopter, and had no effect on
judgments relative to the UAV.

University of Illinois, Institute of Aviation, Aviation Human Factors Division.

Employed the single-UAV task of Wickens & Dixon (2002) to examine the effects of
imperfect automated aids for detecting system failures and controlling UAV flight path.
Subjects flew simulated UAV missions to a command target (CT) locations while
concurrently searching for targets of opportunity (TOOs) and monitoring a set of gauges
for system failures (SFs). In a baseline manual condition, subjects flew without
automated aids. Three groups of subjects were provided an aid to signal system failures.
For one group, aid was perfectly reliable. For another group, aid was 67% reliable and
prone to committing false alarms. For the third group, aid was 67% reliable and prone to
committing misses. Two additional groups were provided an autopilot to control UAV
flight path. For one group, autopilot was perfectly reliable. For the other group, autopilot
was 67% reliable (i.e., prone to going off-course). A final group was provided both forms
of automation, with both being perfectly reliable.

Results
Data indicated that perfectly reliable aids improved performance relative to baseline, and
that even the imperfect autopilot was beneficial. Furthermore, automated flight control
improved performance on the concurrent TOO search task. In contrast, imperfectly
reliable aids for SF detection produced no gains relative to baseline, and even perfectly
reliable SF detection failed to improve TOO detection. Results suggest that the benefits
of later stage automation (i.e., automation of task execution) may be greater and more
robust than the benefits of early stage automation.

Employed the single-UAV task of Wickens & Dixon (2002) to examine the effects of an
imperfect automated aid for detection of system failures. Subjects flew simulated UAV
missions to a command target (CT) locations while concurrently searching for targets of
opportunity (TOOs) and monitoring a set of gauges for system failures (SFs). In A80
condition, automated aid was 80% reliable and was equally likely to commit a miss or a
false alarm. In A60f condition, aid was 60% reliable and was 3x more likely to commit a
false alarm than a miss. This should have encouraged high reliance/low compliance. In
A60m condition, aid was 60% reliable and was 3x more likely to commit a miss than a
false alarm. This should have encouraged low reliance/high compliance. In a baseline
condition, subjects performed with no automated aid.

Results
Tracking error was unaffected by automation condition.

The number of instruction refreshes (presented visually) was higher in the A60m (M =
8.5) condition than in the baseline (M = 3). The number of refreshes for A80 (M = 5.57)
and A60f (M = 5.25) conditions were marginally lower than in A60m condition, and
were non-significantly higher than in baseline condition.

TOO detection rate was higher in the A80 condition than in baseline. No other
differences in detection rate between groups were significant. TOO detection times were
higher in the A60f and A60m conditions than in baseline. Data showed a non-significant
trend toward larger decrement in A60f condition, suggesting that a high false alarm rate
induced subjects to invest more visual resources in inspecting gauges in response to an
alarm than a high miss rate did.

CT detection times were significantly and substantially (2 seconds) longer in A60f and
A60m conditions than in the baseline and A80 conditions.

SF detection rates were higher when workload was high (i.e., during loitering/inspection),
but this did not interact with automation condition. SF detection times were also higher
when workload was high, and showed an interaction with condition, reflecting the fact
that load increased detection times in A60f condition more than in any other condition.
Effects of load were similar on all other conditions. Comparison of A60f and A60m
conditions showed that in both cases, detection times were increased when automation
missed the SF. Detection times when the automation detected the failure were longer in
the A60f condition than in the A60m, reflecting greater compliance with alarms in the
later condition.

A computational model accounted for the data well. Results of the modeling suggest that
compliance and reliance are linearly related to the automation's FAR and HR,
respectively, and are largely independent of one another.

payload symbology evaluation. Paper presented at the Annual AUVSI Conference,
July 15-17, Baltimore, MD.
Compared the effects of floating compass rose and heading tape symbology on mission
payload operators' ability to respond to change commands and SA queries. Symbology
formats also differed in their representation of sensor pitch: compass rose displays gave
pitch as a digital readout, heading tape displays depicted it with a wedge representation
indicating the angle of declination. Commanded changes could be to sensor heading,
sensor pitch, sensor heading relative to air vehicle (sensor bearing angle), or to AV
heading. MPO did not perform AV heading changes, but called them out to confederate
pilot. Subjective measures of workload (NASA-TLX) and SA (SART) were also
collected.

Results
Changes to sensor heading and sensor bearing angle were more accurate with heading
tape than with compass rose symbology, with no SAT. Unexpectedly, changes to sensor
pitch were more accurate with compass rose symbology. Post-experiment interviews with
subjects suggest this might be due to size and gradient of marked increments on heading
tape symbology. Control reversals were more frequent with compass rose than with
heading tape. SA probes didn't show much, and no differences were found in subjective
ratings.

Manual versus speech input for unmanned aerial vehicle control station operations.
Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 47th Annual Meeting,
109-113.
Employed a UAV simulation to examine benefits of manual (keyboard) and speech input
modalities for intermitted data entry tasks during a continuous flight/navigation control
task. A manual command comprised a series of button presses. A voice command
comprised a single word or short phrase. Subjects received intermittent signals to perform
data entry tasks during flight task. A response to each alert was required within 10
seconds, and the task was required to be completed within an allotted amount of time
thereafter. A failure to acknowledge alert was considered a miss, and a failure to
complete the task was considered a time-out.

Results
Task completion times were on average 40% shorter with voice commands. Benefits
ranged in magnitude from 3.14 to 21.43 seconds. Number of time-outs was almost 10
times higher with manual entry (M = .95 vs. M = .1), and the number of tasks completed
incorrectly was approximately 23 times greater. Response time to alerts was faster for
manual entry mode, but difference was less than 1 second. RMS airspeed error, path
error, and altitude error were all smaller in speech entry conditions. Subjective data also
favored speech entry.

As study was devised, speech entry mode generally required fewer commands than
manual entry. Data do not indicate if speech entry would still be superior if modalities
were equated for number of steps required to execute commands.

Display concepts supporting crew communications of target location in unmanned
air vehicles. Proceedings of the IEA 2000/ HFES 2000 Congress, 3.85 - 3.88.
UAVs for intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) usually have two
operators, a sensor operator (SO) and an air vehicle operator (AVO). The AVO controls
the airframe, monitors subsystems, and communicates with the ground control station
(GCS). The SO searches for targets using a UAV-mounted camera.

The AVO generally views scene with a larger FOV than the SO, and can therefore assist
in target detection by directing the SO's attention to targets outside the SO's current FOV.
Usually, the AVO attempts to communicate the target location verbally. The goal of
paper was to assess a pair of display concepts meant to facilitate AVO/SO
communication about target location. Two kinds of advanced displays were tested:

    · Compass rose overlay on the SO's camera display Allows AVO to give direction
         in world-centered references (N, S, E, W), and should make translation to screen-
         centered references easier for the SO

    · Telestrator Allows AVO to designate target location on his display using a mouse,
         then presents a locator line on the SO's display indicating the direction and
         distance in which SO should shift camera to find target

Four conditions were tested: baseline (control), compass rose, telestrator, compass rose +
telestrator

Results
Telestrator reduced the time necessary to designate the target, improved camera path
efficiency improved, and reduced workload. Compass rose was of little benefit.

Robots, 11, 9-18.
Paper discusses various forms of interfaces for vehicle teleoperation. These include:

    · Direct Operator manually controls aircraft, typically using controls that are
         similar to those of a manned vehicle. This form of control/interface is appropriate
         when 1) real-time human control or intervention is required, and 2) the control
         station and vehicle are connected by a high-bandwidth, low-delay
         communications link.

    · Multimodal/multisensor Multimodal interfaces "provide the operator with a
         variety of control modes (individual actuator, coordinated motion, etc.) and
         displays (text, visual, etc.)...Multisensor displays combine information from
         several sensors or data sources to present a single integrated view."

    · Supervisory control Operator specifies subtasks which the vehicle then performs
         on its own. This is appropriate when datalink bandwidth is low or
         communications are delayed.

    · Novel These include psychophysiologically-driven control, gesture-based control,
         web-based interfaces, PDA-based interfaces.

alerts for monitoring tasks in complex systems.
An earlier study (Calhoun, et al, 2002) found that tactile alerts could speed detection of
system faults in a multi-task environment. In that experiment, subjects were required to
detect & identify system faults while also performing a manual tracking task. Two tactors
were used to signal four possible system faults: combination of tactor location and
vibration frequency signaled which of four system parameters was in fault. Performance
was best (RT shortest) when one tactor was located on each arm. When both were on a
single arm, performance was better with the right than the left arm.

In the study described above, all participants were right-handed. Additionally, manual
tracking was performed with the right hand. The current study was conducted to
determine if similar results would obtain for A) left-handed subjects, and B) when subject
performed the tracking task using the left hand.

Results
RTs were shortest when tactors were located on different arms. When they were on the
same arm, there was no significant difference in RTs for left & right arms. Hand used for
tracking did not have any affect on RT to faults.

and operation of uninhabited aerial vehicles. AUVSI '98: Proceedings of the
Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, 431-438.
The author discusses a number of unique human factors concerns unique to UAV flight.
These include:

    · Data link drop outs may be difficult for operator to notice.
    · UAV mission times may exceed human vigilance capability.
    · Humans can attend to/inspect only one stream of images at a time, while some

         UAVs may provide multiple image streams.
    · Operators are sometimes given with unprioritized lists of multiple of targets to

         search for. This may be especially problematic when the operator is asked to
         control multiple UAVs simultaneously.
    · Crew coordination depends on appropriate communications flow between crew
         members, which can be difficult when crew is large or when crew members are
         not co-located.
    · Visual imagery is difficult to obtain during rocket launching or UAV, and during
         net or cable arrest. Workload is also high during launch and recovery. Finally,
         small sensor FOV can reduce SA and make navigation, target acquisition, and
         traffic detection difficult.
    · Manual control of vehicles with time delays is difficult.
    · Control interface on some systems is poorly designed.
    · Software is not standardized, even between instances of the same UAV system.

(2003). A computational process model of basic aircraft maneuvering. Proceedings
of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling, 117-122.
Paper presents an ACT-R model of Predator UAV flight. The model is based on
simulation used to train Air Force Predator operators. The simulation involves three
tasks: basic maneuvering, landing, and reconnaissance. The modeling effort presented in
this paper focuses on basic maneuvering. Pilot is required to make constant-rate changes
in airspeed, altitude, and heading. A total of seven maneuvers are involved. The first
three require pilot to change one flight parameter and hold the other two constant. The
second three maneuvers require pilot to change two flight parameters and hold third
constant. The seventh maneuver requires the pilot to change all three flight parameters
simultaneously.

The model uses a flight strategy called "Control and Performance Concept". First, the
operator establishes appropriate control settings for desired performance. Next, the
operator cross checks instruments to determine if the desired performance is being
achieved. The rationale is that control instruments have a first-order effect on aircraft
behavior, which shows up only as a second-order effect in performance instruments.

Results
RMSD for airspeed, altitude, and heading were normalized and summed to provide an
overall measure of performance. Grand mean performance on this measure over 20 runs
of the model was almost identical to grand mean performance of 7 subjects. Across
maneuvers, r-squared for predicting human performance from model was .64. The model
was also sensitive to maneuver complexity in the same way that human subjects were,
showing better performance for one-axis maneuvers than for two axis-maneuvers and
better performance for two-axis maneuvers than for three-axis maneuvers.

Evaluation of latent-semantic analysis-based measures of team communications.
Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 47th Annual Meeting,

The authors used Latent Semantic Analysis to develop methods of assessing
communications content between team members in a Predator UAV simulation.
Measures used were communications density (CD), the average task relevance of the
team's communications, and lag coherence (LC), a measure of task-relevant topic-
shifting. Data came from two experiments in which teams of three-operators (air vehicle
operator, payload operator, and navigator) flew simulated Predator UAV reconnaissance
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 32

missions. In the second experiment, workload levels were manipulated (low vs. high) and
some teams of operators were distributed rather than colocated.

Results
Communications density
Team performance in Experiment 1 was related to CD by a quadratic function, indicating
that beyond some point performance declined with additional communication. Similar
results were found for co-located and low-workload teams in Experiment 2. Under high-
workload conditions, performance continued to increase as CD increased, showing no
evidence of a quadratic trend or an optimal CD level. Data from distributed team
conditions was too noisy to interpret clearly.

Lag coherence
Coherence was positively correlated with team performance, indicating that low-
performing teams tend to shift topics more within a short window than high-performing
teams.

environmental and egocentric references frames in cardinal direction judgments.
Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 7, 251-266.
Navigational tasks often require operators to make cardinal direction judgments, which
data suggest are difficult. The goal of the experiments reported here was to examine the
strategies by which people make cardinal direction judgments.

Experiment 1
Subjects performed a static judgment task. Stimuli each trial were A) a north-up map
showing their aircraft and a footprint of a forward-facing vehicle-mounted camera, and
B) a 3-D view of the terrain as seen through the vehicle-mounted camera. The view
presented each trial contained a building with a parking lot on each side (N, S, E, W).
One of the parking lots contained vehicles while the others were empty. The subjects' job
was to indicate the cardinal direction of the occupied parking lot, relative to the building.
Results
Three noteworthy effects were evident in both the error rate and the RT data. The first
was a misalignment effect, whereby performance declined as camera heading deviated
from north-up. The second was a south-advantage effect, whereby performance was
substantially better when camera was oriented south than when it was at nearby
orientations. The third was cardinal-direction advantage effect, whereby judgments were
more slightly accurate when the camera was oriented east or west than when it was at
nearby orientations.

Experiment 2
The goal of experiment 2 was to determine if dynamic spatial information, such as that
provided by controlling a vehicle, improves cardinal direction judgments. The dynamic
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 33

task used was a simulated UAV mission. Subjects were provided three visual channels,
A) a north-up map similar to that used in Experiment 1, B) a 3-D view of terrain from a
rotatable vehicle-mounted camera, similar to that used in Experiment 1, and C) a standard
flight display. The subjects' task was to pilot the UAV to a 10 target objects and answer
questions about each one. Three of the 10 questions required cardinal direction
judgments.

Subjects also performed a static judgment task identical to that of Experiment 1.

Results
Static judgment task replicated the results of the first experiment. Cardinal-direction
judgments in the dynamic task showed effects similar to those of the static task, though
the cardinal direction advantage was weaker.

Experiment 3
Subjects performed the cardinal direction task of Experiment 1 and 2 while providing
verbal protocols.

Results
Protocols gave evidence for final strategies. The first was a mental rotation strategy,
whereby subjects mentally transformed images to be in alignment with one another and
north-up. The second was a heading referencing strategy, whereby subjects assigned the
current heading to the forward view in the camera, then making judgments relative to that
heading ("If forward is northeast, then this is north [pointing to the upper left lot], and
this is east [pointing to the upper right lot]." The third was a south-reversal strategy,
whereby subjects noted that camera heading was south and then reversed the answers
they would have given for a northward heading (this was possible only when camera was
oriented toward the south, obviously). The final strategy was a north-heading strategy,
whereby subjects noted that camera was oriented to the north and then simply made
judgments within a canonical north-up frame.

advanced cueing interfaces. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics
Society 46th Annual Meeting, 1541-1545.
The authors note that UAV operators will probably spend much of their time in
supervisory control mode, but will be required to switch to manual control suddenly in
response to system malfunctions, target acquisition, enemy actions, and other intermittent
events. As such, UAV operation will be a form of vigilance task. The goals of study were
A) to examine value of display type (cognitive or sensory) on performance in a vigilance
task and in subsequent manual control mode, B) to compare the effects of visual,
auditory, and haptic cueing of target location in a 360 degree target acquisition task.

Subjects flew simulated UAV missions. In supervisory control mode, they were required
to monitor a stream of digit pairs for a threat warning indicating the presence of an enemy
aircraft. In the sensory task, the threat warning was signaled by a size difference between
the two digits. In the cognitive task, the threat warning was signaled by an even-odd digit
pairing. After detecting a threat warning, the subject was required to target the hostile
aircraft with a joystick-controlled crosshair. In the visual cueing condition, a locator line
on the bottom right of screen indicated the direction of the target. In the auditory cueing
condition, broadband noise pulses were presented from the target location. In the haptic
cueing condition, force feedback on control stick guided the subject toward the target. In
the control condition, no cueing was provided.

Results
Hit rates for warnings showed no effect of signal rate, but a significant benefit of sensory
display format relative to the cognitive format. False alarms were lower for cognitive
than for sensory displays. Target acquisition times were shorter for sensory displays than
for cognitive. Visual, auditory, & haptic cue conditions produced similar benefits in
target acquisition times, all of which were shorter than in control condition. Subjective
workload was higher with cognitive than with sensory displays.

co-located and distributed command and control teams during a communication
channel glitch. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 48th
Annual Meeting, 683-687.
An experiment used communication flow measures developed by the authors in earlier
papers to examine effects of co-location and communication channel disruptions on team
communications in a simulated UAV recon task. Teams of three members flew a
simulated UAV, taking pictures of target items. Each team comprised three members: the
data exploitation, mission planning and control (DEMPC) member planned the route, air
vehicle operator (AVO) flew the aircraft, and the payload operator (PLO) controlled the
camera and took pictures. Manipulations were A) teams colocated vs. teams distributed,
B) workload high vs. low (workload effect not further discussed in this paper), and C)
communications normal or disrupted by glitch in channel from DEMPC to AVO.

Three types of analysis were conducted. The first used Pathfinder algorithm to identify
common sequences of communications events: XLoop (person X begins and ends a
communication, then begins another), XYcycle (person X produces a complete
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 36

communication, then person Y does), and XiY (person X interrupts person Y). CHUMS
analysis measured the stability of communications, as reflected in the relative proportion
of speech produced by each member in a one-minute window. Analysis of dominance
measured the influence that each team member's communications had over other
member's.

Expectation was that occurrence of glitch would modify communication pattern, that
DEMPC should have high dominance score, and that dominance of DEMPC should drop
in distributed teams and when glitch occurs.

Results
Pathfind analysis found that colocated teams produced more utterances in general than
distributed teams. Glitch causes decrease in DAcycles (communications between
DEMPC and AVO), increase in DPcycles, increase in PAcycles, and decrease in
PDcycles. This is generally what would be expected if communications that normally
would have gone from DEMPC to AVO were re-routed through the PLO following the
glitch.

CHUMS analysis produced more models for distributed teams, suggesting less stable
communications patterns. The communications glitch also reduced stability.

Analysis of dominance found that in co-located teams under normal conditions, the
DEMPC is moderately dominant and the AVO is reactive. In distributed teams under
normal conditions, AVO is distributed and DEMPC is reactive. During the
communications glitch, co-located teams become AVO dominant and PLO reactive.

Meeting, 1433-1437.
Subjects performed a target acquisition task in a UAV simulation. A large FOV display
was presented with a monocular HMD. Image was provided by the UAV's gimbaled
camera, with camera control by operator's head movements. After spotting a potential
target in the HMD, the operator was required to ID and designate it on a high-resolution,
small FOV CRT display with camera view controlled by joysticks. Several dependent
variables recorded. Of primary interest were effects of dominance of HMD viewing eye
on performance.

Results
Eye-dominance had no effect.

Proceedings of the Second Human Performance, Situation Awareness, and
Automation Conference (HPSAA II), Daytona Beach, FL, March 22-25.
Discusses "delegation" as a technique for control of multiple UAVs. Characteristics of
delegation are that supervisor sets agenda for subordinates, but subordinates are given
authority to decide exactly how to carry out commands. The authors note five
manners/components of delegation that can be employed in varying combinations:
1. Stipulation of goal
2. Stipulation of a plan to perform
3. Stipulation of constraints (via specification of actions or states that should be avoided)
4. Stipulation of actions or states to be achieved (i.e., subgoals)
5. Stipulation of an objective function that will allow the subordinate to assess the
desirability of various states and actions

The authors describe their work on developing a "playbook" architecture for delegating to
UAVs. Playbook would involve assigning a name to complex behavior patterns, then
allowing UAVs to autonomously implement a play when it is called. The Playbook
system would assess the feasibility of a commanded behavior before attempting to
perform it. When given a high-level command, Playbook would assess various methods
of achieving goal, then would issues specific commands to vehicles under its control.
When given more highly-specified lower-level commands, Playbook would report to the
human operator if the commands were infeasible, or would issues the commands to the
vehicles if they were feasible, filling in additional details as necessary.

for unmanned aerial vehicle control. Paper presented at the International Society for
Optical Engineering (SPIE) conference, April 12-16, Orlando, FL.
Compared performance on a target search & ID task when subjects used a conventional
CRT display & joystick control versus when they used a head-slaved HMD. UAV flight
was automated. Subjects' task was to search for items in the virtual world display and ID
them as target, non-target, or distractor. After spotting a target or non-target, subject was
to center crosshairs on the item and press a button on control box to classify it.
Independent variables were method of display/control (CRT/joystick vs. HMD/head-
slaved), virtual world search width (2500 vs. 5000 ft.), and mission duration (3 vs. 9
minutes). Dependent variables were target detection accuracy (HR, CRR), cursor distance
(distance of crosshairs from center of object when object was classified), slant range
(distance from aircraft at which subjects were able to classify target),

Results
Accuracy was high (>98%) for both forms of display/control. However, cursor distance
was smaller and slant range was larger (i.e., performance was better in both cases) for the
CRT/joystick configuration. HMD configuration also produced higher levels of nausea,
eyestrain, disorientation, and over simulator sickness rating than the CRT configuration.

Wide search width produced smaller cursor distance than did narrow width, but effect did
not interact with any others.

(2001). Ergonomics of UAV/UCAV mission success: Considerations for data link,
control, and display issues. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics
Society 45th Annual Meeting, 144-148.

Lists a number of considerations and recommendations for optimal design of
UAV/UCAV system interface and data transfer.

Data-link timing
If satellite-UAV or UAV-UAV relays are used, variable time delays of 1 second or
longer are possible. This eliminates real-time feedback to controls inputs. One way of
circumventing this problem is to task operator with supervisory monitoring of on-board
automation using pre-programming flight parameters such as speed, altitude, direction.
Predictive graphics displays may also be useful.

Controls
Neither full automated control nor full manual control is practical. Full automation
prevents the operator from intervening in flight control when necessary, while full
manual control can produce excessive workload and make control susceptible to
communications delays. The authors recommend hybrid control in which human operator
supervises automation by calling subroutines of pre-programmed software.

Display/control interfaces should be based on a standardized group of core functions
described with common terminology. Keyboards, touchscreens, pointing devices, and
joysticks/pedals are appropriate controls, but must be designed to resist dirt, damage, etc.,
especially for field operations. Keyboard inputs should be replaced with menu- or
speech- inputs for on-line vehicle control.

Assuming semi-automatic flight, flight-management systems and terminology should
emulate that of ARINC and DOD. Since commands are anticipatory, this approach allows
for preview and escape actions. If manual flight control is used, a GCS with full-time
joystick/pedal/power controls will be necessary, and real-time communication with
UAV/UCAV will be required.

If menus are used for in-flight supervisory control, it will be necessary to determine
optimal number of menus and menu items. Five seems like reasonable starting point,
based on Miller's magic number.

Displays
Displays need to reduce and format data for easy interpretation. Other principles to
follow include minimizing scene movement & unnecessary changes in viewpoint; using
high-quality displays to help ID areas of interest; employing alerts/alarms for system
faults; providing mechanisms of selection, comparisons, parsing, scaling of displayed
info.

In addition to high-quality sensor-image displays, content should include:
    · system conditions and communications status
    · flight data
    · threat advisories
    · weapons status

situation awareness, and teaming issues for UAV/UCAV operations. Proceedings of
the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 45th Annual Meeting, 162-165.
The authors discuss UAV design considerations relevant to workload, SA, and teaming.
Some of these issues pertain specifically to combat UAVs.

Physical & cognitive workload
Assuming that the UAV control will be highly automated, then the operator's task will
consist primarily of supervisory monitoring and making small course adjustments. This is
likely to be tedious, producing vigilance failures. UAV systems must therefore be
designed not just to avoid overload, but underload as well. This might be done by
combining manual and automated control. Operator would be responsible for higher-
order tasks (target recognition, munitions deployment) and automation would be
responsible for lower-order tasks (flight control, obstacle avoidance). On-board
automation should require operator action only as needed.

Situation awareness
Poor SA is likely to contribute to UAV mishaps. One way to help maintain SA is to
provide displays that keep the operator aware of the processes being controlled by the
automation, with the goal "to make the deep relational structure of the system
environment visible to operators and help to identify options for action and indicate the
boundaries for successful performance." UAVs may also be able have and advantage
relative to manned systems in providing good SA since large numbers of on-board and
off-board sensor data streams are available.

Teaming
Research is needed to determine the appropriate crew size and structure for UAV control,
and to ensure effective communications. One particular source of miscommunication is
the large amount data provided to the various UAV operators. This demands that
important information be shared appropriately among operators. Ways to do this include
"creating a mechanism for communicating understanding the real-time situation at a
higher level across several connected teams or individuals", creating teams of specialists
for target detection/authentication and for emergency operations.

Discusses potential alternative control technologies for UAVs. These include position
and orientation tracking, eye-position tracking, speech recognition, gesture recognition,
and electrophysiological measures. The authors advocate increasingly immersive
environments for UAV pilots, with eventual possibility that alternative control
technologies will replace traditional controls. Possible impediments to these goals include
time delays in display updating, simulator sickness.

uninhabited aerial vehicles: Changes in number of vehicles and type of target
symbology. Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference

The authors describe an experiment conducted with two goals. The first was to examine
changes in performance that result from increasing the number of UAVs under an
operator's supervision. Contrary to expectations, past research (Draper, Calhoun, & Ruff,
2003) found limited performance consequences when the number of UAVs under a single
operator's supervision increased from 2 to 4. The present experiment compared
performance using 3 and 5 UAVs, in an effort to increase the workload demands of the
higher-load condition. The second was to compare performance with a novel set of
stylized icons to performance with a set of standardized icons (MIL-STD_2525B). The
authors hypothesized that the stylized icons, designed to have a physical resemblance to
the objects they represented, would produce better performance.

After training, subjects flew two missions in the Multi-modal Immersive Intelligent
Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO). One mission involved control of 3 UAVs, the
other involved control of 5 UAVs (order of missions counterbalanced). Flight control was
automated. Subjects were responsible for several additional tasks: identifying unknown
aircraft, approving replans of UAV routes, identifying and selecting targets in the
imagery from UAV sensors, completing tasks on a mission mode indicator, and counting
symbols on the Tactical Situation Display (top-down map of terrain with UAVs and
routes depicted) for later recall. Subjective workload measures were also collected.

Results
Data showed no difference between the 3 UAV and 5 UAV conditions in the number of
enemy targets identified and selected. Other dependent variables showed significant
effects favoring the 3 UAV condition. Specifically, the time to respond to unidentified
aircraft was shorter, the number of Mission Mode Indicator tasks completed was higher,
the time to check and approve UAV replan routes was shorter, and all subjective
performance measures (ratings of situation awareness, perceived task difficulty,
perceived performance, and perceived workload level) were better.

Recall of symbols on the TSD was better with the standardized icons than with the
stylized set. The authors speculate that this might have happened because the
standardized icons were easier to perceptually segregate from the background.

Used concurrent and retrospective verbal reports from subject matter experts piloting a
Predator UAV simulation to determine how accurately the lab's ACT-R model of
Predator pilot performance represents the cognition/information processing of actual
pilots.

Results
Overall, attention to performance instruments was verbalized more often than attention to
control instruments during concurrent reports. However, retrospective reports suggested
that SMEs were using the Control and Performance concept implemented by the model.
Results also demonstrate that distribution of operator attention, as reflected in concurrent
verbal reports, is influenced by goals/demands of maneuver being implemented. Ideas for
improving the cognitive model include incorporating use of trim and a metacognitive
awareness of passage-of-time to improve use of timing checkpoints for monitoring
progress toward goal.

UAV interfaces for fixed-wing mini-UAVs. Proceedings of IROS 2004, Sep 28 ­ Oct
2, Sendai, Japan.

The paper describes work prototyping and testing several forms of interface for control of
small (32" wingspan, in this case) semi-autonomous UAVs.

Control techniques
Numeric parameter-based interfaces provide text boxes in which operator types desired
flight parameters.

PDA direct manipulation interface presents fixed-horizon wing-view representation from
the viewpoint of an observer behind the UAV. Display also includes a compass and
speedometer alongside the wing-view display. The user controls the UAV through drag-
and-drop manipulation of the UAV icon or the compass/speedometer. Color differences
(blue vs. red) are used to distinguish current state of UAV from desired state specified by
user manipulation. This makes the future state of the UAV easy to predict. This interface
was also tested with a laptop using trackpad and mouse.

Voice controller is allows UAV control using a grammar of twenty words (e.g., "climb",
"go north"). Voice synthesizer provides immediate feedback in present progressive tense
(e.g., "climbing", "going north").
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 42

Attitude joystick controller mimics a fly-by-wire controller by mapping deflection in
joystick to deflection in aircraft attitude. This form of interaction is especially good for
novices, non-experience pilots.

Trackpoint controller uses a trackpoint pointing device from ThinkPad laptop, with
horizontal inputs mapped to UAV roll and vertical inputs mapped to UAV pitch.

The physical icon interface is a hand-held model of UAV. Orientation of model in 3-D
space is tracked, and converted into pitch / roll commands for UAV. Should provide good
SA since the operator is holding a representation of UAV in its actual orientation. An
accompanying (optional) display helps the user distinguish actual and desired UAV states
by presenting the current state in one color and the desired state (i.e., state of physical
icon control) in another.

Assessments
The attitude joystick, physical icon, and trackpoint controller produce the fastest operator
response times for UAV manipulations. However, these re problematic when UAV is
traveling toward the operator, since they require reversal of control inputs.

Direct manipulation interfaces are useful because they don't required sustained attention.
After the user has specified the desired UAV state, no further interaction is necessary
until another change of state is desired. This can make these interfaces especially
appropriate for control of multiple UAVs. The only difficulty is that subject must shift
gaze between interface and UAV. This creates demand for frequent accommodation
changes.

Voice control allows operator to maintain gaze on UAV, and, assuming commands can
be issued in world-centered coordinates (e.g., "go north"), does not require mental
transformation of commands depending on heading of UAV.

Parameter based interfaces are difficult because they require operator to type, and also
demand mental math.

Experiment 1
Examined the effects of automation on task completion time and subjective workload
levels in control of 2 or 4 UAVs. Two levels of automation (LOA) were compared,
management by consent (MBC) and management by exception (MBE). Automation was
provided for two tasks, image prosecution and route re-plans. Time limits for overriding
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 43

automation in the MBE condition were 40 s for image prosecution and 15 s for route re-
plan. Automation reliability was either 75% or 98% for image prosecution, 75% or 100%
for route re-plan.

Overall task involved four sub-tasks
1. Responding to unidentified aircraft
2. Route re-planning
3. Image prosecution
4. Monitoring Mission Mode Indicator (MMI)

Results
An increase in number of UAVs increased completion times for image prosecution, route
re-planning, and MMI monitoring, and also increased the amount of time was spent in
threat zones. Subjects were more likely to respond before MBE automation acted (i.e.,
subjects were more likely to carry out the automation's recommendation than to simply
let the automation carry out the action itself) when there were 2 UAVs than when there
were 4. Subjective workload ratings were higher for 4 UAVs than for 2.

Fewer images were prosecuted and more errors committed when automation was less
reliable. Subjective trust ratings were also lower.

No consistent differences obtained between MBC and MBE . This might be because the
time limit for overriding MBE automation was too long. As noted above, subjects often
pre-empted the automation under MBE by carrying out the recommended action
themselves. Expt 2 therefore reduced time limits for MBE.

Experiment 2
Automation reliability and LOAs were same as in Expt 1, but the time limit for
overriding MBE was now included added as a dependent variable. Time limits for image
prosecution were 15 and 40 seconds. Time limits for route re-plan were 10 and 15
seconds. Execution of route re-plan task was also made more difficult. Only the 4 UAV
condition was used.

Results
Only one measure, the percentage of images correctly prosecuted, showed an effect of
automation reliability.

With MBC, subjective ratings were similar across time limits. With MBE, shorter time
limits produced higher workload ratings and poorer performance on both tasks. Subjects
were faster to complete tasks in MBE/short time limit condition than in any other
combination of automation/time limit, suggesting that they felt time pressure. This may
have contributed to higher subjective workload. MBE automation was more likely to
execute action in short time limit condition.

Haptic feedback as a supplemental method of alerting UAV operators to the onset of
turbulence. Proceedings of the IEA 2000/ HFES 2000 Congress, 3.41 - 3.44.

UAV operators are denied many of the sensory cues available to the pilot of a manned
aircraft. One instance in which this might be consequential is in detecting turbulence.
During flight of a manned aircraft, the onset of turbulence typically produces
kinesthetic/haptic feedback. During UAV flight, turbulence is signaled to the operator
only by perturbations of camera image.

Current experiment measured value of haptic alert (via control stick) for detection of
turbulence onset. Participants flew simulated UAV landings. When turbulence occurred,
subjects rated their level of SA. After each trial, participants rated the difficult of
difficulty, assessed their performance, and judged the strength (mild or severe) and axis
of perturbation (horizontal or vertical) of the turbulence. Note that the multimodal display
did not mimic the haptic signals experienced in real flight, but was simply meant as an
alerting signal.

Results
Haptic feedback improved SA ratings, but if when turbulence occurred when UAV was
far from the runway. When UAV was near runway, no benefit of feedback. Authors
suggest that heightened alertness near runway might facilitate turbulence detection,
mitigating the effects of haptic feedback. RTs for turbulence detection would have
provided useful data to test this hypothesis.

Subjective ratings of landing performance were unaffected by haptic alert, but ratings of
landing difficulty increased when haptic alert was provided. Perceived turbulence
strength and judgments of turbulence direction were unaffected by haptic feedback.

levels of automation and decision-aid fidelity in the supervisory control of multiple
simulated unmanned air vehicles. Presence, 11, 335-351
Subjects flew simulated UAV missions, with task of acquire four targets at unknown
locations (3 enemy and 1 friendly) while avoiding enemy fire. Number of UAVs was 1,
2, or 4. Flight path was preprogrammed. Subjects were required to respond to/manage
events as they occurred through course of scenario. Automation was provided to some
subjects to help manage events. Two forms of automation were used, in addition to the
no-automation baseline: management by consent, and management by exception. Two
levels of automation reliability were used: 100% and 95%.

Results
Management by consent produced the highest level of mission efficiency (number of
enemy targets destroyed divided by number of missiles fired). Management-by-exception
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 45

and manual monitoring produced similar efficiency scores. Decision aid false alarms in
the 95% reliability automation condition were more likely to be detected under
management-by-consent than management-by-exception.

In manual condition, event management became poorer as the number of UAVs
increased. Subjective workload estimated by NASA_TLX also increased with number of
UAVs in the manual and management by consent conditions. SWORD ratings of
workload were higher for manual control than for either form of automation, and were
higher for management-by-consent than for management-by-exception when reliability
was less than perfect. Sword ratings also increased as the number of UAVs increased.

Management-by-consent produced higher levels of self-rated situation awareness than did
manual control or management-by-exception. Management-by-exception produced
especially low ratings of SA when automation reliability was only 95%. SA ratings also
decreased as the number of UAVs increased.

Trust in automation decreased as the number of UAVs increased.

training; students who had recently completed USAF T-1 training; students who recently

Subjects flew basic maneuvers and landings until reaching a criterion level of
performance, then flew 30 reconnaissance missions. Of interest was the number of trials
necessary to reach criterion performance on the training task, and the transfer of training
performance to the reconnaissance task.

Results
Training
As expected, predator pilots required the fewest trials to reach criterion performance, and
nonpilot ROTC students required the most. This comparison demonstrates the validity of
the simulation and task. Predator selectees and civilian instrument pilots required fewer
trials than T-1 grads, required fewer trials. T-38 grads and private pilots were not
significantly worse than Predator selectees/civilian instrument pilots, nor were they
significantly better than T-1 grads. Results demonstrate that prior flight experience can
reduce the number of trials to become proficient at maneuvering & landing the Predator
simulation.

Transfer
Dependent variable was mean amount of time that sensor was focused on target during
each trial. Predator pilots, Predator selectees, and T-38 grads had more time on target
than other groups. ROTC nonpilots had less time on target than Predator pilots, selectees,
T-38 grads, and T-1 grads. Results show that even after subjects achieved matched levels
of performance on the training task, prior flight experience improved performance in the
recon task. Authors suggest that good performance of T-38 grads as compared to T-1
grads may reflect the degree to which performance characteristics of the T-38 and T-1 are
similar to those of the Predator.

uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV). Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 75,
531-538.

An experiment examined pilots' eye movements during a simulated Predator UAV flight
task. Goals were to determine A) how efficiently operators process the moving textbox
instrument displays used in the Predator HUD, B) whether workload (as determined by
windiness during flight and by the difficulty of flight maneuvers) affected scan patterns,
and C) whether the absence of auditory and haptic cues caused UAV pilots to increase
their dwell frequency on the engine instrument (RPM) relative to pilots in a manned
aircraft. Of particular interest was whether or not the moving textbox instruments would
be processed as digital/quantitative displays or as analog/qualitative displays. Past data
has suggested that quantitative displays are processed less efficiently (i.e., require longer
dwell times) than qualitative displays.
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 47

Subjects were 5 instrument rated pilots. Subjects flew an eight-leg flight plan twice, once
in no-wind conditions and once in windy conditions (order randomized). Different
segments of the flight profile included changes in heading, altitude, and airspeed,
sometimes singly and sometimes in combination. Changes involving multiple parameters
were presumed to impose higher workload, as were windy flight conditions.

Results
Dependent variables were dwell times and dwell frequencies. Independent variables were
flight conditions (no wind vs. windy), flight segment (one, two, or three parameters
changed), and instrument. Both dwell times and dwell frequencies showed a significant
main effect of instrument, and neither showed any other main effects or interactions.

Dwell frequency was highest for the ADI, followed by the VSI, AS, HI, ALT, RPM, and
AOA.

To determine whether moving textboxes were processed as qualitative or quantitative
displays, dwell times for these instruments were compared to dwell time for the heading
indicator, an instrument that is clearly quantitative. If moving textboxes are processed as
qualitative displays, they should have dwell times shorter than those for the HI. Only the
AOA and RPM had significantly shorter dwell times, suggesting that other moving
textboxes were processed as quantitative displays.

The author also compares the current data to the results of earlier studies of instrument
scanning in manned aircraft. In the present study, ADI was the most frequently fixated
instrument, but still accounted for only 30% of all dwells. In contrast, previous research
has found that the ADI can account for over 50% of all dwells in manned flight.
Conversely, VSI was fixated more often in the present study (16% of all dwells) than in
studies of manned flight (22%). The author suggests two possible reasons for these
differences. First, ADI in the Predator HUD was very simple, showing only a horizontal
line without any pitch or bank scale. VSI scanning might therefore be necessary to
acquire or verify climb and descent rates. Second, pilots might rely on the VSI more
heavily in UAV given the inherent system delays. In other words, delays in the system
responses to control inputs might require operators to rely more heavily on the predictive
VSI instrument than in manned flight.

Data also suggest that the engine instrument was not scanned more heavily in the current
task than in previous studies of scanning in manned flight. This suggests that operators
did not use the RPM to compensate for the absence of auditory and haptic information,
and may indicate a sub-optimal performance strategy.

The author speculates that the high skill level of the participants in the current experiment
might explain the null effect of workload on scanning behavior.

solution. RTO Meeting Proceedings 44 (RTO-MP-44), B8.1-B8.12.
The author notes that bandwidth constraints on the datalink between a ground control
station and UAV will limit the quality of sensor information displayed to UAV operators.
Two remedies to this problem are possible. The first is to reduce bandwidth needs by
identifying task-critical sensor information and ensuring that only this is transmitted. The
second is to design advanced interfaces that assist the operator in compensating
degradations or limits in sensor imagery.

Several specific ways in which the information provided to a UAV operator is degraded
are described. First, this information typically includes only imagery from an on-board
camera. Input from other sensory modalities (audition, kinesthesia) is lost. Second, the
sensor imagery provided to the operator is often of low resolution, achromatic, and
limited to a small FOV. Third, sensor imagery is often of low temporal resolution.
Fourth, the control devices used to manipulate sensor cameras do not provide
proprioceptive/kinesthetic feedback similar to that obtained in using the scanning through
head and eye movements.

The author next delineates a variety of sensor image characteristics that contribute to
vehicle control: field size, magnification factor, chromaticity, temporal resolution, spatial
resolution, monoscopic vs. stereoscopic presentation, fixed vs. variable viewing direction,
and placement/aiming. To optimize performance, operator can be given the capability to
manually adjust the temporal and spatial display resolution, reduce the image field size,
and toggle between color/grayscale and between stereoscopic/monoscopic display modes.

The UAV operator is also confronted with difficulties in payload sensor control. First,
controls do not provide feedback on camera responses to user inputs. Second, the
operator does not receive vestibular feedback to specify vehicle attitude. Third, the
operator has no proprioceptive feedback to indicate viewing direction. Fourth, control
inputs do not produce immediate changes in sensor imagery. Fifth, spatial information
within the sensor imagery is low in resolution. Sixth, the sensor FOV is often small,
imposing the need for additional control inputs to scan a scene and degrading the
operator's ability to integrate sensor images into a coherent and veridical mental
representation. Seventh, camera imagery may be zoomed-in, disturbing the normal
relationship between camera translation and image motion. Finally, image update rates
may be low, degrading the temporal resolution necessary for dynamic tracking tasks. The
author discusses a number of advanced display designs to address the difficulties in
camera control produced by these degradations. Two of these involve computer-
synthesized imagery superimposed upon or embedding the camera imagery. The value of
such "augmented reality" displays is that they computer-generated components can be
updated immediately in response to user inputs, even if the sensor imagery itself is not
updated until after a delay. The computer-generated components thus can provide real-
time feedback to assist in guiding the sensor footprint. The third novel display discussed
is a radar image that includes actual and predictive sensory footprints. Thus, motion of
the computer-generated predictive sensor footprint again provides operator with
immediate feedback to aid camera targeting, despite delays in camera update rate. Head-

coupled camera control, the author notes, does not improve camera control in a search
task (effect of the head-coupled control is a speed-accuracy tradeoff), and may degrade
performance because of mismatches in proprioceptive and visual information produced
by sensor delays.

Report presents a summary of human factors issues in UAV control, and an overview of
relevant research conducted at TNO.

Human factors concerns
The authors assume that vehicle control will generally be highly automated, and so focus
their discussion of on manual control of payload camera. The studies reported assume
that the most important source of information for camera control will be the imagery
from the on-board camera.

The authors note that the perceptual information the operator receives from the remote
environment is likely to be degraded in several ways:
--no proprioceptive feedback from controls
--no vestibular input based on attitude
--no proprioceptive feedback based on viewing direction
--limited spatial orientation
--no direct feedback (i.e., feedback delayed) in response to control inputs
--no auditory input
--limited resolution of camera images
--limited geometrical field of view
--zoomed-in camera image
--few points of reference at sea
--limited image update rate

Possible consequences for human performance include poor tracking; difficulty in
judging camera, platform, and target motion; confusion about direction of platform flight;
confusion about viewing direction of camera; disorientation; degraded situation
awareness.

Experiments

Experiment 1
Examined the benefits of synthetic visual motion in guiding payload camera. A
computer-generated grid of perpendicular lines was overlaid on camera image, and
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 50

moved in response to camera inputs. In the first experiment, subjects had to track a
moving ship with a simulated UAV sensor camera. Performance was improved by
synthetic image augmentation, and benefits were largest when the update frequency of
the camera was low. In a second experiment, subjects saw a target ship, then had to point
camera at after a 15 s delay that included several translations and rotations of the MUAV.
Again, performance was improved by the synthetic image overlay.

Experiment 2
Asked whether a computer-synthesized world embedding the camera image (called an
ecological display, based on the notion that visual cues provided by embedding world are
directly perceived) can aid in guiding camera. Subjects had to search for target ships with
camera. Performance with ecological display was compared to performance with
heading/pitch indicators adjacent to camera image. Such indicators require cognitive
inference, in contrast to ecological display. Ecological display reduced search time and
total number of camera motions. Indicators did not significantly improve performance
relative to baseline.

Experiment 3
Asked whether an ecological display can allow an operator to control UAV airframe and
camera simultaneously. The task required the subject to track a target ship while circling
it. Four display types were used: two without augmentation (north up & track up), and
two with augmentation (2D synthetic world and a 3D synthetic world). Data showed that
augmented displays aided airframe control without degrading tracking. Augmented
displays also allowed effective manual control with high airframe speeds.

Experiment 4
Experiment examined manual control of sensor under conditions of low update rates and
delayed visual feedback, and measured the benefits of a predictive camera footprint. Data
showed that update rates below 2 Hz and delays longer than 2 seconds degraded tracking
performance. Predictor display eliminated costs of slow update rate and time delay except
at the most extreme values.

Experiment 5
Examined the effects of head-slaved camera control, time delays, and advanced interface
design on situational awareness. The authors speculate that proprioceptive feedback from
head-slaved control may aid SA. However, helmet-mounted displays might be
uncomfortable, and transmission delays could make the perception of spatial information
difficult. In the experiment, HMD was compared to head-slaved dome projection. To
overcome the problems of delayed image transmission, a method of compensation called
delay handling was introduced. Delay handling preserves spatial relationships between
input images by presenting them in the viewing direction of the camera at the moment
image was recorded, rather than the moment at which image transmission is received.
Data indicate that delay handling improves SA. No benefit was found for dome
projection relative to helmet-mounted display.

Experiment 6
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 51

Compared head-coupled control/helmet-mounted displays to manual control of camera.
Subjects had to locate five target ships as quickly as possible. In manual control
condition, imagery was projected on a dome, so that proprioceptive info was available in
both conditions. Head-slaved camera control increased search speed but enlarged the
search path as compared to manual control.

operators of unmanned aerial vehicles. RTO Meeting Proceedings (RTO-MO-088).

UAVs flight path is often pre-programmed, but camera must still be steered manually.
This can be difficult because of low camera update rates and communication time delays
between GCS and vehicle. One method of addressing these difficulties is to provide
current and predictive camera view footprints on a 2D map. This provides motion
feedback when camera moves, along with information preview of where the camera will
be shifting. The authors note that a 2D map provides primarily exocentric (authors use
the term "local") spatial information, while a 3D map provides egocentric ("global") info.
Authors speculate that providing a predictive camera footprint within a 3D map might
therefore improve camera steering performance beyond that observed with a 2D map.
The goal of the experiment was to test this speculation.

Subjects flew a simulated UAV recon mission which required them to search for military
vehicles along roads and edges of woods. Two side-by-side displays were used. On the
left was a 2D map which presented waypoints and route plan; flight direction; and actual
and predicted camera footprints. On the right (in some conditions) was a 3D map which
presented an immersed view from vantage point of UAV camera, along with actual and
predicted footprints. In experimental conditions, subjects were provided the 3D display in
addition to the 2D map. In control conditions, only the 2D map was provided. The
camera image was presented in lower right display. Camera image quality had three
levels: normal, 3 Hz update rate, 1 second delay. In some conditions, subjects also
performed a secondary monitoring/memory task.

Results
When camera quality was normal, 3D camera produced a small increase in the percentage
of roads and wood edges that were inspected (~35% vs. ~40%). When camera image
quality was degraded, the benefits of the 3D map were larger (~20% vs. ~30%).
Secondary task performance was better with 3D map, suggesting that map produced
spare mental capacity, and subjective workload ratings were lower with 3D camera than
without. EOGs indicated that subjects inspected 3D map frequently, especially when
camera quality was low.

models to analyze the effects of crew size and crew fatigue on the control of tactical
unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAVs) (ARL-CR-0483). Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD:
Army Research Laboratory.

A study used simulation modeling to determine how fatigue, crew size, and rotation
schedule affect operator workload and performance on a TUAV control task. Simulations
were conducted using MicroSaint modeling architecture, from Micro Analysis and
Design. 18 subject matter experts (SMEs) provided A) a list of tasks that are involved in
controlling a TUAV during normal operations and during emergencies, B) the order in
which the tasks are performed, C) the visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor
workload imposed by tasks, D) the types of emergencies that can occur during missions,
and E) the probabilities of mishaps occurring during emergencies when soldiers are
fatigued.

The fatigue algorithm used by simulation predicts human response capability for tasks
over an extended period of sleep deprivation. The focus of algorithm is the interaction of
sleep deprivation with circadian rhythms.

The model used simulates the tactical operations center (TOC) and launch/recover station
(LRS) (including mission commander [MC], aerial vehicle operator [AVO], and mission
payload operator [MPO] duties), and several functions: launch, transfer, recovery,
mission support, emplacement, displacement, emergencies, mishaps, and maintenance
during emplacement. The model was used to simulate 12- and 18-hr missions over a 24-
hr period under 15 different conditions for three consecutive days. During the missions,
there were times with 2 UAVs in-flight: one observing the targets, and one flying to
assume control of search. Soldiers were modeled to work 2-, 3-, 4-, or 6-hr rotation
schedules. The model does not simulate soldier activity in between shifts.

Models simulate one move (jump) per day for the TOC and one move every other day for
the LRS. Each move comprises a 1/2 break-down, 1/2-hr move, and a 1-hr setup. The
TUAV spends 5 hrs of simulation time in the air: 4 hrs of surveillance and 1 hr in transit
to/from destination. The output of model includes performance times, target detection
rates, and AV mishaps under each simulated condition. Several crew configurations
(different numbers of MCs and AVOs/MPOs) were tested.

Some conditions that can affect a TUAV mission include
--type of search: area search, person search, airfield, tanks, building, road search, bridge,
missile site, command post, air defense artillery, check points, battle damage assessment
on SAM, artillery search
--emergencies: icing, generator failure, signal degradation or intermittent link loss,
payload failure, AVO or MPO console failure, GPS failure
--weather: humidity, sun, gusting winds, crosswinds, flat clouds, ragged clouds
--terrain: high vegetation, desert (sand), high desert, city, town, village

Workload estimates were obtained from SMEs using a scale developed to be compatible
with Wickens' (1984) multiple resources theory of attention. Four resource pools were
assumed: visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor.

The model simulates 5 TUAV launches per day for an 18-hr mission. Each launch, three
types of target search were performed. Missions were repeated every day for 3 days for
each crew rotation schedule.

Results
Decreasing crew size decreased target hit rates and increased target detection times.

Workload estimates suggested that when there was no MC in the LRS, the TOC MC was
interrupted ~50% of the time to perform tasks that the LRS MC would otherwise have
performed. When there was 1 MC in the LRS, the TOC MC was interrupted ~20% of the
time with LRS MC tasks. Adding a third AVO to the LRS (compared to baseline
condition of 2 AVOs) did not improve performance.

The model was adjusted to simulate 12-hr mission profiles with and without 1-hr gaps
between flights. Three launches were simulated per day instead of 5. Results were similar
to those from 18-hr mission conditions. No performance differences were produced by 1-
hr gaps between missions.

Examined the benefits of offloading tasks from visual channel in a single-UAV control
task, and compared the results to the predictions of single-channel theory (SCT), single-
resource theory (SRT), and multiple-resource theory (MRT) of attention. Subjects each
flew a series of missions involving three tasks: mission completion (flight path tracking),
inspecting command targets (CTs) / searching for targets of opportunity (TOOs), and
monitoring system gauges for system failures (SFs) (i.e., out of bounds values). Flight
instructions (fly-to coordinates of next target and a question about the target to be
answered) were provided during the task. Instructions could be refreshed with a button
press. In baseline condition, pilots flew with all manual flight controls and all visual
displays. In auditory condition, SF alerts and flight instructions were provided aurally. In
an automation condition, flight control was offloaded to an automated system. All
alerts/instructions/automation were perfectly reliable.

Results
Flight path tracking was unaffected by auditory offloading.

Button-press refreshes of instructions were reduced in both the auditory offloading and
the automation conditions. In auditory condition, this might have been because aural
presentation reduced visual conflict during time that instructions were first presented. In
automation condition, it may have been because the subject was not required to
remember target coordinates.

TOO detection rates improved under autopilot flight control both for single and dual-
UAV tasks. This was in part due to the fact that the autopilot flew directly over each
target, while the human operator sometimes did not. However, an autopilot benefit was
evident even restricting analysis to those trials on which the TOO appeared in the 3D
display. This suggests a role for the autopilot in improving cognitive/attentional
performance in TOO detection.

Auditory alerts significantly improved SF detection rates and SF response times
compared to baseline, except in cases where the subject was loitering/inspecting a target
at time of SF occurrence. This suggests that difficult image interpretation produced
cognitive tunneling. Automation condition also improved SF detection rates (though not
under all circumstances), but did not affect SF response times.

predict performance in a multiple-task UAV environment-2 UAVs (Technical report
AHFD-03-09/MAAD-03-1). Savoy, IL: University of Illinois, Institute of Aviation,
Aviation Human Factors Division.

Examined the benefits of task offloading to pilots performing single- and multiple-UAV
tasks and compared the results to predictions of single-channel attention theory (SCT),
single-resource theory (SRT), and multiple-resource theory (MRT) of attention. Subjects
each flew a series of missions involving three tasks: mission completion (flight path
tracking), inspecting command targets (CTs) / searching for targets of opportunity
(TOOs), and monitoring system gauges for system failures (SFs). Flight instructions (fly-
to coordinates of next target & a question about the target to be answered) were provided
during the task. Instructions could be refreshed with a button press. In the baseline
condition, pilots flew with all manual flight controls and all visual displays. In the
auditory condition, SF alerts and flight instructions were provided aurally. In the
automation condition, flight control was offloaded to an automated system. All
alerts/instructions/automation were perfectly reliable.

Results
Flight path tracking was unaffected by auditory offloading. Button-press refreshes of
flight instructions were reduced in both the auditory offloading and the automation
conditions, suggesting that these conditions freed up processing resources. The number of
refreshes was higher in dual-UAV conditions, but the effect was primarily in the baseline
& auditory offloading conditions, not in the automation condition. TOO detection rates
improved under autopilot flight control both for single and dual-UAV tasks. This was in
part due to the fact that the autopilot flew directly over each target, while the human
operator sometimes did not. However, an autopilot benefit was evident even restricting
analysis to those trials on which the TOO appeared in the 3D display. This suggests a role
for autopilot in improving cognitive/attentional performance in TOO detection.

Auditory alerts improved SF detection rates and reduced detection times. Autopilot had
no effect. Dual-UAV costs to SF detection time obtained in the baseline and autopilot
conditions, but not in the auditory alert condition. SF detection times were longer for
faults that occurred during target inspection than for faults that occurred under normal
flight, lending some support to CST and SRT. However, this effect was mitigated
somewhat by auditory alerts, consistent with MRT.

51) Williams, K.W. (2004). A summary of unmanned aircraft accident/incident
data: Human factors implications.

Examines military UAV accident/incident data for various UAV systems.

Army
Hunter
Hunter takes off & lands using an external pilot (EP) in visual contact using controller
similar to that used for remote controlled hobby planes. After takeoff and climb, internal
pilot (IP) assumes controls from GCS. The IP controls the aircraft using knobs to select
altitude, heading, & airspeed. 47% of accidents were HF related. The largest percentage
(47%) of HF issues arose during landing. An additional 20% arise during takeoff. Control
difficulties are caused in part by the need for the operator to reverse control inputs when
aircraft is headed toward him/her. Other problems include:
--pilot-in-command issues
--failure of alerts/alarms to inform operator of non-normal conditions
--mode display errors
--crew failure to follow proper procedure

Shadow
The Shadow uses a launcher for takeoff and an automated system, the tactical automated
landing system (TALS), for recovery. Landing generally does not require intervention
from the operator in the GCS. In flight, the aircraft is controlled through a menu-based
interface that allows operator to select altitude, heading, & airspeed. During landing,
operator in GCS has no visual contact with aircraft, and receives no data from onboard
sensors. An external observer is required to communicate to the operator when the craft
has touched down, at which time the operator gives a command to stop the engine. HF
errors were less frequent with Shadow than with Hunter.

Navy
Pioneer
The Pioneer requires an EP for takeoff & landing. After takeoff, IP controls the vehicle
from the GCS in one of three modes: autonomously using preprogrammed waypoint
coordinates; semi-autonomously using airspeed, altitude and heading values specified
with rotary knobs; manually, with a joystick. There are plans to implement an automated
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 57

system for ship-based landings. 28% of accidents were HF related. Of these, 68%
occurred during landing and 10% during takeoff. An additional 13% were due to aircrew
coordination lapses (procedural & communication errors) and 10% were weather related
errors resulting from errors in pilot decision making.

Fire Scout
A vertical takeoff & landing vehicle, the Fire Scout was involved in one accident.
Antenna was damaged during ground handling (human error), causing incorrect altimeter
reading when vehicle was airborne.

Air Force
Predator
The Predator is flown from a GCS using a joystick and rudder pedals and a forward
looking camera with a 30-deg FOV. The camera is also used for takeoffs and landings.
Human factors lapses contributed to 67% of accidents. A majority of these (75%) were
procedural errors, including a failure to follow checklist steps during handoff between
crews and an accidental activation of a program that erased the aircraft computer's
internal RAM.

Interface issues are discussed in 89% of Predator accidents, and are cited as a
contributing factor in 44%. Four categories of interface issues: design of HUD; design of
HDD; alerts and alarms; functioning of the autopilot.
--HUD problems: FOV (30 degs) is too narrow; attitude indicator is inadequate; RPM
indicator needs improvement; symbology obscured during low-link conditions;
symbology contrast too low; symbology inadequate.
--HDD problems: too many levels to maneuver through to reach needed info; info display
unintuitive; critical commands unprotected or unemphasized; operational value ranges
inconsistent within display.
--Alerts/alarms problems: do not capture attention; audio warnings insufficient or absent;
info provided inadequate or poorly prioritized; info provided invalid; data that need to be
compared not always collocated on same display page.
--Autopilot problems: no indication of autopilot status on HUD; flight controls are
disabled while autopilot is engaged (i.e., no override capability) and four separate menus
have to be traversed in order to deactivate autopilot (requires about M = 7 seconds);
autopilot tends to command extreme measures and overstress aircraft; autopilot
functionality does not conform to AF standards.

Global Hawk
Global Hawk is the most fully automated of UAV systems. All phases of flight are
automated, including takeoff & landing. The crew's task is to monitor the aircraft and
control payload. This makes flying the relatively easy, but makes mission planning
exceedingly difficult. Mission planning process begins up to 270 days prior to mission.
Once the target set is finalized, 3-5 weeks are required to write and validate mission plan.
Of three accident reports available for Global Hawk, only one involved HF issues.
Aircraft was forced to perform an emergency landing at a preprogrammed alternate
airport. At point of airport, a taxi speed of 155 knots had been set due to software bug
                                                                          Human Factors of UAVs 58

during preprogramming. When aircraft was commanded to begin taxiing for takeoff, it
reached a speed where it was unable to turn at appropriate point and ran off the runway.
Fundamental HF problem with the Global Hawk is that the system does not encourage
close monitoring by operators, resulting in reduced SA. An additional problem is that
status reports are provided in hexadecimal and do not include trend data.

52) Wilson, G.F., & Russell, C.A. (2004). Psychophysiologically determined
adaptive aiding in a simulated UCAV task. Proceedings of the Second Human
Performance, Situation Awareness, and Automation Conference (HPSAA II), Daytona
Beach, FL, March 22-25.

An experiment tested the benefits of adaptive aiding based on psychophysiological
assessment of operator workload. The task required subjects to monitor 4 vehicles flying
preplanned routes. When vehicles reached designated points, radar images of target area
were presented to subject. Subject searched target area then selected targets for bombing.
The search/target designation task was conducted under time stress. The subjects chose
the order in which images from the vehicles were presented. Images were presented at
two levels of difficulty. The more difficult level included more distractors and required
more difficult decisions regarding target priority.

Subjects were also required to monitor vehicles for potential emergencies (e.g., loss of
communication). Memory load was manipulated by having subject hold up to 4
aircraft/problem combinations simultaneously until a command was given specifying
which problem to address.

EEG, ECG, and EOG data were recorded. An artificial neural network was trained to
recognize periods of low and high task difficulty using these data. During criterion task
performance, three levels of adaptive aiding were used: 1) no aiding, 2) aiding during
times of high workload, and 3) random aiding. Aiding involved decreasing velocity of
vehicle so that time stress was reduced. Subjective workload was measured with NASA-
TLX.

Results
The neural net was 70% accurate at classifying high/low task difficulty levels during task
performance. For all conditions, the number of correctly selected targets was lower when
the task was difficult. The number of designated points of impact was lower for the
difficult task level in the unaided and the randomly-aided conditions, but was unaffected
by task difficulty in the adaptively-aided condition. Similarly, the number of missed
weapons releases was higher in the difficult level for the unaided and randomly-aided
conditions but was unaffected by difficulty in the adaptively aided condition. Differences
in subjective workload were marginal and inconsistent.
