                                                           Exemption No. 11839
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1151

Mr. Nathan J. Meyer

Summerland Key, FL 33042

Dear Mr. Meyer:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. You requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
videography and cinematography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
                                                                                                                 2

aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Nathan J. Meyer is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Nathan J. Meyer is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    Vision Plus when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

Washington, DC 20590

Re: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act of the Federal Aviation Regulations from 14 C.F.R.

45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. Part 21; 91.7(a); 91.9(b) (2); 91.103(b); 91.109; 119.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a)&(b); 91.405(a);
91.407(a) (1); 91.409(a) (2); 91.417(a)&(b)

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Nathan J. Meyer, am writing pursuant to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and
the procedures contained within 14 C.F.R. 11, to request that I, Nathan J. Meyer, an owner and
operator of small unmanned aircraft, be exempted from the Federal Aviation Regulations
("FARs") listed below so that I, Nathan J. Meyer, may operate my small ultra lightweight
unmanned aircraft system ("UAS") commercially in airspace regulated by the Federal Aviation
Administration ("FAA").

As described herein I, Nathan J. Meyer, am an FAA licensed commercial pilot with instrument,
CFI and CFII designations and I hold a current second class medical, with over 1000 hours
logged1. I am also a licensed Realtor within the State of Florida. I am experienced in flying
hobby helicopters for recreational purposes.Icurrently fly a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, hobby
grade quad-copter UAS equipped with wide angle camera. I am seeking exemption to use this
aircraft in aerial videography/cinematography to enhance academic community awareness for
those individuals and companies unfamiliar with the geographical layout of The Florida Keys,
and to augment real estate listing videos and photos.

I have flown small RC electric quadcopters for over four (4) years without incident or accident,
and have logged 32 hours with my current UAS1. Committed to safety with each flight, my,
Nathan J. Meyer's, exemption request would permit operation of ultra lightweight, unmanned
(piloted by remote control) and comparatively inexpensive UAS(s) in class G airspace in The
Florida Keys2All operations would be conducted in predetermined areas away from the general
public, airports, heliports and vehicular traffic, and within property boundaries and/or adjacent,
unpopulated waterways and vacant land for individual homeowner real estate listing
videos/photos. Currently, similar lightweight, remote controlled UAS's are legally operated by
unmonitored amateur hobbyists with no safety plan or controls in place to prevent incident or
accident. I, Nathan J. Meyer, have personally established safety protocols and controls3to avoid
and prevent public hazard. This will act to further safety protocols exclusive to lightweight
UAS's specific to real estate video and photography usage as I, Nathan J. Meyer, log flight data
and other information gained through permitted flight operations to share with the FAA
through any required or requested FAA reports to assist with future protocol and safety

      1. Appendix A
      2. Appendix B
      3. Appendix C
regulation. I believe my experience as a commercial pilot and CFI, combined with my
experience as a UAS pilot will bring a unique and valuable perspective to this emerging
technology, and any and all data and observations will be openly shared with the FAA.

Granting my, Nathan J. Meyer's, request comports with the Secretary of Transportation's (FAA
Administrator's) responsibilities and authority to not only integrate UAS's into the national
airspace system, but to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems [UAS's] in the national airspace system" under Section 333(c) of the Reform Act specific
to the use of UAS's for real estate/Realtor purposes. Further I, Nathan J. Meyer, will conduct my
operations in compliance with the protocols described herein or as otherwise established by
the FAA. For the reasons stated below I, Nathan J. Meyer, respectfully request the grant of an
exemption allowing me to operate ultra lightweight, remote controlled UAS's for academic
community awareness to benefit/stimulate attraction to the Florida Keys Area, and to enhance
real estate listing videos and photos for homeowners who cannot afford expensive manned
aircraft for the same purpose. Both of which will promote local economic growth through
increased employment and increased tax base. Both will improve public safety by replacing
heavier, manned aircraft containing combustible fuel that that poses potential public hazard
with extremely lightweight, maneuverable, unmanned aircraft that poses extremely minimal
risk. Furthermore, the reduced noise and fuel emissions of using a lightweight UAS as
compared with manned aircraft photographic/videographic shoots will greatly benefit the
public and environment.

II.The Specific Sections of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations From Which Nathan J.
Meyer Requests Exemption are:

14 CFR 21;
14 C.F.R. 45.23(b);
14 C.F.R. 91, et seq.;
14 CFR 407 (a) (1);
14 CFR 409 (a) (2); and,
14 CFR 417 (a) & (b).

III. The Extent of relief Nathan J. Meyer seeks and the Reason He Seeks Such Relief:

I, Nathan J. Meyer, submit this application in accordance with the Reform Act, 112 P.L. 95 §§
331-334, seeking relief from any currently applicable FARs operating to prevent me, Nathan J.
Meyer, contemplated commercial photographic, cinematic, academic and other flight
operations within the national airspace system. The Reform Act in Section 332 provides for such
integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into our national airspace system as it is in the
public's interest to do so.

My, Nathan J. Meyer's, ultra lightweight UAS meets the definition of "small unmanned aircraft"
as defined in Section 331 and therefore the integration of my ultra light weight UAS is expressly
contemplated by the Reform Act. I would like to operate my ultra lightweight UAS prior to the
time period by which the Reform Act requires the FAA to promulgate rules governing such
craft. Thereby, providing direct experience and valuable information for formal regulation that
can be administered uniformly to all real estate related UAS aerial video and photography. The
Reform Act guides the Secretary in determining the types of UAS's that may operate safely in
our national airspace system. Considerations include: The weight, size, speed and overall
capabilities of the UAS's; Whether the UAS will be operated near airports or heavily populated
areas; and, Whether the UAS will be operated by line of sight. 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (a). Each of
these items reflect in favor of an exemption for me, Nathan J. Meyer. My UAS utilizes four (4)
counter-rotating propellers for balance, control and stability. My UAS is equipped with GPS and
auto return safety technology, geo-fencing technology, and battery monitoring technology with
a fail-safe to automatically return to landing point if battery is running under 10%. Weighing
less than five (5) pounds (far below the maximum 55 pound limit); including camera with
gimbal, this aircraft is extremely lightweight.

I, Nathan J. Meyer, consider safety foremost with each flight. My small unmanned aircraft is
designed to hover in place via GPS and operate in less than a 24 knot (15 mph) wind. I also use
geo-fencing, to limit the altitude and perimeter of flight. For safety, stability and fear of
financial loss I will not fly in winds exceeding 16 kph (10 mph). Built in safety systems include a
GPS mode that allows my UAS to hover in place when radio controls are released. When pilot
communication is lost this UAS is designed slowly descend to point of take off. I do not operate
my UAS near airports, Hospitals nor Police heliports, and do not operate near areas where
general public is within fifty to one hundred (50-100) yards depending on location, conditions
and weather. I operate only in class G airspace. I use a visual observer to aid in ensuring the
area is clear of people and vehicles. I am constantly on alert for any manned aircraft
(Police/Medical helicopters, etc.) and I am prepared to land/abort immediately to the nearest
and safest ground point should a manned aircraft approach my location or I suspect manned
aircraft may approach near my location. I monitor local ATC frequencies on a handheld aviation
radio. My UAS is capable of vertical and horizontal operations, and is flown only within my line
of sight of me, as the remote control pilot. Utilizing battery power rather than combustible
fuels, flights generally last between seven (8) to ten (10) minutes, with an altitude under one
hundred fifty (150) feet. I, Nathan J. Meyer, utilize a fresh fully charged battery with each flight
as a safety precaution; full flight time limit for each battery is twenty (20) to twenty five (25)
minutes as tested. My controller and link with my UAS provides battery level information, and
also has an automatic return to home feature at 20% battery power in the event the PIC fails to
monitor reserves, along with visual and auditory alerts at 20%. I do not operate my UAS at or
below manufacturer recommend minimum charge levels for operation; preferring to remain
well within a safe operating range to insure adequate communication between radio control
and UAS to eliminate potential for crash, loss of control or hazard. My personal protocol is to
land with 50% reserves. Additional batteries are at hand with each exercise to insure
replacement for sufficient safe level of operation. I have roughly 3 years of experience
operating UAS aircraft, and I have logged 32 hours, as a UAS multi-rotor rotorcraft pilot
including 32 Hours of logged flight time with the DJI Phantom Vision 2 Plus5. I also have over
100 hours of unlogged time as a hobbyist simulating flights for future commercial use to gain
familiarization with the characteristics of this specific UAS's performance under different
temperature and weather conditions. I am a licensed pilot with commercial instrument, CFI
and CFII ratings. I have logged over 1300 hours as PIC in a variety of single engine, fixed wing,
manned aircraft5,both commercially and privately without accident or incident. My pilot
training and experience have been instrumental in allowing me to operate my UAS safely, and
in helping me protect the safety of other pilots and civilians.

My, Nate Meyer's, exemption request would allow operation in predetermined areas
designated as class G airspace, clear of persons, airports, heliports and vehicular traffic for
community videos and photos. Real estate photography/videography would be within property
boundaries of individual homeowner, and/or over adjacent waterways or vacant land, when
deemed clear of any and all persons, vehicles or marine traffic.A visual observer would be
present for all flights to ensure the area remains clear, or to alert me, the PIC, to abort the flight
of a potential breach of the flight area. A 2 way aviation radio would be monitored at all times.
A NOTAM would be issued prior to any operations. A thorough review of weather conditions,
aircraft airworthiness, emergency procedures and potential hazards would be reviewed prior
to any flight operation. Geofencing would be used to ensure all flights are conducted within
the established, cleared perimeter.

I, Nathan J. Meyer, am extremely cautious when operating of my UAS/ultra lightweight
unmanned aircraft and will not "create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the
public." 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (b). Given the small size and weight of my UAS it falls well within
Congress's contemplated safety zone when it promulgated the Reform Act and the
corresponding directive to integrate UAS's into the national airspace system. Nathan J. Meyer's
UAS, used in hobby flight, has a demonstrable safety record and does not pose any threat to
the general public or national security.

IV. How Nathan J. Meyer's Request Will Benefit the Public As A Whole:

I have acted as PIC of small planes for the purpose of shooting aerial photos and videos, and
feel UAS flight provides a much safer alternative for both the pilot and the public. Further, for
small, budget real estate companies and average homeowners the expense of manned aerial
videography is cost prohibitive. Only large companies and high end Realtors or luxury
homeowners can afford to absorb such expense, depriving non-luxury homeowners and lower
budget Realtors from a valuable marketing tool. My, Nathan J. Meyer's, UAS poses minimal
threat, since size and lack of combustible fuel mitigates potential risk to the public. Congress
has already proclaimed that it is in the public's interest to integrate commercially flown UAS's
into the national airspace system, hence the passing of the Reform Act. Granting my, Nathan J.
Meyer's, exemption request furthers the public interest through academic/visual awareness of
the geographical benefits in and around the Florida Keys Area. My ultra lightweight UAS is
battery powered and creates no emissions that can harm the environment. The consequence of
my ultra light weight UAS crashing is far less than a full size helicopter or fixed wing aircraft;
which are heavy, contain combustible fuel and can cause catastrophic devastation to the public.

The public's interest is furthered by minimizing ecological and crash threat by permitting aerial
video/photo capture through my battery operated ultra lightweight UAS's. Permitting me,
Nathan J. Meyer, to immediately fly within national air space furthers economic growth.
Granting my exemption request substantially furthers the economic impact for the Florida Keys
community for companies and individuals looking to relocate or build in the Florida Keys area as
well as individuals looking to relocate for career advancement through academic and
geographical awareness. Both of which serve as a stimulus to the community.

Finally, replacing manned aircraft photographic and video shoots with UAS shoots will
dramatically reduce emissions and aircraft noise, reducing/eliminating impact on the
environment and reducing annoyance to the public.

V. Reasons Why Exemption Will Not Adversely Affect Safety Or How The Exemption Will
Provide a Level of Safety At Least Equal To Existing Rule:

My, Nathan J. Meyer's, exemption will not adversely affect safety. Quite the contrary, for the
reasons stated permitting me, Nathan J. Meyer, to log more flight time, with communication
with the FAA, will allow me to contribute to further safety protocols for Realtors that can be
embraced by the NAR (National Association of Realtors) for development in cooperation with the FAA. In
addition I, Nathan J. Meyer, submit the following representations of enhancements to current
aerial videography and photography for real estate:

     My UAS weighs less than 5 pounds complete with camera; I only operate my UAS below
         150 feet AGL (well within the 400 foot permissible ceiling set by the FAA Modernization
         and Reform Act of 2012).

     I set a geofence that prevents my UAS from going outside of my established clear area
         should there be a lost connection with the controller.

     I only operate my UAS for 7-10 minutes per flight; I land my UAS prior to manufacturer
         recommended minimum level of battery power, with at least 50% reserves.

     My experience as a pilot and flight instructor carry over into my UAV flying and lead to a
         high level of safety consciousness, preparation and preflight prudence, and experienced
         aeronautical decision making. I also have a thorough understanding of the FAR's, and
         the airspace system.

     I carry a two way Icom Aviation Radio and monitor local ATC frequencies when
         conducting UAV flights.
     I pilot my UAS through remote control only by line of sight;
     My UAS has GPS and a flight safety feature whereby it hovers and then slowly lands if

         communication with the remote control pilot is lost;
     I actively analyze flight data and other sources of information to constantly update and

         enhance safety protocols;
     I only operate in reasonably safe environments that are strictly controlled, are away

         from power lines, elevated lights, airports and actively populated areas;
     I conduct extensive preflight inspections and protocol, during which safety carries

         primary importance;
     I always obtains all necessary permissions prior to operation; and,
     I have procedures in place to abort flights in the event of safety breaches or potential

         danger.
     I use a visual observer to insure established flight area remains clear.
     I use geofencing to insure flight stays within an established altitude and perimeter.
     I will operate only in vfr conditions, adhering to FAA prescribed cloud clearance rules.
     The UAS will not be flown at a speed exceeding 15 knots.
     The UAS will be flown only during daytime hours, as defined by the FAA.
     See Appendix E for complete operating procedures.

My, Nathan J. Meyer's, safety protocols provide a level of safety equal to or exceeding existing
rules. It is important to note that absent the integration of commercial UAS into our national
airspace system, helicopters and fixed wing manned aircraft are the primary means of aerial
video and photography for community awareness and real estate. While the safety record of
such manned aircraft is questionable, often requiring low level maneuvering; it is far safer to
operate a battery powered ultra lightweight UAS.

First, the potential loss of life is diminished because UAS's carry no people on board and I only
operates my UAS in specific areas away from mass populations. Second, there is no fuel on
board a UAS and thus the potential for fire or explosions is greatly diminished. Third, the small
size and extreme maneuverability of my UAS allow me to remotely pilot away from and avoid
hazards quickly and safely. Lastly, given its small size and weight, even when close enough to
capture amazing images, my UAS need not be so close to the objects they are focused on
through the technology and use of post editing software allowing pan and zoom.

Accordingly, my UAS has been experimentally operated for familiarization/competency and will
continue to operate at and above current safety levels.

VI. A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:

A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like. 14 C.F.R. 21,
Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for procurement of
necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1). The size, weight and
enclosed operational area of my, Nathan J. Meyer's, UAS permits exemption from Part 21
because my UAS meets (and exceeds) an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of
the Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate
requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both
pieces of legislation permit the FAA to exempt UAS's from the airworthiness certificate
requirement in consideration of the weight, size, speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas
such as airports and dense populations. My, Nathan J. Meyer's, current and projected UAS's
meet or exceed each of the elements.

14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. As
no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the FARs, this Regulation is
inapplicable. 14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there
are no on board pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is
inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a safety/flight
manual delineating areas of where safety can be defined.1 The FAA has previously issued
exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B,
10167, 10167A, 10602, 10700 and 32827. 14 C.F.R. § 91.121 regarding altimeter settings is
inapplicable insofar as my UAS utilizes electronic global positioning systems with a barometric sensor.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b) provides for the carrying of civil aircraft certifications and registrations.
They are inapplicable for the same reasons described above. The equivalent level of safety will be
achieved by maintaining any such required certifications and registrations by me, Nathan J. Meyer.

B. 14 C.F.R. § 45.23: Marking of The Aircraft. Applicable Codes of Federal Regulation require aircraft to
be marked according to certain specifications. My UAS are, by definition, unmanned. They therefore
do not have a cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or phrases. Further,
two-inch lettering is difficult to place on such small aircraft with dimensions smaller that minimal
lettering requirement. Regardless, I will mark my UAS in the largest possible lettering by placing the
word "EXPERIMENTAL" on its fuselage as required by 14 C.F.R. §45.29 (f) so that I the pilot, or anyone
assisting me as a visual observer with the UAV will see the markings. The FAA has previously issued
exemptions to this regulation through Exemptions Nos. 8738, 10167, 10167A and 10700.

C. 14 C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes. 14 C.F.R. § 91.119 prescribes safe altitudes for the
operation of civil aircraft. It allows helicopters to be operated at lower altitudes in certain conditions.
My UAS will never operate at an altitude greater than 200 AGL; safely below the standard of 400 AGL.
I, Nathan J. Meyer, will however operate my UAS in safe areas away from public and traffic, providing
a level of safety at least equivalent to or below those in relation to minimum safe altitudes. Given the
size, weight, maneuverability and speed of my UAS, an equivalent or higher level of safety will be
achieved.

E. 14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections. The above-cited
Regulations require, amongst other things, aircraft owners and operators to "have [the] aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this
chapter. . . ." These Regulations only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. They will not,

1 Appendix E - Safety/Flight Manual
therefore, apply to my, Nathan J. Meyer's, UAS. However, as a safety precaution I inspect my UAS
before and after each flight.

A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register: A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91:
Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like. 14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled
Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for procurement of necessary airworthiness
certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1). The size, weight and enclosed operational area of
my UAS permits exemption from Part 21 because my, Nathan J. Meyer's, UAS meets an
equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to
exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. §
44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces of legislation permit the FAA to
exempt UAS's from the airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the weight,
size, speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense populations. My
UAS meets or exceeds each of the elements. 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an
aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form
contemplated by the FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable. 14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an
aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no pilots or passengers, and given the size of
the UAS's, this Regulation is inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by
maintaining a manual. The FAA has previously issued exemptions to this regulation in
Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, maintenance program
that involves regular software updates and curative measures for any damaged hardware.
Therefore, an equivalent level of safety will be achieved.

In summary, Nathan J. Meyer seeks an exemption from the following
Regulations:

14 C.F.R. 21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.7 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b)(2); 14 C.F.R. §
91.103(b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.109; 14 C.F.R. § 91.119; 14 C.F.R. § 91.121; 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a); 14
C.F.R. §§ 91.203(a) and (b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.405 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.407 (a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409
(a)(2); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409 (a ) (2); and, 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.417 (a) & (b) to commercially operate my,
Nathan J. Meyer's, small unmanned vehicle/lightweight unmanned aircraft vehicle in
community awareness and real estate operations, and to develop economic platforms for real
estate to enhance the experience of those seeking to relocate to the Florida Keys area.
Currently, area awareness and real estate aerial videography/photography relies primarily on
the use of larger aircraft running on combustible fuel. Posing potential risk to the public.
Granting my, Nathan J. Meyer's, request for exemption will reduce current risk levels and
thereby enhance safety. My UAS craft do not contain potentially explosive fuel, is smaller,
lighter and more maneuverable than conventional real estate video and photographic aircraft
with much less flight time. Further, I operate at lower altitudes and in Class G airspace
eliminating potential public risk flying to and from established airfields. I, Nathan J. Meyer, have
been informally analyzing flight information and will compile safety protocols and the
implementation of a flight operations manual for real estate usage that exceeds currently
accepted means and methods for safe flight. My experience as both a Commercially licensed
Flight Instructor and long-time UAS pilot will provide Formal collection of information shared
with the FAA will enhance the FAA's internal efforts to establish protocols for complying with
the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. There are no personnel on board my, Nathan J.
Meyer's, UAS and therefore the likelihood of death or serious bodily injury is significantly
diminished. My, Nathan J. Meyer's, operation of my UAS, weighing less than 5 pounds and
travelling at lower speeds within limited areas will provide an equivalent level of safety as that
achieved under current FARs. Accordingly I, Nathan J. Meyer, respectfully request that the FAA
grant my exemption request and am willing to cooperate in sharing information to benefit the
FAA for the safety of manned aircraft, and the general public at large.

Respectfully submitted,
