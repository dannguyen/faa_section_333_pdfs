                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0895

Dear Mr. Ratcliff:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated June 16, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Crosstimbers Video Partners LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from ㎣ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add the DJI Phantom 3 and DJI Inspire 1.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C.  44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing

requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11770
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11770 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
    DJI Phantom 3, and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds including
    payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
    petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on June 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/

Greetings,

By letter from the FAA dated June 8, 2015, an exemption was granted to Crosstimbers Video
Partners for relief under Section 333. That letter was marked Section 333 Exemption No. 11770
Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0895.

Crosstimbers Video Partners hereby requests that the exemption so granted be amended to
include DJI Phantom 3 models and the DJI Inspire 1. Relevant facts and reasoning are:

      DJI has announced they will discontinue the Phantom 2 model which was approved in
          Crosstimbers Video Partners Exemption No. 11770.

      Size, weight and performance specification of the DJI Phantom 3("P3") are substantially
          similar to those of the DJI Phantom 2("P2") in all relevant respects:
                Gross Weight: P3=1280g; P2=1242g.
                Diagonal Size (including propellers): P3=590mm; P2=579mm
                Maximum Ascent Speed: P3=5m/sec; P2=6m/sec.
                Maximum Descent Speed: P3=3m/sec; P2=2m/sec.
                Vertical Hover Accuracy: P3=+/-10cm; P2=+1-80cm.
                Horizontal Hover Accuracy: P3=+/-1 m; P2=+/-2.5m.
                Maximum Speed: P3=16m/sec; P2=15m/sec.

      The DJI Inspire 1 will allow us to progress in our business opening new capabilities and
          added safety through the segregation of duties between the PIC and Camera Operator.
                Gross Weight: 2935g.
                Diagonal Size (including propellers): 559mm to 581 mm.
                Maximum Ascent Speed: 5m/sec.
                Maximum Descent Speed: 4m/sec.
               Vertical Hover Accuracy: 0.5m.
               Horizontal Hover Accuracy: 2.5m.
               Maximum Speed: 22m/sec.
               Flight Time: 18 Minutes
               Dual Controllers allowing the PIC to focus on safe flight and the Camera

                   Operator focus on image quality.

      The findings, rationale and conclusions contained in the FAA's Exemption No. 11770
         apply without modification to this application to include the DJI Phantom 3& DJI Inspire
          1 models in Exemption No. 11770.

Thank you for your consideration of this important request. Please advise us of any additional
information that is required.

Sincerely,

  
                 I/
