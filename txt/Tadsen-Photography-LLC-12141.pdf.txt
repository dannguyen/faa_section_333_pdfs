                                                           Exemption No. 12141
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1549

Mr. Joshua Furnald, Esq.
Counsel for Tadsen Photography LLC
2150 East Washington
Madison, WI 53704

Dear Mr. Furnald:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Tadsen Photography LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography, videography, inspection, and surveying.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI
Phantom 3.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
                                                                                                                 2

consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Tadsen Photography LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Tadsen Photography LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    Vision+, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3 when weighing less than 55 pounds
    including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
    petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be

 II. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL USE OF UAV
The requested exemption would support an application for a commercial Certificate of

                                                                                      1ll
Authorization to use the above described UAV to support the following:
     · Aerial videography of real estate
     · Aerial videography for advertising, media and film
     · Structural inspection
     · Industrial and construction site survey, photography and videography
     · Architectural survey, photography and videography
     · Agricultural survey, photography and videography

Ill. SAFETY IS INCREASED AND DANGER REDUCED BY THE PROPOSED UAV USAGE

Generally, UAVs are safer than full-scale aircraft because UAVs are powered by batteries, are
smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than larger aircraft running on combustible fuel.
Additionally, UAVs operate at lower altitudes with no people on board and will thereby reduce
current risk levels and enhance safety and diminish the likelihood of death or serious bodily
injury. With a small payload, flights below 400 feet AGL, and a maximum flight time of only 45
minutes, UAVs offer little or no risk to national security, the public, air safety or communication.

The proposed specific UAV uses to conduct inspection, filming and videography will reduce hazards
and costs. The UAV's are effective and preferable tools for the type of photography proposed by
Petitioner. Low level, aerial, oblique photos and video from several angles are far more effective
than ground-based imagery for displaying the characteristics oflarge, complex properties,
commercial properties, construction sites, structures and land parcels. Companies in the past
have chartered 2-seat full-sized helicopters or small piloted aircraft for this purpose, which has
proven to be both costly and dangerous. The benefits of reduced cost and improved quality of
presentation and safety from the UAV will be valuable to and benefit the Petitioner and the
consumer public.

Additionally, we request that we be allowed to use our system to benefit first responders nearby
when practicable who might require assistance, including fire fighters, the police, the sheriff, et
al., while remaining subject to all limitations cited in this application as we do so.

IV. THE APPLICANT WILL FOLLOW RESTRICTIONS DICTATED BY N 8900.227

The UAV will be operated with both a PIC and aVO in accordance with FAA Policy N
8900.227 "Operational Requirements for UAV" and with the following Restrictions:

                                 Addendum

    Tadsen Photography LLC. requests an exemption from the aforementioned
regulations as well as any additional regulations that may technically apply to the
operation ofthe UAV.

   I. INTRODUCTION TO PETITIONER

    Tadsen Photography LLC combines the life-long pursuits of aviation and
photography of its Manager and President, Eric Tadsen. Mr. Tadsen developed an
interest in aviation as a child because his father maintained an office at the
Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport. As a teenager, Mr. Tadsen pursued this
hobby, soloed at sixteen and obtained his private pilot's license at the age of nineteen.

    Since obtaining his private pilot's license more than twenty six years ago, Mr.
Tadsen has enjoyed the profession of photography and has accumulated more than
twenty years behind the lens. Mr. Tadsen is an experienced UAV hobbyist who has
logged hundreds ofhours ofUAV flights without incident in the past five years.

    This COA will allow Mr. Tadsen's company, Tadsen Photography LLC, to safely
and efficiently create a business of both aviation and photography though the use of
UAV's, as intended by Congress.

 II. RELEVANT AUTHORITY RELATED TO PETITIONER'S CERTIFICATE OF

           AUTHORIZATION

         This petition for exemption is submitted to advance Congress' goal of
integrating UAV safely into the National Airspace System ("NAS"). In the Reform
Act, Congress directed the FAA "to safely accelerate the integration of civil
unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace system," and, under Section 333 of
that law, directed the Secretary of Transportation ("FAA Administrator") to
consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the NAS
before completion ofthe rule making required under Section 332 ofthe Reform Act. 1

1 Reform Act, Supra Note 1
         In making this determination, the FAA Administrator is required to determine
which types of UAV do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or
pose a threat to national security in light ofthe following:

             · The UAV size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
             · Operation ofthe UAV in close proximity to airports and populated areas;
             and
             · Operation ofthe UAV within visual line-of-sight ofthe operator.2

         Ifthe Secretary determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the
National Airspace System, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe
operation of such aircraft in the National Airspace System."3

         The FAA Administrator has general authority to grant exemptions from
FAA safety regulations and minimum standards when the Administrator decides a
requested exemption is in the public interest.4 A party requesting an exemption must
explain the reasons why the exemption: (1) would benefit the public as a whole and; (2)
would not adversely affect safety or how it would provide a level of safety at least
equal to the existing rules.5 Therefore, the Petitioner will demonstrate how the
proposed UAV infrastructure inspection will benefit the public and that the proposed
operation will not adversely affect safety ofthe public and to those operating in the
NAS.

III. QUALIFICATION FOR APPROVAL UNDER SECTION 333 OF THE REFORM

           ACT

           A. The Petitioner's Proposed Usage Does not Create a Hazard to Users
           of the NAS or the Public Because of the Reduced Size, Weight, Speed and
           Operational Capability of the UAV.

         The proposed operations in this petition for exemption qualify for expedited
approval under Section 333 of the Reform Act. Each of the statutory criteria and
other potentially relevant factors are satisfied.

2 !d. at§ 333(b)(l).
3 !d. § 333(c)(emphasis added).
4 See 49 U.S.C. § 44701(f) (authorizing the grant of exemptions from a requirement of regulations

prescribed purUAnt to section 44701 (a)- (b) and sections 44702-44716).
5 See 14 C.F.R. § 11.81; FAA, Petition for Exemptions

                                                                                                   2
         The proposed operations would permit use of small and relatively inexpensive
UAVs under controlled conditions in airspace that is: (1) limited; (2) predetermined;
(3) controlled as to access, and; (4) would pose an increased level of safety beyond
what exists when the proposed services are completed by manned, full size
aircraft or physical accessing and/or climbing the Communication Facilities,
construction sites or buildings.

         Petitioner's UAVs weigh less than 50 pounds (including payload). Petitioner's
UAV's operate at a speed of no more than 25 knots and have the capability to hover
and move in vertical and horizontal planes simultaneously.

         Such operations will insure that the UAV will "not create a hazard to users of
the National Airspace System or the public" given the small size of the UAV involved
and the restricted environment within which it will operate. This petition for
exemption falls squarely within that zone of safety in which Congress envisioned that
the FAA must, by exemption, allow commercial operations ofUAV to commence
immediately.

          B. The Petitioner's Proposed Usage Does not Create a Hazard to Users
          of the NAS or the Public because the Operation of the UAV will be
           conducted in Controlled or Sterile Locations, Away from Airports and in
          Unpopulated Areas.

         The Petitioner's proposed usage does not create a hazard to users ofthe NAS or
the public because the UAV's shall be flown on Private Property after permission is
secured from the Landlord or Agent. All concerned parties will be given notice prior
to the operations.

           C. The Petitioner's Proposed Usage Does not Create a Hazard to
           Users oftheNAS or the Public because Operation ofUAVs will
           be conducted within VLOS of the PIC or VO at all Times

         Petitioner's UAV will operate in line-of-sight and only in an area described
here and in Exhibits 1, 2, and 3. Petitioner shall not utilize visual aids other than
prescribed glasses or contact lenses. Petitioner shall always:

    · Determine the UAV's proximity to all aviation activities (and other hazards)
         and

    · Exercise effective control ofthe UAV and
                                                                                                                  3
     · Comply with§§ 91.111, 91.113., 91.115, and
     · Prevent the UAV's from creating a collision hazard and
     · VO will inform the PIC when losing sufficient visual contact with the UAV.

            D. The UAV will remain below 400 AGL at all times during the
            operation.

         The Petitioner's UAV will not fly above 400 AGL at any time. The
Petitioner will launch, operate and recover the UAV from the ground level.
Petitioner will not launch, operate or recover the UAV from a structure or building.
The inspection method that Petitioner will utilize will not require the UAV to pass
above 400 feet AGL to successfully complete any inspection. Therefore,
Petitioner's proposed usage will not pose a hazard to the NAS because the UAV will
not operate above 400AGL at any time during the duration of the flight.

         Given the foregoing, the Petitioner's proposed usage does not pose a hazard to
the NAS or to the public. Considering the clear statutory language in Section 333
of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal Aviation Act, as amended,
the equivalent level of safety to the public and to the men and women conducting
infrastructure inspections, and the reduction in environmental effects, the grant ofthe
requested exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully
requests that the FAA grant the requested exemption without delay.

IV. REGULATIONS FROM WHICH EXEMPTION IS REQUESTED

         The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA Administrator the
authority to issue exemptions. By its terms, this statutory authority includes
exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under the Act, including UAV, from
its safety regulations and minimum standards when the Administrator decides a
requested exemption is in the public interest.6

6 See 49 U.S.C. § 4470l(t) authorizing the grant of exemptions from requirements of regulations
prescribed pursuant to§§ 44710(a) and (b),§§ 44702 -· 44716.

                                                                                                 4
          Petitioner asks an exemption from several interrelated provisions of 14 C.F.R.
Parts 21, 45 and 91 for purposes of conducting aerial surveys and inspections using
UAV. Listed below are: (1) the specific sections of 14 C.P.R. for which
exemption is sought; and (2) the operating procedures and safeguards that Petitioner
has established which will ensure a level of safety equal to or better than the rules from
which exemption is sought.7

           A. 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H- Airworthiness Certificates and 14
                C.F.R. §91.203(a)(1).

         The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.P.R. Part 21, Subpart H, which
establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of airworthiness certificates
as required by 14 C.F.R§ 91.203(a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area
associated with the UAV to be utilized by the Petitioner, an exemption from Part 21,
Subpart H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and
Section 333 ofthe Reform Act.

         The Federal Aviation Act8 and Section 333 ofthe Reform Act9 both authorize
the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon
consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability and proximity to
airports and populated areas of the particular UAV. In all cases, an analysis of
these criteria demonstrates that the UAV operated without an airworthiness
certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed will
be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional rotorcraft operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions of the proposed UAV
operations.

           Equivalent Level of Safety
         The UAV to be operated hereunder is less than 50 lbs. fully loaded, carries
neither a pilot nor passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels,
and operates exclusively within a secured area as set out in the Manual. Unlike other

7 See 14 C.F.R. § 11.81(e) which requires a petition for exemption to include: ''the reasons why granting
the exemption would not adversely affect safety, or how the exemption would provide a level of safety at
least equal to that provided by the rule from which you seek exemption."
8 See 49 U.S.C. § 44701(±).
9 See Reform Act, Supra note 1

                                                                                                                            5
civil aircraft, the proposed operations in this petition for exemption will be controlled
and monitored by the operator, pursuant to the Manual's requirements. Moreover, the
PAA will have advance notice of all operations conducted under this exemption.

         These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in
connection with existing inspection operations, provide a greater degree of safety to
the public and property owners than conventional operations conducted with
airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.P.R. Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly,
application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat to
national security posed by the UAV, due to its size, speed of operation, location of
operation, lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to
carry a substantial external load.

           B. 14 C.F.R. Part 27: Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category
                Rotorcraft.

         14 C.P.R. Part 27 sets forth the procedural requirements for airworthiness
certification of normal category rotorcraft. To the extent the Petitioner's UAV
would otherwise require certification under Part 27, as a rotorcraft, Petitioner
requests an exemption from Part 27's airworthiness standards for the same reasons
identified in the exemption request from 14 C.P.R. Part 21, Subpart H.

          C. Aircraft Marking and Identification Requirements: 14 C.F.R. §§
                91.9(c), 45.23(b) and 45.27(a).

          This petition seeks an exemption from the aircraft marking and identification
 requirements of14 C.P.R. §§ 91.9(c), 45.23(b), and 45.27(a).

           14 C.P.R. § 91.9(c), Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard
 requirements, provides that:

                    No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft unless that
                    aircraft is identified in accordance with part 45 of this chapter. 10
           14 C.P.R. § 45.23(b), Markings ofthe Aircraft, states:
                    When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the
                    registration number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport

10 14 C.P.R.§ 91.9(c).

                                                                                            6
                     category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated
                    aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near each
                    entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2
                    inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words "limited,"
                    "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as
                    applicable. 11

           14 C.F.R. § 45.27(a), Rotorcraft, states:
                    Each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that rotorcraft
                    horizontally on both surfaces of the cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail
                    the marks required by §45.23.12

         Exemption from § 45.23(b) is warranted because the UAV has no entrance to
the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station on which the registration number can be placed.
Moreover, given the size of the UAV, two-inch lettering would be impossible.

           Given the nature of the specific relief sought by this exemption request,
Petitioner requires relief from the associated marking and identification requirements
of§ 45.27(a) and § 91.9(c), which would require compliance with§ 45.23(b).

           Equivalent Level of Safety
         An equivalent level of safety for exemptions to the aircraft marking and
identification requirements of§§ 91.9(c), 45.23(b), and 45.27(a), will be provided by
having the UAV marked on its fuselage as required by § 45.29(f) where the pilot,
observer, and others working with the UAV will see the identification ofthe UAVas
"Experimental." Additionally, Petitioner will ensure compliance with any requests of
UAV marking by the FAA.

         The FAA has issued the following exemptions to the aircraft marking
requirements of§ 45.23(b): Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

           D. 14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) and (b): Private Pilot Privileges and
               Limitations: Pilot in Command.

          This petition seeks an exemption from the private pilot privileges and
          limitations of§§ 61.113 (a) and (b), which states:

                   (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) ofthis section, no
                   person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in

II 14 C.F.R. § 45.23(b).
12 14 C.F.R. § 45.27(a).

                                                                                                  7
                    command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for
                    compensation or hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act
                    as pilot in command of an aircraft.

                    (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in
                    command of an aircraft in connection with any business or
                    employment if:

                            (1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment;
                            and

                            (2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for
                            compensati.on or h"Ire. 13

           14 C.P.R.§ 61.113(a) limits private pilots to being in command ofnon-
          commercial flights.
14 C.P.R.§ 61.113(b)(1) provides an exception that allows a private pilot to command
an aircraft without passengers or property, in connection with business or employment
if "[t]the flight is only incidental to that business or employment. 1114 The stated
exception likely does not apply to the proposed operations under this petition for
exemption, as the flights are not incidental to the proposed aerial surveys and
inspections but rather essential to it. Accordingly, the Petitioner seeks an exemption to
14 C.P.R. § 61.113(a)'s commercial limitation and/or 14 C.P.R.§ 61.113(b)(1)'s
requirement that the flight be incidental to the business to benefit from the exception.

          Equivalent Level of Safety
         As required by the Manual, Petitioner's VAV operators acting as PIC will hold
a commercial and/or private pilot certification and have rotorcraft experience.
Because the VAV will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can
achieve the equivalent level of safety to 14 C.P.R. §§ 61.113 (a) and (b).

         Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the VAV
is remotely controlled with no passengers on board. Moreover, the area of operation is
controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned, coordinated, and briefed to the
appropriate official in advance.

13 14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) and (b).
14 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (b)(1)

                                                                                               8
           Petitioner can achieve an equivalent level of safety as achieved by current
Regulations because the UAV does not carry any pilots or passengers. Further, while
helpful, a pilot license will not ensure remote control piloting skills, though
Petitioner's pilot vetting and training programs will ensure the PIC has substantial
experience on the airframe. Further, private pilot licensees will operate Petitioner's
UAV with the same skill. The risks attendant to the operation of Petitioner's UAV
are far less than the risk levels inherent in the commercial activities outlined in 14
C.P.R. § 61, et seq. Thus, allowing Petitioner to operate its UAV with a private pilot
as the PIC will exceed current safety levels in relation to 14 C.P.R.§§ 61.113 (a) and
(b).

           E. 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(B)(2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.

         The Petitioner seeks an exemption from the flight manual requirements of
14 C.P.R. § 91.9(b)(2), which states:

                    (b) No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft

                    (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not
                    required by § 21.5 of this chapter, unless there is available in the
                    aircraft a current approved airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual,
                    approved manual material, markings, and placards, or any
                    combination thereof. 15

         Given its size, configuration, and load capacity, the UAV has no ability to
carry such a manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but
because there is simply no room or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.

          Equivalent Level of Safety
         The safety related purpose of this manual requirement can be equally
satisfied by maintaining the UAV flight manual at the ground control point where
the pilot flying the UAV will have immediate access to it. Accordingly, Petitioner
requests an exemption from § 91.9(b)(2)'s flight manual requirements, on the condition
that the UAV flight manual be available at the control point during each operation.

15 14 C.P.R. §91.8 (b)(2)

                                                                                          9
           The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption
          Nos. 8607,8737,8738,9299,9299A,9565,9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602,
           32827, and 10700.
           F. 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness.

         This petition seeks an exemption from 14 C.P.R. § 91.7(a), which requires
that a civil aircraft be in an airworthy condition to be operated. Inasmuch there
will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the UAV, should this exemption be
granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness.

           Equivalent Level of Safety
        Given the size of the UAV and the requirements contained in the Manual for
maintenance and use of safety checklists prior to each flight, an equivalent level of
safety will be provided.

          The FAA has issued exemptions to this regulation in the following
          situations: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B,
           10167, 10167A, 10602,32827, and 10700.
           G. 14 C.F.R. § 91.103: Preflight Action.

         This petition seeks an exemption from§ 91.103, which requires a PIC to
become familiar with specific information before each flight, including information
contained in the FAA approved Flight Manual on board the aircraft. 16 Inasmuch as an
FAA approved flight manual will not be provided for the UAV, an exemption is
requested.

          Equivalent Level of Safety
         An equivalent level of safety will be provided by following the Aircraft
Operations Manual comprehensive preflight checklist. The PIC will take all
actions, including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff
distances, and aircraft performance data, before initiation of flight.

           H. 14 C.F.R. § 91.109(a): Flight Instruction.

16 14 C.P.R. §91.03

                                                                                        10
         The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.P.R. § 91.109(a), which
provides that "no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon)
that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functional dual
controls."17 UAV and remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully
functional dual controls. Instead, flight control is accomplished through the use
of a control box communicating with the UAV via radio communications.

          Equivalent Level of Safety
         Given the size and speed of the UAV, an equivalent level of safe training
can still be performed without dual controls because no pilot or passengers are
aboard the UAV, and all persons will be a safe distance away should the UAV
experience any difficulties during flight instruction.

         The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training without fully functional
dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in experimental
aircraft. 18

          I. 14 C.F.R. § 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

         This petition seeks an exemption from the minimum safe altitude requirements
of 14 C.F.R.§ 91.119. This Section prescribes the minimum safe altitudes under which
aircraft may not operate, including 500 feet above the surface and away from any
person, vessel, vehicle, or structure in non-congested areas. 19 Section § 91.119(d)(l)
allows for a helicopter to operate at less than those minimum altitudes when it can be
operated "without hazard to persons or property on the surface," provided that "each
person operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes
specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA.

         To provide the intended inspections, the UAV will normally need to be
operated within a range of approximately 50 feet from the infrastructure being
inspected. Accordingly, due to the nature of the proposed operations, the PIC and the
VO may at times be less than 500 feet away from structures during the operation, and
an exemption is therefore required.

17 14 C.P.R.§ 91.109(a).
18 See Exemption Nos. 5778K and 9862A.
19 See 14 C.P.R. § 91.119(c).

                                                                                          11
          Equivalent Level of Safety
         Compared to flight operations with rotorcraft weighing far more than the
maximum 50 pounds proposed herein, and the lack of flammable fuel, any risk
associated with these operations is far less than those presently presented with
conventional aircraft. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size,
weight, speed of the UAV as well as the location where it is operated. As set forth
in the Manual, the UAV will be operated in a restricted area, where buildings and
people will not be exposed to operations. Because of the advance notice, all
affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations as set forth in the
Manual. Furthermore, by operating at such lower altitudes, the UAV will not interfere
with other aircraft that are subject to the minimum safe altitude regulations.

           J. 14 C.F.R. § 91.121: Altimeter Settings.

         The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.121, which
requires a person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude or flight level by
reference to an altimeter that is set to the elevation of the departure airport or
barometric pressure.20 An exemption is required because the UAV does not have a
barometric altimeter, but rather a GPS altitude read out.

          Equivalent Level of Safety
          An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by following the procedures set
 forth in the Manual. As prescribed in the Manual, the operator will confirm the
 altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight. Prior
 to each flight, the PIC will reset the altimeter to zero and will fly the UAV below
 400 feet AGL. Moreover, the PIC will use the GPS altitude indicator to constantly
 monitor the UAV height, thus ensuring operation at safe altitudes.

           K. 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR
                Conditions.

          The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.P.R.§ 91.151(a)'s fuel
 requirements for flight in VFR conditions. Section 91.151 (a) states:

20 See 14 C.F.R. § 91.121.

                                                                                          12
                    (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR
                    conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather
                    conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended
                    landing and, assuming normal cruising speed

                    (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or

                    (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes?1

           The battery powering the UAVs described provide less than one half-hour of
 powered flight. An exemption from the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR §
 91.151 is therefore required.

           Equivalent Level of Safety
         An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 30 minutes
or 25% of battery power, whichever happens first. This restriction would be more than
adequate to return the UAV to its planned landing zone from anywhere within its
limited operating area. Operation of the UAV with less than 30 minutes ofreserve fuel
does not engender the type ofrisks that Section 91.151 (a) was intended to alleviate
given the size and speed of the small UAV. Moreover, operations will be limited
to controlled areas where permission to perform UAV services has been obtained and
all concerned parties given notice.

         This request for exemption falls within the scope of prior exemptions.22
           L. 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.203(a) and (b): Carrying Civilian Aircraft
                Certification and Registration.

         This petition seeks an exemption from civil aircraft certification and
registration requirements of 14 C.P.R. §§ 91.203 (a) and (b). The regulations provide
in pertinent part:

                   (a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil
                    aircraft unless it has within it the following:

                    (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate

21 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a).
22 See e.g. Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate without compliance
with§ 91.151 (a)); see also FAA Exemptions 2689F, 5745, 10673, and 10808.

                                                                                                                         13
                    (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness
                    certificate required by paragraph (a) ofthis section or a special flight
                   authorization issued under § 91.715 is displayed at the cabin or
                    cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.23

         In addition to the fact that Petitioner is seeking an exemption from the
airworthiness certificate requirements, an exemption to this regulation is necessary
because: (1) the UAV's load capacity and size does not allow it to carry certification
and registration documents; (2) the UAV does not have a cabin or cockpit entrance at
which the documents could be displayed; and (3) there are no passengers or crew for
whom the certificates need be displayed.

           Equivalent Level of Safety
         To the extent these regulations are applicable to the proposed UAV
operations, an equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents
at the ground control point where the pilot flying the UAV will have immediate access
to them.

         The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A representative
sample of other exceptions include Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A, 9797,
9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

           M. 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.405(a)(l); 91.407(a)(l); 91.409(a)(l); 91.417(a)
                and (b): Maintenance Inspections

The Petitioner seeks an exemption from the maintenance inspection requirements of
14 C.F.R. §§ 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(2); 91.417 (a) and (b). These
regulations specify maintenance and inspection standards in reference to 14 C.F.R.
Part 43?4 An exemption to these regulations is needed because Part 43 and the
stated sections apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, which the
UAV will not have.

           Equivalent Level of Safety

23 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.203 (a) and (b).
24 See e.g. 14 C.F.R. § 91.405(a) (stating that each owner or operator of an aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections .... have discrepancies

repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter").

                                                                                                     14
         An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because maintenance and
inspections will be performed in accordance with the Aircraft Operations Manual.25
As provided in the Manual, the PIC will ensure that the UAV is in working order prior
to initiating flight, oversee and assist in performance of required maintenance, and
keep a log of any maintenance performed. The PIC is the person most familiar with
the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to
provide the equivalent level of safety.

         If mechanical issues arise, the UAV can land immediately and will be
operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL in an unpopulated area. Moreover, the
UAV's small size, carrying capacity, and the fact that flight operations will only take
place in restricted areas for limited periods oftime, create less risk than the same
factors associated with conventional fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft performing the
same operation.

 V. PUBLIC INTEREST

         Consistent with the requirements of 14 C.P.R. § 11.81(d), Petitioner offers the
following reasons why granting this petition for exemption is in the public interest, i.e.,
how granting it would benefit the public as a whole. Approval of exemptions
allowing commercial operations of small and lightweight UAV in the infrastructure
inspection industry benefits the public as a whole in several ways.

         First, granting the Petitioner's exemption helps fulfill Congress' goal in
passing Section333(a) through (c) ofthe Reform Act, namely, the FAA
Administrator's assessment of whether certain UAV may operate safely in the
National Airspace System before completion of the rule making required under
Section 332 of the Reform Act.

         Next, the Petitioner's proposed operation significantly improves safety and
reduces risk concerning infrastructure inspection by alleviating human exposure to
dangers associated with current aerial survey and inspection methods. Manned
helicopters performing utility-power generation inspections and patrols have
experienced an exceedingly high number of accidents and fatalities.

25 See Manual

               15
         Other Communication Facility inspection methods include utilizing a climber
or team of climbers. To employ this method, human beings must physically climb the
Communication Facility and document the condition ofthe Facility using hand-held cameras.
In 2013 approximately one individual perished per month while conducting these activities.
These deaths and injuries can be completely avoided by replacing this work with a UAV, PIC
andVO.

         Further, Petitioner's UAV are battery powered and create no emissions. If
Petitioner's UAV crashes, there is no fuel to ignite and explode. Any impact of
Petitioner's lightweight UAV is far less than a full size helicopter. The public's interest
is furthered by minimizing ecological impact of an accident and by reducing human
exposure to potentially harmful emissions associated with manned aircraft.

         Finally, aerial surveys and videography/photography are valuable tools for
commercia I inspections. However, problems with safety, cost, statistical integrity,
and logistics continue to impede aerial surveys and inspections from conventional
manned aircraft. The use of UAVs addresses these problems and is a powerful tool
for performing a wide-range of inspection, survey, videography and photography
applications. The public as a whole will benefit from the safer and more cost-effective
utility aerial services that UAV operations provide.
VI. PRIVACY

         All flights will occur over Operations to be conducted over public or
controlled access property. Additionally, all flight operations will be conducted in an
area devoid of spectators or uninvolved participants. All permissions will be gained
by all official personnel, landlords, organizations and/or individuals present in the
surveyed or photographed area.

         Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that "'[a] person traveling in an
automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy ...."'26
Therefore, Petitioners use of UAV does not pose a privacy threat to motorists
traveling on the roadway inadvertently captured on video because they have no
reasonable expectation of privacy. However, to further protect individuals who have

26 U.S. v. Jones, 132 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012) quoting U.S. v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 281 (1983).

                                                                                              16
  had their image captured during an inspection, the Petitioner will sanitize the
  likenesses of individuals from the final product provided to the customer.

VIII. CONCLUSION

            The Petitioner moves the FAA Administrator to grant this exemption. Given the

   level of safety to the public and to the men and women conducting infrastructure
   inspections, and the reduction in environmental effects, the grant ofthe requested
