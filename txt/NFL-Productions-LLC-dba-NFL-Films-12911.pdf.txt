                                                           Exemption No. 12911
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­2139

Mr. Kurt Wimmer
Counsel for NFL Productions LLC dba NFL Films
One CityCenter
850 Tenth Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20001-4956

Dear Mr. Wimmer:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters dated May 20, 2015, and August 11, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of NFL Productions LLC dba NFL Films (hereinafter
petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned
aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial videography and closed-set motion picture and
television filming.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 1, DJI Phantom 2, and DJI Inspire
1.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1 and closed set motion picture and
filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described
by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, NFL Productions LLC dba NFL Films is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

aerial data collection and closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to
the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, NFL Productions LLC dba NFL Films is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 1,
         DJI Phantom 2, and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming
         are permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
                                                                                                            4

    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

         NFL Films proposes that it receive an exemption to use sUAS to gather footage from
closed-set locations in and around NFL stadiums (on non-game days) and NFL practice
facilities. NFL Films would use the footage for the production of television programs. NFL
Films would obtain the consent of all personnel in the stadiums and practice facilities in the
vicinity in which the sUAS may operate.
         The proposed sUAS operation will be conducted safely to minimize risk to the national
airspace system ("NAS") or to persons and property on the ground. NFL Films proposes that
the exemption apply to civil aircraft that operate within the limitations listed below. These
limitations were established in the FAA's grant of Advanced Aerial Cinematography's request for
an exemption:

              1. The sUAS will weigh less than 55 pounds, including payload. Proposed
                   operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend
                   this exemption.

              2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
                   permitted.

              3. The sUAS may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per
                   hour). NFL Films may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to
                   determine compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA
U.S. Department of Transportation

Page 3

                   be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed
                   recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.
              4. The UA will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground
                   level (AGL). Altitude will be reported in feet AGL.
              5. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot in Charge
                   (PIC) at all times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided
                   by any device other than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued
                   airman medical certificate or U.S. driver's license.
              6. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA will be operated within
                   the VLOS of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS
                   requirement as long as the PIC always maintains the VLOS capability. The VO
                   and PIC will be able to communicate verbally at all times; electronic messaging or
                   texting will not be permitted during flight operations. The PIC will be designated
                   before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the duration of the
                   flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the duties required of the VO.
              7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the sUAS and conduct its
                   operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in the grant
                   of exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The
                   operating documents will be accessible during sUAS operations and made
                   available to the Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the
                   conditions and limitations in the exemption and the procedures outlined in the
                   operating documents, the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and
                   will be followed. Otherwise, NFL Films will follow the procedures as outlined in
                   its operating documents. NFL Films may update or revise its operating
                   documents. It is NFL Films' responsibility to track such revisions and present
                   updated and revised documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement
                   official upon request. NFL Films will also present updated and revised
                   documents if it petitions for extension or amendment to this grant of exemption.
                   If NFL Films determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon
                   which the FAA granted this exemption, then NFL Films must petition for an
                   amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-
                   80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the
                   operating documents.
              8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
                   operation or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component,
                   must undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations
                   under this exemption. Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC
                   with a VO and must remain at least 500 feet from other people. The functional
                   test flight must be conducted in such a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard
                   to persons and property.

              9. NFL Films is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it
                   is in a condition for safe operation.

              10. Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine
                   the sUAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection will account
                   for all potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment.
                   If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the sUAS,
                   the aircraft will be prohibited form operating until the necessary maintenance
                   has been performed and the sUAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

              11. NFL Films will follow the sUAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
                   replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
                   components.

              12. Each sUAS operated under this exemption will comply with all manufacturer
                   safety bulletins.

              13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC will hold either an airline transport,
                   commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC will also hold
                   a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by
                   a state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the
                   Federal Government. The PIC also will meet the flight review requirements
                   specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her
                   pilot certificate.

              14. NFL Films will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
                   ability to safely operate the sUAS in a manner consistent with how the sUAS will
                   be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers
                   and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles, and
                   structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner
                   consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the
                   operator's PICs and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and
                   determining the PIC's ability to safely operate the sUAS in a manner consistent
                   with how the sUAS will be operated under this exemption are permitted under
                   the terms of this exemption. However, training operations may only be
                   conducted during dedicated training sessions. During training, proficiency, and
                   experience-building flights, all persons not essential for flight operations are
                   considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with appropriate
                   distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

              15. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 C.F.R. § 1.1.
                   All operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
                   NFL Films will not operate flights under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

              16. The UA will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point
                   (ARP) as denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Director (AFD) or for
                   airports not denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on
U.S. Department of Transportation

                   the current FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with
                   that airport's management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to
                   the exemption holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management will
                   be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon
                   request.
              17. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
                   horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
                   PIC.
              18. If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA will return to a
                   pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.
              19. The PIC will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.
              20. The PIC will be prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and
                   forecast weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to
                   conduct the intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes
                   or with the reserve power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.
              21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
                   operations will be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                   exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
                   operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
              22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial
                   number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                   (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings
                   will be as large as practicable.
              23. Documents used by NFL Films to ensure the safe operation and flight of the sUAS
                   and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be available to
                   the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the sUAS any time the aircraft is
                   operating. These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any
                   law enforcement official upon request.
              24. The UA will remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
                   activities at all times.
              25. The sUAS will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.
              26. All Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
                   persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures, unless:

                        a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect
                             nonparticipating persons from the UA and/or debris in the event of an
                             accident. NFL Films will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain
U.S. Department of Transportation
May 20, 2015
Page 6

                             under such protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating
                             persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight
                             operations will cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of
                             nonparticipating persons; and
                        b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
                             permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a
                             safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and
                             determined that it does not present an undue hazard.
                   The PIC, VO, operator trainees, essential persons, or individuals who have signed
                   consent forms are not considered nonparticipating persons under this
                   exemption.
              27. All operations will be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
                   permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
                   Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
                   obtained for each flight to be conducted.
              28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
                   boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA will be
                   reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.
                   Accidents will be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
                   per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
              If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
              television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations
              apply:
              29. NFL Films will have a motion picture and television operations manual
                   (MPTOM) as documented in this grant of exemption.
              30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, NFL Films will submit a written Plan of
                   Activities to the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction
                   over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day notification may be waived with the
                   concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities must include at least the
                   following:
                        a. Dates and times for all flights;
                        b. Name and phone number of the operator for the sUAS aerial filming
                             conducted under this grant of exemption;
                        c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene
                             operation of the sUAS;
                        d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of the sUAS to be used;
U.S. Department of Transportation

                        e. Name and certificate number of sUAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
                        f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property

                             owners and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the
                             list of those who gave permission will be made available to the inspector
                             upon request;
                        g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
                        h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any
                             area, city, town, county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted
                             and the altitudes essential to accomplish the operation.
              31. Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating
                   persons consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production, as
                   specified in the exemption holder's MPTOM.
         Unless otherwise specified, the sUAS operations will comply with all applicable parts of
14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45, 47, 61, and 91. NFL Films incorporates all
arguments in support of the petition made in Advanced Aerial Cinematography's November 24,
2014 application for exemption.
         Federal Register Notice
         As stated above, publication in the Federal Register is unnecessary because this
application meets the FAA's criteria for summary approval. To the extent that the FAA
determines that publication is necessary, the following summary is provided:
                   Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules: 14 C.F.R. § 21,
                   subpart H; 14 C.F.R 45.23 (b); 14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b); 91.7 (a); 91.9
                   (b)(2); 91.103 (b); 91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203 (a) and (b);
                   91.405 (a); 91.407 (a)(1); 91.409 (a)(2); 91.409 (a)(2) and 91.417 (a) & (b)
                   to operate commercially a small unmanned vehicle (55 lbs or less) in
                   videography operations.
         The Exemption is in the Public Interest
         As demonstrated above, the proposed sUAS operations would minimize the risk of harm
to individual safety or damage to the NAS and property. The operations proposed by NFL Films
would provide tremendous public benefits by enabling millions of NFL fans to view footage that
could not be captured via any other technology. The sUAS operations as described in this
application will be far safer and more efficient than use of helicopters or other aircraft to capture
the required footage.
         The conditions outlined in this petition clearly satisfy Section 333's exemption criteria
regarding "size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas,
and operation within visual line of sight," and therefore the proposed operations would not
U.S. Department of Transportation
May 20, 2015
Page 8

"create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to
national security." As discussed above, NFL Films agrees to use limitations that are substantially
identical to those contained in the FAA's recent grant of exemption for Advanced Aerial
Cinematography. Accordingly, the proposed UAS operations of NFL Films should not raise
safety or national security concerns, and should receive summary approval.

         Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned if you need additional information.
                                                           Respectfully submitted,

     Motion Picture and Television Flight Operation Manual

         A. Purpose

This Manual has been developed by NFL Productions LLC d/b/a NFL Films ("NFL Films") in
conjunction with an application for an exemption from a limited number of regulations pursuant
to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, as
outlined in NFL Films' exemption application dated May 20, 2015, for use of sUAS to gather
footage from closed-set locations in and around NFL stadiums (on non-game days) and NFL
practice facilities. NFL Films' pilots and other company personnel when applicable will comply
with the policies, procedures, and conditions of this Manual, whenever motion picture or
television flight operations are performed that require an exemption.

         B. Pilot/Operator Organization

NFL Productions LLC d/b/a NFL Films -- Operator

Mt. Laurel, NJ 08054
Barry M. Wolper - Chief Financial Officer and applicant/responsible person - (856) 222-3545

         C. Pilots To Be Used During Filming

Pilots to be used during filming will be included in the Plan of Activities to be filed at least three
(3) days prior to each scheduled filming, pursuant to Section H, infra, with the local FSDO
having jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The list of pilots will include each pilot's
pilot certificate number as well as special pilot authorizations or endorsements, if applicable.

         D. List of Aircraft by Make, Model and Serial or Registration Number

A list of aircraft to be used appears in Appendix B, infra. Furthermore, any aircraft to be used in
the proposed filming shall be listed by make, model and serial or registration number in the Plan
of Activities to be filed at least three days prior to each scheduled filming, pursuant to Section H,
infra, with the local FSDO having jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming.

         E. Distribution and Revision

NFL Films will issue a copy of this manual, including all revisions, to all personnel involved in
sUAS operation. All recipients are required to keep their manuals up-to-date with any furnished
revisions.

Amendments in FARs and normal usage will frequently indicate a need for additions, deletions,
or corrections of selected subject matter in this manual. Revisions to the manual will be issued
periodically to reflect these changes. In addition, manual users who observe or experience a
need for change are encouraged to submit their suggestions to the Chief Financial Officer for
review and consideration.

Revisions to the Manual will be forwarded to the Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) at
least 15 days before the proposed effective date. Revisions will be noted on the Revision

                                                   Page 4 of 14
Control Page at the front of this Manual and will be noted in bold in this Manual. Each
subsequent revision of the Manual will be distributed to all company personnel involved in
sUAS operation.

F. Persons Authorized

Section 91.119(c) is waived only with respect to those participating persons, vehicles, and
structures directly involved in the performance of the actual filming. The pilot-in-command and
certificate holder shall ensure that no persons are allowed within 500 feet of the area except those
consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production. This provision may be
reduced to no less than 200 feet in the event that a suitable, equivalent level of safety can be
achieved. An equivalent level of safety may be determined by evaluation of the filming
production area and the degree of terrain features, buildings, etc. that will provide a safety barrier
to observers.

Prior to any filming, the pilot-in-command and certificate holder shall be responsible for

The pilot/operator shall coordinate with the FSDO having geographic responsibility over the area
of the filming operations.

H. Plan of Activities

At least three (3) days prior to any scheduled filming, NFL Films shall submit a written plan of
activities to the local FSDO having jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The plan of
activities shall include the following:

1) Dates and times for all flights.

2) Name and phone number of operator responsible for the filming production
         event.

3) Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation
         of the sUAS.

4) Make, model, and serial number or registration number of aircraft to be used
         and type of airworthiness certificate, including Category (CAT).

                                     Page 8 of 14
             5) Names and certificate numbers of pilots involved in the filming production
                      event.

             6) A statement that permission has been obtained from property owners and/or
                      local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those who
                      gave permission will be made available to the inspector upon request.

             7) Signature of exemption holder or a designated representative.

             8) A general outline, description or summary of the flight activity schedule,
                      including maps or diagrams of any area, city, town, country, and/or state over
                      which filming will be conducted and the altitude essential to accomplish the
                      operation.

At the discretion of the FSDO, the 3-day notification may be waived. Justification of the
exception to the 3-day requirement is needed.

NFL Films acknowledges that prior to the beginning of any filming operations, the plan of
activities must be accepted by the FAA.

         I. Permission to Operate

Before any flight operation is conducted at less than 500 feet under the provisions of the
certificate of waiver and this Manual, the operator will obtain permission to conduct these
operations from property owners and local officials as necessary or appropriate. Persons from
whom permission may be required are listed below:

             1) Property owners

             2) Law enforcement officials

             3) Fire department officials

             4) Local, state and federal government

The NFL Films personnel obtaining such permission will do so in writing whenever practical;
however, verbal permission is acceptable otherwise. A standard permission form is provided in
Appendix A and may be used when obtaining written permission. Written permission forms will
be maintained at the job site until flight operations are completed, and then turned over to NFL
Films to be kept on file for a minimum of six (6) months. These forms will be made available
for inspection by the FAA or other official personnel upon request.

         J. Security

Prior to any flight operation, the operator will coordinate with appropriate production personnel
to devise a plan of securing the area(s) of operation from all unauthorized persons, vehicles and

                                                   Page 9 of 14
aircraft. Provisions will be made to immediately discontinue operations should the area(s)
become unsecured or for any other reason in the interest of safety.

         K. Briefing of Pilots and Production Personnel

Prior to the start of any operation under the provisions of this Manual, the pilot in command will
conduct a briefing of all procedures to participating personnel of the risks involved, emergency
procedures, and safeguards to be following during the filming production event. Personnel will
also be briefed on any additional provisions that may be issued by the local FSDO, including the
location of boundaries or any other time limits.

         L. Certification/Airworthiness

Prior to any flight operation, the pilot in command will conduct a pre-flight inspection in
accordance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) parts 43 and 91 and
applicable operating limitations. The pre-flight inspection will account for all potential
discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items or equipment. If the inspection reveals a
condition that affects the safe operation of the sUAS, the aircraft will be prohibited from
operation until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the sUAS is found to be in a
condition for safe flight.

NFL Films will follow the sUAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul, replacement, inpsection
and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft components. Each sUAS operated under
this exemption will comply with all manufacturer safety bulletins.

The aircraft to be used may be certificated in any CAT, including experimental, provided the
requirements of 14 CFR part 91, §§ 91.7, 91.9, and 91.203 are met.

         M. Pilot Personnel--Minimum Requirements

The pilot in command will hold either an airline transport, commercial, private, recreational, or
sport pilot certificate. The PIC will also hold a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid
U.S. driver's license issued by a state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a
possession, or the Federal Government. The PIC also will meet the flight review requirements
specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

         N. Limitations

Aircraft operations shall conform with the limitations set forth in NFL Films' request for a
limited exemption, dated May 20, 2015, attached to this Manual as Appendix C.

The aircraft will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level (AGL).
Altitude will be reported in feet AGL.

The aircraft will not be operated during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1.

         O. Communications

                                                  Page 10 of 14
Prior to the start of any operation covered by this Manual, the pilot in command will formulate a
plan to provide communications capability to all participants during the actual operation and
filming. Oral, visual or radio communications may be used as long as it is effective and is
capable of keeping the participants continuously apprised of the current status of the operation.

         P. Accident Notification
Should an accident or incident requiring notification of the NTSB occur, the operator would
immediately notify the NTSB pursuant to 49 CFR § 830 and take steps to preserve and protect
the accident scene.

         Q. Recall/Stop Procedures
Radio communication, oral, visual or a combination will be utilized to keep the participants
continuously apprised of the current status of operation.

         R. Aerobatic Competency
If the filming operations require the issuance of FAA Form 8710-7, see Volume 5, Chapter 9,
Section 1, Issue/Renew/Rescind a Statement of Acrobatic Competency.

To Whom It May Concern:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and 14
C.F.R., Part 11, NFL Productions LLC d/b/a NFL Films ("NFL Films"), operator of Small
Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUAS") equipped to conduct aerial videography of professional
football game and training facilities, requests a limited exemption from the below-listed
regulations to allow commercial operation of its sUASs, provided that the proposed sUAS
operations comply with the conditions outlined below or as established by the Federal Aviation
Administration ("FAA") under Section 333.

         The name and address of the applicant is: NFL Productions LLC, One Sabol Way, Mt.
Laurel, N.J. 08054, c/o Barry M. Wolper, Chief Financial Officer, (856) 222-3545,

         NFL Films makes this request under the "summary grant" process that the FAA
announced in April 2015.1 This request is similar in all material respects to a number of recent
grants of exemption, including Grant of Exemption No. 11488 to Advanced Aerial
Cinematography, LLC (FAA Docket No. 2014-0090).2

         Regulations from which the exemption is requested:

         NFL Films proposes that it receive an exemption to use sUAS to gather footage from
closed-set locations in and around NFL stadiums (on non-game days) and NFL practice
facilities. NFL Films would use the footage for the production of television programs. NFL
Films would obtain the consent of all personnel in the stadiums and practice facilities in the
vicinity in which the sUAS may operate.
         The proposed sUAS operation will be conducted safely to minimize risk to the national
airspace system ("NAS") or to persons and property on the ground. NFL Films proposes that
the exemption apply to civil aircraft that operate within the limitations listed below. These
limitations were established in the FAA's grant of Advanced Aerial Cinematography's request for
an exemption:

              1. The sUAS will weigh less than 55 pounds, including payload. Proposed
                   operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend
                   this exemption.

              2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
                   permitted.

              3. The sUAS may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per
                   hour). NFL Films may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to
                   determine compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA
U.S. Department of Transportation
May 20, 2015
Page 3

                   be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed
                   recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.
              4. The UA will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground
                   level (AGL). Altitude will be reported in feet AGL.
              5. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot in Charge
                   (PIC) at all times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided
                   by any device other than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued
                   airman medical certificate or U.S. driver's license.
              6. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA will be operated within
                   the VLOS of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS
                   requirement as long as the PIC always maintains the VLOS capability. The VO
                   and PIC will be able to communicate verbally at all times; electronic messaging or
                   texting will not be permitted during flight operations. The PIC will be designated
                   before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the duration of the
                   flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the duties required of the VO.
              7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the sUAS and conduct its
                   operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in the grant
                   of exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The
                   operating documents will be accessible during sUAS operations and made
                   available to the Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the
                   conditions and limitations in the exemption and the procedures outlined in the
                   operating documents, the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and
                   will be followed. Otherwise, NFL Films will follow the procedures as outlined in
                   its operating documents. NFL Films may update or revise its operating
                   documents. It is NFL Films' responsibility to track such revisions and present
                   updated and revised documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement
                   official upon request. NFL Films will also present updated and revised
                   documents if it petitions for extension or amendment to this grant of exemption.
                   If NFL Films determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon
                   which the FAA granted this exemption, then NFL Films must petition for an
                   amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-
                   80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the
                   operating documents.
              8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
                   operation or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component,
                   must undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations
                   under this exemption. Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC
                   with a VO and must remain at least 500 feet from other people. The functional
                   test flight must be conducted in such a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard
                   to persons and property.

              9. NFL Films is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it
                   is in a condition for safe operation.

              10. Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine
                   the sUAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection will account
                   for all potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment.
                   If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the sUAS,
                   the aircraft will be prohibited form operating until the necessary maintenance
                   has been performed and the sUAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

              11. NFL Films will follow the sUAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
                   replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
                   components.

              12. Each sUAS operated under this exemption will comply with all manufacturer
                   safety bulletins.

              13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC will hold either an airline transport,
                   commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC will also hold
                   a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by
                   a state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the
                   Federal Government. The PIC also will meet the flight review requirements
                   specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her
                   pilot certificate.

              14. NFL Films will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
                   ability to safely operate the sUAS in a manner consistent with how the sUAS will
                   be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers
                   and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles, and
                   structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner
                   consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the
                   operator's PICs and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and
                   determining the PIC's ability to safely operate the sUAS in a manner consistent
                   with how the sUAS will be operated under this exemption are permitted under
                   the terms of this exemption. However, training operations may only be
                   conducted during dedicated training sessions. During training, proficiency, and
                   experience-building flights, all persons not essential for flight operations are
                   considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with appropriate
                   distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

              15. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 C.F.R. § 1.1.
                   All operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
                   NFL Films will not operate flights under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

              16. The UA will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point
                   (ARP) as denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Director (AFD) or for
                   airports not denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on
U.S. Department of Transportation

                   the current FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with
                   that airport's management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to
                   the exemption holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management will
                   be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon
                   request.
              17. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
                   horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
                   PIC.
              18. If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA will return to a
                   pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.
              19. The PIC will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.
              20. The PIC will be prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and
                   forecast weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to
                   conduct the intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes
                   or with the reserve power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.
              21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
                   operations will be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                   exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
                   operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
              22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial
                   number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                   (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings
                   will be as large as practicable.
              23. Documents used by NFL Films to ensure the safe operation and flight of the sUAS
                   and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be available to
                   the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the sUAS any time the aircraft is
                   operating. These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any
                   law enforcement official upon request.
              24. The UA will remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
                   activities at all times.
              25. The sUAS will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.
              26. All Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
                   persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures, unless:

                        a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect
                             nonparticipating persons from the UA and/or debris in the event of an
                             accident. NFL Films will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain
U.S. Department of Transportation

Page 6

                             under such protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating
                             persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight
                             operations will cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of
                             nonparticipating persons; and
                        b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
                             permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a
                             safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and
                             determined that it does not present an undue hazard.
                   The PIC, VO, operator trainees, essential persons, or individuals who have signed
                   consent forms are not considered nonparticipating persons under this
                   exemption.
              27. All operations will be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
                   permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
                   Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
                   obtained for each flight to be conducted.
              28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
                   boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA will be
                   reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.
                   Accidents will be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
                   per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
              If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
              television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations
              apply:
              29. NFL Films will have a motion picture and television operations manual
                   (MPTOM) as documented in this grant of exemption.
              30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, NFL Films will submit a written Plan of
                   Activities to the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction
                   over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day notification may be waived with the
                   concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities must include at least the
                   following:
                        a. Dates and times for all flights;
                        b. Name and phone number of the operator for the sUAS aerial filming
                             conducted under this grant of exemption;
                        c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene
                             operation of the sUAS;
                        d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of the sUAS to be used;
U.S. Department of Transportation

                        e. Name and certificate number of sUAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
                        f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property

                             owners and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the
                             list of those who gave permission will be made available to the inspector
                             upon request;
                        g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
                        h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any
                             area, city, town, county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted
                             and the altitudes essential to accomplish the operation.
              31. Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating
                   persons consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production, as
                   specified in the exemption holder's MPTOM.
         Unless otherwise specified, the sUAS operations will comply with all applicable parts of
14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45, 47, 61, and 91. NFL Films incorporates all
arguments in support of the petition made in Advanced Aerial Cinematography's November 24,
2014 application for exemption.
         Federal Register Notice
         As stated above, publication in the Federal Register is unnecessary because this
application meets the FAA's criteria for summary approval. To the extent that the FAA
determines that publication is necessary, the following summary is provided:
                   Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules: 14 C.F.R. § 21,
                   subpart H; 14 C.F.R 45.23 (b); 14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b); 91.7 (a); 91.9
                   (b)(2); 91.103 (b); 91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203 (a) and (b);
                   91.405 (a); 91.407 (a)(1); 91.409 (a)(2); 91.409 (a)(2) and 91.417 (a) & (b)
                   to operate commercially a small unmanned vehicle (55 lbs or less) in
                   videography operations.
         The Exemption is in the Public Interest
         As demonstrated above, the proposed sUAS operations would minimize the risk of harm
to individual safety or damage to the NAS and property. The operations proposed by NFL Films
would provide tremendous public benefits by enabling millions of NFL fans to view footage that
could not be captured via any other technology. The sUAS operations as described in this
application will be far safer and more efficient than use of helicopters or other aircraft to capture
the required footage.
         The conditions outlined in this petition clearly satisfy Section 333's exemption criteria
regarding "size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas,
and operation within visual line of sight," and therefore the proposed operations would not
U.S. Department of Transportation
May 20, 2015
Page 8

"create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to
national security." As discussed above, NFL Films agrees to use limitations that are substantially
identical to those contained in the FAA's recent grant of exemption for Advanced Aerial
Cinematography. Accordingly, the proposed UAS operations of NFL Films should not raise
safety or national security concerns, and should receive summary approval.

         Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned if you need additional information.
                                                           Respectfully submitted,
