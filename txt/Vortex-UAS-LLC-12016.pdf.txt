Dear Messrs. Doran and Hogan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Vortex UAS, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial photography and videography, precision agriculture, geosurvey, aerial
mapping, aerial monitoring services for first responders, sUAS pilot training1, utility
inspection, and real estate inspection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

1The petitioner also requested authority to conduct UAS training. At this time, the FAA is unable to authorize
UAS operations for training until a further assessment is completed. When the FAA completes its review, we
will proceed accordingly and no further action will be required by the petitioner. However, the petitioner is
permitted to train its own pilot in commands and visual observers in accordance with condition no. 14 and the
other conditions and limitations in this exemption.
                                                                                                                 2

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 Vision, DJI Spreading Wings
S900, and PrecisionHawk Hawkeye Mk-III.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection2. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

2Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                        3

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Vortex UAS, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Vortex UAS, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    Vision, DJI Spreading Wings S900, and PrecisionHawk Hawkeye Mk-III when
    weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other

    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
                                                                                                            4

    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.
                                                                                                            5

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.
                                                                                                            6

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.
                                                                                               7

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:

                             Summary of Applicant's Scope of Operations

         The Applicant proposes to conduct commercial sUAS operations in the six areas
specified above (the "Proposed Operations"). The Applicant has developed a set of "Standard
Operating Procedures for Flight Operations" (the "SOP") that sets forth the standards for
performing the Proposed Operations.1 The SOP provides a baseline to ensure that all operations,
including training operations, are conducted safely within the National Airspace System
("NAS").

         Each operation will be initiated following a discrete COA application. The Applicant
proposes to conduct its commercial operations in Operations Areas that are clearly defined in
each COA application (the "Operations Areas").

         The Pilot in Command ("PIC") for each operation will hold, at a minimum, a private pilot
certificate. The students training under the PIC in each operation will meet the standards
specified in the SOP, as well as any other additional requirement the FAA requires under this

1 A copy of the SOP is enclosed as Attachment 1. The SOP is submitted as a Confidential
Document under 14 C.F.R. § 11.35(b). The entire SOP contains proprietary information that the
Applicant has not and will not share with others. The SOP contains operating conditions and
procedures that are not available to the public and are protected from release under 5 U.S.C.
section 552, et seq. A hard copy of the SOP will be submitted under a separate cover letter
referencing the docket number of this exemption request.

                                                          2
application. The PIC and the students in training will be specifically trained to operate the sUAS
platforms utilized in the Applicant's operations.

                                 Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         The Applicant's commercial operations and training activities will take place in
Operations Areas defined by the Applicant's COA applications prior to each commercial flight
or training exercise. The sUAS operations in these Operations Areas will pose little risk of injury
or property damage.

         The Applicant proposes to use the following sUAS platforms for its operations under this
application:

1. The sUAS will weigh less than 55 lbs including energy sources and equipment.
2. The sUAS will be flown at a speed less than a ground speed of 50 knots.
3. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.
4. Flights will be operated within line of sight of the Pilot in Command (PIC) at all

         times.
5. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The VO and PIC will be in

         communications at all times.
6. The Applicant's SOP and the relevant Manufacturer Instructions will be

         maintained and made available to the FAA upon request.
7. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the sUAS to ensure it is in a condition for

         safe flight.
8. The Applicant will follow the manufacturer's sUAS aircraft and component

         maintenance, overhaul, replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements.
9. The PIC will possess at least a private pilot certificate and a third-class medical

         certificate. The PIC will also meet the flight review requirements specified in 14
         CFR 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his/her pilot certificate.
10. The sUAS will not be operated directly over any person below an altitude that is
         hazardous to persons or property on the surface in the event of an sUAS failure or
         emergency.
11. The Applicant will utilize the documented emergency procedures appropriate to
         each sUAS platform in the event of engine or power failure, fire, loss of control
         link, loss of GPS, loss of telemetry data link, and loss of video downlink. These
         procedures shall be those set forth in the Applicant's SOP and the Manufacturer
         Instructions.
12. The Applicant will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of
         Waiver or Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the
         grant of exemption. The COA will require the operator to request a Notice to
         Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but not less than 48 hours
         prior to the operation.
13. If required, the word "Experimental" will be placed on the fuselage in compliance
         with § 45.29 (f). The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the
         sUAS marked on its fuselage as required by § 45.29(f) where the pilot, observer
         and others working with the sUAS will see the identification of the sUAS as
         "Experimental." The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation
         to Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A. The FAA has also waived
         the marking requirement entirely in other Section 333 Exemption applications,
         such as Exemptions Nos. 11109 and 11110.

                                                 4

         d. Name and certificate number of sUAS PIC.
         e. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property
                  owners and/or local officials to conduct the flight.
         f. Signature of exemption holder or representative.
         g. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of the area
                  where the flight will be conducted.

17. The documents required under 14 C.F.R. sections 91.9 and 91.203 will be
         available to the PIC at the ground control station of the sUAS any time the aircraft
         is operating.

18. The sUAS will remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned
         operations and activities at all times (including, but not limited to, ultralight
         vehicles, parachute activities, parasailing activities, hang gliders, etc.).

19. sUAS operation will be conducted during daylight hours.
20. The sUAS will be operated by the PIC from a stationary position, i.e., not from

         any moving device or vehicle.
21. The sUAS will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet

         horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
         PIC.
22. The sUAS will not operate in Class B, C, or D airspace without written approval
         from the FAA. The sUAS will not operate within 5 nautical miles of the
         geographic center of a non-towered airport as denoted on a current FAA-
         published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
         management is obtained and the operation is conducted in accordance with a
         NOTAM as required by the operator's COA.
23. Any 1) incident, 2) accident, or 3) flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
         vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA will
         be reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.
         Accidents will be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)

                                                 5
                  per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site. Further flight operations will
                  not be conducted until the incident, accident, or transgression is reviewed by
                  AFS-80 and authorization to resume operations is provided.

                   Regulations From Which the Applicant Requests Exemption

         The Applicant requests exemption from the following regulations:

         14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H
         14 C.F.R. § 45.23(b)
         14 C.F.R. § 61.113(a), (b)

         14 C.F.R. § 91.405(a), (b)
         14 C.F.R. § 91.407(a)(1)
         14 C.F.R. § 91.409(a)(1)-(2)
         14 C.F.R. § 91.417(a), (b)

         The sUAS platforms the Applicant seeks approval to use through this exemption request
all weigh 55 pounds or fewer, including payload. They operate, under normal conditions at a
speed of no more than 50 knots. The rotorcraft platforms have the capability to hover and move
in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously. Each sUAS platform will operate only in
visual line of sight and will operate only within the Operations Areas defined by the discrete
COA applications filed prior to each flight. These operations will ensure that the sUAS will "not
create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public," as contemplated by
Section 333(b) of FMRA.

         Given the small size of the sUAS platforms involved and the limited environments within
which they will operate, the applicant falls squarely within that zone of safety (an equivalent
level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption, allow
commercial operations of sUAS to commence immediately. Also, due to the size of the sUAS
platforms and the defined areas in which the relevant sUAS will operate, approval of the

                                                          6
application presents no national security issue. Given the clear direction in Section 333 of the
FMRA, the authority contained in the Federal Aviation Act, as amended; the strong equivalent
level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and the significant public benefit in
producing graduates that are trained in sUAS operations, it is in the public interest to grant the
requested exemption. Accordingly, the applicant respectfully requests that the FAA grant the
requested exemption without delay.

                              Narrative Regarding Requested Exemptions

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a)(1)

         The FAA has previously determined that no airworthiness certification is necessary for
sUAS platforms. See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110. The Applicant therefore believes that no
exemption is necessary from Part 21, Subpart H.

         To the extent that the FAA finds that Part 21 is applicable to the Applicant's proposed
operations, the Applicant requests an exemption from it. Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness
Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of airworthiness certificates
as required by 14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area associated
with the sUAS platforms to be utilized by the Applicant, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H
meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the
FMRA. The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.§ 44701(f)) and Section 333 of the FMRA both
authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate upon
consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and
populated areas of the particular sUAS. In all cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates
that the sUAS operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and
under the conditions proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft
operating with an airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

         The sUAS platforms to be operated under this exemption all weigh less than 55 pounds,
fully loaded. The platforms carry no pilots or passengers, no explosive materials or flammable
liquid fuels, and will operate exclusively within the Operations Areas defined in this application.
Operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by the operator. The
FAA will have advance notice of all operations. These safety enhancements provide a greater
degree of safety to the public and property owners than conventional operations conducted with
airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H. Application of these same
criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security posed by the sUAS
platforms due to their size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack of explosive materials
or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial external load.

                                                          7
14 C.F.R. § 45.23(b). Marking of the Aircraft

         The FAA has previously determined that an exemption from § 45.23(b) is not required
for sUAS platforms that do not need to be certified under Part 21. See, e.g., Exemption No.
11110. The Applicant therefore believes that no exemption is necessary from 14 C.F.R.
§ 45.23(b). To the extent that the FAA finds that § 45.23(b) is applicable to the Applicant's
intended operations, the Applicant requests an exemption therefrom as follows.

         The regulation requires:

                  When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the
                  registration number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport
                  category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated
                  aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near each
                  entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less
                  than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words "limited,"
                  "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as
                  applicable.

         Even though the sUAS platforms will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption
may be needed as the sUAS will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which
the word "Experimental" can be placed. Given the size of the sUAS platforms, two-inch
lettering may be impossible. The word "Experimental" will be placed on the fuselage in
compliance with 14 C.F.R. § 45.29(f).

         The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the sUAS marked on its
fuselage as required by 14 C.F.R. § 45.29(f) where the pilot, observer and others working with
the sUAS will see the identification of the sUAS as "Experimental." The FAA has issued the
following exemptions to this regulation to Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command

         Sections 61.113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the
sUAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent
level of safety of current operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have a private
pilot's certificate rather than a commercial pilot's certificate to operate this sUAS. Unlike a
conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the sUAS is remotely controlled with
no living thing on board. The Operations Areas will be controlled and all flights will be planned

                                                          8
and coordinated in advance. The level of safety provided by the requirements included in the
Applicant's SOP and the Manufacturer Instructions exceeds that provided by a single individual
holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a conventional aircraft. The risks associated
with the operation of sUAS are so diminished from the level of risk associated with commercial
operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that allowing operations of sUAS as requested
with a private pilot as the PIC exceeds the present level of safety achieved by 14 C.F.R. § 61.113
(a) & (b). The FAA has approved sUAS operations with a private pilot's certificate in other
exemptions. See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110.

14 C.F.R. § 61.3(d)(2)(iii): Requirement for Certificates, Ratings, and Authorizations

         The regulation requires that "no other person other than the holder of a flight instructor
certificate issued under this part with the appropriate rating on that certificate may . . . [e]ndorse
a pilot logbook to show training given." The Applicant requests exemption from this regulation
as the PIC performing training activities under this exemption may not hold an FAA-issued flight
instructor certificate. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the Applicant's adherence
to the procedures set forth in the SOP and the Manufacturer Instructions.

14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

         The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness. An
equivalent level of safety will be provided by the small size of the aircraft and the requirements
contained in the SOP and Manufacturer Instructions for maintenance and use of safety check lists
prior to each flight. The Applicant will ensure that the sUAS is in an airworthy condition prior to
each flight based on compliance with the specifications in the SOP and Manufacturer
Instructions.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b)(2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft

         Section 91.9(b)(2) provides:

                  No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft ...

                  (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not
                  required by § 21.5 of this chapter, unless there is available in the
                  aircraft a current approved airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual,

                                                          9
                  approved manual material, markings, and placards, or any
                  combination thereof.

         The sUAS platforms, given their size and configuration, have no ability or place to carry
a flight manual. An equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at
the ground control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to it. The
FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738,
9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and 10700. The FAA has previously
determined that an exemption from this regulation is not necessary, as relevant materials may be
kept in a location accessible to the PIC and not on the sUAS itself. See Exemption No. 11110.

14 C.F.R. § 91.103: Preflight action

         This regulation requires each pilot in command to take certain actions before flight to
insure the safety of flight. As FAA approved flight manuals will not be provided for the aircraft
an exemption will be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be provided through the PIC
following the procedures set forth in the SOP and Manufacturer Instructions. The PIC will take
all actions including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff
distances and aircraft performance data before initiation of flight. The PIC will account for all
relevant site-specific conditions in the preflight procedures. The FAA has granted exemption
from this regulation to other sUAS operators. See Exemption No. 11109.

14 C.F.R. § 91.109: Flight instruction

         Section 91.109 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free
balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual
controls. By their design, sUAS and remotely piloted aircraft do not have fully functional dual
controls. Flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with
the aircraft via radio communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training
without fully functional dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in
experimental aircraft. See Exemption Nos. 5778K and 9862A. The equivalent level of safety
provided by the fact that neither a pilot nor passengers will be carried in the aircraft and by the
size and speed of the aircraft.

         For sUAS platforms that require manual flight control, the PIC and the student that the
PIC is training will use a "buddy box" system utilizing two transmitters. The PIC instructor will
be able to control the sUAS with his or her transmitter, flip a switch to transfer control to the
student, and may flip the switch again to regain control. In this manner, the PIC instructor can
demonstrate how to fly the sUAS or perform a "rescue" of the sUAS if the student makes a poor

                                                         10
aeronautical decision. Use of the buddy box system allows this level of control without having
the PIC and student pass a physical controller between them.

         When the PIC is performing training on sUAS platforms that utilize a computer, tablet, or
other non-radio transmitter as their primary source of control, the PIC will provide an equivalent
level of safety through the use of a radio transmitter that can override autonomous control via a
switch located on the radio transmitter. When this switch is activated, control is transferred from
the autopilot to the transmitter, immediately taking the autopilot offline. The sUAS will then be
operated in the same manner as a basic radio controlled aircraft. The PIC will maintain visual
line of sight at all times in order to determine whether such intervention becomes necessary.

14 C.F.R. § 91.119: Minimum safe altitudes

         Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119(d)
allows helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person
operating the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the
FAA. As this exemption is for sUAS that are similar to helicopters, and the exemption requests
authority to operate at altitudes up to 400 AGL, an exemption may be needed to allow such
operations. The sUAS platforms will not be operated at higher than 400 AGL.

         The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the sUAS
platforms as well as the locations where they are operated. The low-altitude operations of the
sUAS platforms will ensure separation between these sUAS operations and the operations of
conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121: Altimeter Settings

         This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the sUAS platforms may not have a barometric
altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level
of safety will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the SOP and Manufacturer Instructions,
confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

         Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under
VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel
to fly to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ (1) During the

                                                         11
day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45
minutes."

         Given the limitations on the proposed Operations Areas, a longer time frame for VFR
conditions is reasonable. Applicant believes that an exemption from 14 CFR § 91.151(a) falls
within the scope of prior exemptions. See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin
Corporation to operate without compliance with 14 C.F.R. § 91.151 (a)).

         Operating the sUAS platforms in controlled Operations Areas does not engender the type
of risks that Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed of the sUAS
platforms. Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions
2689F, 5745, 10673, and 10808.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration

         The FAA has previously determined that no airworthiness certification is necessary for
sUAS platforms. See, e.g., Exemption No. 11110. The Applicant therefore believes that no
exemption is necessary from § 91.203. However, to the extent that the FAA finds that section
91.203 is applicable to the Applicant's operations, the Applicant requests an exemption
therefrom.

         The regulation provides in pertinent part:

                  (a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a
                  civil aircraft unless it has within it the following:

                  (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate. . . .

                  (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the
                  airworthiness certificate required by paragraph (a) of this section
                  or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is displayed
                  at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or
                  crew.

         The sUAS platforms weigh no more than 55 pounds fully loaded, and are operated
without an onboard pilot. As such, there is no ability or place to carry certification and
registration documents or to display them on the sUAS.

                                                         12
         An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to them, to the extent
they are applicable to the sUAS. The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A
representative sample of other exceptions includes Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A,
9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

14 C.F.R. § 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections

         These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of
this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

         Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to the Applicant. Maintenance will be accomplished by
the operator pursuant to the SOP and the Manufacturer Instructions. An equivalent level of safety
will be achieved because these sUAS are very limited in size, will carry a small payload, and will
operate only in defined Operations Areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise
the sUAS platforms can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet
AGL. As provided in the SOP and Manufacturer Instructions, the operator will ensure that the
sUAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform required maintenance, and will keep a
log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the operator is the person most familiar with the
aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the
equivalent level of safety.

                                         Federal Register Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

                  Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:
                  14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H; 14 C.F.R. § 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. §
                  61.113(a), (b); 14 C.F.R. § 61.3(d)(2)(iii); 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a), (b);
                  14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. § 91.103; 14 C.F.R. § 91.109; 14
                  C.F.R. § 91.119(b), (c); 14 C.F.R. § 91.121; 14 C.F.R. §
                  91.151(a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a), (b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.405(a),
                  (b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.407(a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409(a)(1)-(2); and 14
                  C.F.R. § 91.417(a), (b), to operate a small unmanned aircraft
                  system weighing less than fifty-five pounds for training purposes.

                                                         13
         Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUAS platforms for
commercial purposes will enhance safety by providing services to customers without the danger
and cost associated with manned aircraft. Approval of commercial training of sUAS pilots will
enhance safety by providing trained sUAS pilots for hire to the commercial sUAS industry. The
operation of sUAS, weighing less than 55 pounds, conducted in accord with the conditions
outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exemptions
requested herein, including exempting the applicant from the requirements of Part 21 and
allowing commercial operations. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to the
ground, and in a sterile environment. As a result, sUAS are far safer than conventional operations
conducted with manned aircraft.

                                           Privacy Considerations

         All flights will be conducted in the Operations Areas defined in the Applicant's discrete
pre-flight COA applications. These areas will present no privacy issues of consequence.

                                                   Conclusion

         The Applicant requests that the FAA grant the exemption requested herein. The
Applicant looks forward to training the next generation of sUAS pilots that will carry the
commercial industry forward.

                                                               Respectfully Submitted,

3 Preparing the Remote Controller

  The PHANTOM 2 VISION remote control is a wireless communication device that uses the 5.8GHz frequency
  band. It is compliant with CE and FCC (see the FCC ID) regulations and is set to Mode 2 and CE compliance
  before delivery. If FCC compliance is required, it can be configured by twisting the potentiometer knob on the
  back of the remote controller. The stick configuration can also be reset in the PHANTOM RC assistant software.
  Please refer to < PHANTOM RC Assistant> and <Compliance Configuration> for details.

             (1) CE compliant devices have an effective communication range of 300 meters in open spaces due
                     to power limitations. Be sure to watch your fight distance as the PHANTOM 2 VISION will enter
                     Failsafe mode (auto-landing or go home and land) if it flies beyond this range.

             (2) FCC compliant devices have an effective range of 500 meters in open spaces. Be sure to watch
                     your fight distance as the PHANTOM 2 VISION will enter Failsafe mode (auto-landing or go
                     home and land) if it flies beyond this range.

             (3) Pay attention to and follow local laws and regulations.

  1. Install the four AA Batteries (not included) into the battery compartment on the back of the remote
        controller according to the negative and positive poles.

  2. Set the S1 and S2 switches to the upper most position and all sticks are at mid-point before switching on
        the power switch.

  3. There is a power on indicator beep. If the remote controller is set to be CE compliant, then there will be
        one beep while the FCC compliant version will emit 2 beeps. The power indicator blinks green quickly
        indicating the remote controller and receiver is linking. Once fully linked, the power indicator will change
        to a solid green.

                       operation of the remote controller.

             The remote controller will blink the LED and sound an alert when the voltage drops below 3.9V and
             automatically power off after 3 seconds. This process will repeat even if you power cycle the remote
             controller. If this low voltage warning occurs during flight, the remote controller will automatically
             power off causing the aircraft to enter Failsafe mode which cannot be interrupted (refer to <Failsafe
             Function> section for details). It is strongly recommended to replace batteries if the 3.9V-4.5V low
             voltage warning occurs.

3.4 Antenna Orientation

  Try to keep the antenna pointing skyward, perpendicular to the ground, in order to achieve the maximum
  communication range during flight.

                                                  prematurely during flight.
                                                  The Mobile Device and Range Extender should
                                                  not block the antenna.

3.5 Remote Controller Operation
 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote controller are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote controller is pushed away from the central position.

                                                  The throttle stick controls the aircraft elevation.
                                                  Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                                  Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                                  The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its height
                                                  if the sticks are centered.
                                                  Push the throttle stick above the centered (neutral)
                                                  position to cause the aircraft to take-off. We suggest
                                                  that you push the throttle stick slowly to prevent the
                                                  aircraft from sudden and unexpected elevation.
                                                  The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder.

4 Preparing the Range Extender

  The PHANTOM 2 VISION range extender is a wireless communication device that operates within the 2.4 GHz
  frequency band and is used for extending the effective range of communication between a mobile device
  (Smartphone) and the PHANTOM 2 VISION. In an open unobstructed area, the transmission distance can reach
  up to 300 meters, but is usually affected by the surrounding environment, such as trees, buildings and other
  sources of the same frequency. Before every flight, it is suggested that you ensure the range extender functions
  properly. Otherwise you may experience a communication issue with the mobile device and the PHANTOM 2
  VISION.
  Each range extender has a unique MAC address and network name (SSID), details of which are printed on the
  back label as `Phantom_1xxxxx'. The `xxxxx' represents the last five letters or numbers of the MAC address for
  the range extender.

7.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

   It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300
          times.

   It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge
          cycles. Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can
          no longer be turned on. Refer to the DJI VISION App for an exact readout of the battery percentage
          level. You should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling procedure will
          ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.

   Turn the power OFF when you have finished flying and remove the battery from its compartment.
   Take the battery out of the aircraft after every flight and store the battery in a safe and secure place.
   Adhere to the notes for the battery in the disclaimer and regard safety as your first priority.
   The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 10 to 40, and be discharged in an

          environment that is between -20 to 60. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
          that the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
   It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
   Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
   Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
          concrete and never near any flammable materials.

8.2 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

  The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards
  and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller
  contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver and LED indicators. The IMU (Inertial
  Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both attitude and
  altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System) to
  accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver
  is used to communicate with the remote controller and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control
  system connecting and controlling all the modules together.

8.3 LED Flight Indicators Description

After powering on the intelligent battery, the LED flight indicators light up to show the aircraft's current status.

10 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.
  The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads
  to poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to
  perform at its optimal level.

10.1 Calibration Warnings

          (1) DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong magnetic
                   interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement underground.

          (2) DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular phones.
          (3) Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will not work properly.

10.2 Calibration Procedures

Choose an open space to carry out the following procedures. Please watch the quick start video of the PHANTOM

2 VISION for more compass calibration details.

10.3 When Recalibration is Required

(1) When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
(2) Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
(3) The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
(4) Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

11 Flight

11.1 Flying Environment Requirements

             (1) Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                     practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

             (2) DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
             (3) The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                     within buildings may interfere with the compass.
             (4) Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
             (5) Try to avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment. (No base

                     stations or cell towers around)
             (6) The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
             (7) All parts must be kept out of the reach of children to avoid CHOKING HAZARDS; if a child has

                     accidentally swallowed any part, you should seek immediate medical assistance.

11.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors instead of simply pushing the throttle stick up.
This is a safety precaution to prevent the motors from accidentally spinning up. Push both sticks to their bottom
corners as indicated in the diagram below to start the motors. Once the motors have spun up, release both sticks
simultaneously. The same combination stick command (CSC) is used to stop the motors.

11.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTON 2 VISION on the ground with the battery level indicator facing you.
  2. Power on the remote controller.
  3. Power on the range extender.
  4. Switch the camera to the "WIFI ON" position.
  5. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery, refer to <Battery Usage> for details.
  6. Connect the mobile device to the PHANTOM 2 VISION and then run the DJI VISION App to enter the

          camera preview page.
  7. Wait until the LED flight indicator starts to slowly blink green/yellow. This means the aircraft is initializing

          and entering the "Ready to Fly"/"Ready to Fly (non-GPS)." state. Then proceed to execute the CSC

          command to start motors.
  8. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Controller Operation

          Mode> for more details.
  9. Enjoy your flight while capturing and recording with the DJI VISION App. Refer to the<DJI VISION App

          Usage> for more details.
  10. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down on the throttle stick gently to descend and land.
  11. After landing the aircraft on the ground, keep the throttle stick at its lowest position for about 3 to 5

          seconds which will automatically stop the motors.

                     You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause
                     the aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
             (1) When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into
                     Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
             (2) A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or
                     rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
             (3) Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.

11.4 Failsafe Function

  The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote controller is lost. The flight control
  system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The
  following situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote controller and enter Failsafe
  mode:
  (1) The remote controller is powered off.
  (2) The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote controller.
  (3) There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote controller and the aircraft, essentially

      reducing the distance the signal can travel.
  (4) There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote controller.
Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing
  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during descent and landing process.
Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

Home Point
When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as the
home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being able to
fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Switching the S2 of remote controller from upper most position to its bottom most position will reset
the home point of Phantom 2 Vision. Definition of "home point" is i) where the Phantom 2 Vision return
to when control signal is lost ii) the home position which is used to calculate the horizontal distance
between you and the aircraft which is displayed on your cell phone app. When the home point is set,
you will see a very short period of fast green light flashing on the LED Flight Indicator.

11.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

  The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it
  appears, users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 VISION has two
  levels of low battery capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the
  second when it has less than 15%.
  When battery power drops below 30% an LED indicator will blink red slowly and an alert will show on the DJI
  VISION app; refer to the <DJI VISION app Low Battery Capacity Warning>. At lower than 15% the LED indicator
  will blink red rapidly and the DJI VISION app will sound an alarm; refer to the <DJI VISION app Low Battery
  Capacity Warning>. The PHANTOM 2 VISION will also begin to descend and land automatically. After it has
  landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC; refer to <Starting the Motors>.
  If you push the throttle stick above the mid-point, the PHANTOM 2 VISION will ascend slowly. Use the throttle,
  pitch, roll and yaw sticks normally to find a more appropriate landing area if required.
  There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V as
  its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
  Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pulling up on the throttle.)

DJI VISION App Low Battery Capacity Warning
DJI VISION App will show low battery capacity warnings.
(1) A red rectangle will blink on the camera screen.
(2) Audible alarm. Make sure the sound is turned on and volume is turned up on your mobile device.
(3) The aircraft battery icon will turn red.

                                                     Low Battery Capacity Warning
             Refer to the <DJI VISION App Usage> for details.
             (1) Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 VISION back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             (2) The PHANTOM 2 VISION is "Ready To Fly," "Ready to Capture" and "Ready to Share" but it is still

                  an aircraft. Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust
                  may cause a communication failure.

14 TroubleshootingFAQ

14.1 How to solve large margin(s) mid-point error?

If the Remote Controller stick(s) mid-point margin of error is too big, the motors will fail to start when you execute
the Combination Stick Commands (CSC) and the aircraft will not take off. Below are possible situations where the
Remote Controller's stick(s) mid-point margins of error could be too big:
(1) One of the Remote Controller's stick position (except the throttle stick) is not centered when powering on the
PHANTOM 2 VISION.
Solution: Place all Remote Controller sticks at their mid-point positions and then power cycle the PHANTOM 2
VISION to re-record the mid-point. If the problem persists, this can be caused by scenario (2).
(2) The Remote Controller sticks have been trimmed which leads to a large deviation of the mid-point position.
Solution: Use the Assistant Software to perform a Remote Controller calibration. To do so, carry out the following
procedures.

    (a) Connect to the Assistant software, tap Basic-> RC-> Command Sticks Calibration, and push all Remote
    Controller sticks through their complete travel range to see if any stick cannot reach its outer most position.
    (b) Power cycle the PHANTOM 2 VISION. Note that a power cycle is required.
    (c) Redo the Remote Controller calibration according to the Assistant software.
If the above solutions do not solve your issue, please send your Remote Controller to DJI Customer service for
repair.

14.2 How to restore a video file if power is turned off during a recording session?

Solution: Keep or place the Micro-SD card back into the camera. Power cycle the camera and wait about 30
seconds for the video file to be restored.

14.3 Failure to acquire the SSID.

Solution: Double check whether both the camera and Range Extender are powered on and the power switch of the
camera is switched to "WIFI ON."

14.4 What to do if PHANTOM 2 VISION is out of sight and the Wi-Fi connections is lost?

Solution: Turn off the Remote Controller to trigger the Failsafe mode and the aircraft will start to fly back, descend,
and land at the Home point automatically. Please make sure there are no obstacles within the go home route and
you are familiar with the regaining control procedure.

14.5 Wi-Fi connection fails all the time.

Solution: Double check the current Wi-Fi connection status of the mobile device. The mobile device may be
connecting to other Wi-Fi networks after a connection breaks with the PHANTOM 2 VISION.

©2013 DJI Innovations. All Rights Reserved. 52 |
14.6 Files fail to synchronize.

Solution: Video files that are too large (file sizes close to 4GB) cannot be synchronized to the mobile device. Some
mobile devices also fail to support synchronization of the 1080i60 video files.

14.7 Albums fail to synchronize.

Solution: Reset the settings of your mobile device as illustrated below. Enable the Settings ->Private->Photos->DJI
VISION. Otherwise the Albums will fail to synchronize with your mobile device.

14.8 Failure to share.

Solution: Please make sure the mobile device has access to the Internet.

14.9 Some mobile Android devices have a problem connecting to the PHANTOM 2 VISION
Wi-Fi Extender.

Solution: Some mobile Android devices do not allow for both a Wi-Fi connection and a mobile data connection at
the same time. When trying to connect to the PHANTOM 2 VISION Wi-Fi network, most devices will check whether
an Internet connection has a certain Wi-Fi setting enabled, e.g. Auto network switch or Test for Internet connection.
If no Internet connection is found because the PHANTOM 2 VISION creates a non-routable connection it will drop
the PHANTOM 2 VISION Wi-Fi network connection and scan for the next available connection. Example: For the
Samsung Note 3, carry out the following procedures to solve this issue. Tap Settings -> Wi-Fi, and then tap the
"Menu" button. Select "Advanced" then uncheck the "Auto network switch". You might see a warning that indicates
the Internet connection is unstable but just ignore this message.

14.10 Usage tips for the App used on multiple mobile devices.

During flight, if you use the App on multiple mobile devices, please turn off the App on the first mobile device, and
then turn on the App on the second one to ensure the App can work normally on the second mobile device.

14.11 How to land the aircraft smoothly in a better way?

First pull the throttle stick position down to lower than 5%, then execute the CSC command to stop the motors.

14.12 Why the discharge times of a new battery not at zero?

A battery aging test is performed prior to delivery which affects the discharge time of the new battery. This is why
the discharge time of a new battery is not zero. The battery is okay to use.

Cautions

When flying, the rotating propellers may cause serious damage and injury. Please fly safe at all times.

 Assembly Cautions

  1. Use a bracket to mount the GPS module on the center frame to avoid interference with the power board.
  2. Ensure the IMU is mounted with the arrow pointing toward the nose of the aircraft.
  3. If using a receiver, attach it under the bottom board of the center frame with the end of the antenna

     facing downwards and away from obstructions to avoid signal loss.
  4. Ensure frame arms are mounted correctly.

      a) Motor mounts with CCW marks should be mounted to the center frame positions with the following
           marks: M1, M3 and M5.

      b) Motor mounts with CW marks should be mounted to the center frame positions with the following
          marks: M2, M4, and M6.

 5. Do not remove any glued-in screws.
 6. Screws that already have blue glue can be used once without thread locker. On other occasions, apply

     appropriate thread locker first.
 7. The S900 should be lifted off the ground when testing landing gear or recalibrating servo travel.

Flight Cautions

1. ESCs are not water-proof, please do not fly in rain or snow.
2. Ensure all soft dampers and vibration absorbers are in good condition before every flight. If not, replace

   immediately. Otherwise, the flight performance of your aircraft will be adversely affected.
3. Ensure all parts are in good condition before each flight. Do not fly with worn or broken parts.
4. Ensure propellers and motors are installed correctly and propellers are unfolded before flying.
5. Ensure ESC signal connectors and power cable connectors are tight before every flight.
6. When flying, maintain a safe distance away from people, buildings, high -voltage lines, tall trees, water

   and other hazards.
7. Use only 6S LiPo batteries for the power supply.
8. Ensure all output signals from M1 to M6 are in proper working order when using the DJI A2 flight control

   system to avoid damage or injury.
9. Do not overload the system.
10. Do not get close to or touch motors or propellers when they are spinning as this can cause serious injury.
11. Disconnect the battery and remove the camera during transportation to avoid damage or injury.
12. We strongly recommend using as many DJI manufactured parts as possible.

Others

     If you have any problems you cannot resolve, contact your dealer or DJI customer service.

Installing Battery

Soldering battery connectors

AS150 spark-proof connectors are used. They must be soldered to your battery power cables.
1. Remove the original battery connectors. Avoid cutting the power and ground cables at the same time, as

    this can cause a short circuit. We recommend wrapping unsoldered cables with insulating tape to prevent
    accidental connections.
2. Pass the black ground wire through the black housing. After passing the wire through, solder the female
   bullet connector to the ground wire. Wait for the soldered connection to cool, then pull the housing back
    over the bullet connector.
3. Screw and pass the red power wire through the red housing. After passing the wire through, solder the
    male bullet connector to the power wire. Wait for the soldered connection to cool, and then screw and pull
    the housing back over the bullet connector.

Setting Up the Landing Gear

Using a 2- position RC transmitter switch, landing gear retraction can be carried out remotely.
   Setting up the transmitter
   Select a 2- position switch (default setting is OK) as the control input for the landing gear. Ensure the
   corresponding receiver port is connected to the "IN" port on control board. For the A2 flight control
   system, connect the flight controller's F1 port to IN port on control board.

                    Cr Upper: Toggle the switch to this position to raise the landing gear.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

                                           Lower: Toggle the switch to this position to lower the landing gear.

             If the transmitter switch has a FailSafe function, set the FailSafe value to the [Lower] position. This
            ensures that the landing gear will lower automatically when the receiver enters FailSafe mode.
            To avoid accidental switch triggering, slide levers or other controls can be used for landing gear
             control.

Usage procedures

1. Ensure transmitter and receiver batteries are fully charged.
2. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position, and then turn on the transmitter.
3. Ensure the "R ", "L" and "IN" connections are correct.
4. Ensure the landing gear is in the [Lower] position. then power on the system. If a solid green LED on the

    landing gear control board lights up, everything is normal. If it flashes green slowly, re-calibrate the system
    according to instructions in "Recalibrating Servo Travel ".
5. Toggle the switch to the [Upper] position ONLY AFTER takeoff.
6. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position for landing.

:01 Servo power will shut off 3 seconds after the landing gear has reached its target position.
          When powering on the system, if the transmitter switch is in the [Upper] position, the LED will flash
          red quickly as a warning. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position to continue.
           If there is an abnormal signal or no signal input into the IN port. the LED will slowly flash red.
          Check receiver and connections for problems.
          If servo power consumption is too high, the LED will light up red. If this lasts more than 4 seconds,
          the landing gear will lower and the LED will flash green slowly. Re-calibration is needed before
           flying.

       Remounting the Propellers

       Instructions

         1. Use two Max 12.3 screws and four washers to remount propellers.
        2. Apply thread locker to the thread of the propellers mount first.
        3. Affix screws with 4Kg cm (0.4N m) torque.

D Refer to original screw tensions if you are unfamiliar with torque measurements. Applying thread
                  locker to the propeller mount first avoids getting thread locker into the holes of the plastic propeller.

    A Loose screws cannot be securely locked with thread locker.

                                                                                                                                             R

 Propeller Precautions

Torque markers on the screws and propeller covers will give you a visual cue to check whether the propellers
are loose. Check the torque markers before every flight.

Using the Propeller Holder                                 2. Attach the propeller holder to the frame arm.

Instructions

1. Insert the propeller blades into the propeller holder.

Assembling Motor Vibration Absorbers

A soft damper is part of the vibration absorber. Assemble soft dampers as shown below. Assembly is the
same for CCW and CW propellers.

Ensure all soft dampers and vibration absorbers are in good condition before every flight. If not,
replace immediately. Otherwise, the flight performance of your aircraft will be adversely affected.
Before installing the soft dampers, put the copper gaskets onto the four mounting holes on the
carbon plate. Then put the soft dampers into the mounting holes.
After tightening the screws, the vibration absorbers may be twisted. If this is the case, hold the
motor with your thumbs under the base plate and fingers on the top carbon plate, and squeeze the
plates together to make the vibration absorbers flat and parallel with the plates.

 Recalibrating Servo Travel

Instructions

1. Keep your hands away from all moving parts.
2. Ensure the "R ", "L" and "IN" connections are correct.
3. Keep the whole aircraft off of the ground during calibration, as landing gear will move.
4. Press and hold the SET button using a pin while powering on, then release. An LED will flash yellow

    quickly. Press the SET button again. Auto calibration will begin and the LED will flash yellow slowly. DO
    NOT obstruct any moving parts during auto calibration.
5. During calibration, the left landing gear will raise and lower, followed by the right landing gear.
6. After calibration, both the left and right landing gears will be lowered and the LED will display a solid green
    light. This indicates that the landing gear is working properly.

/t\ If the LED is solid yellow after calibration, a problem has occurred. Carry out the instructions in

            "Remounting the Landing Gear Servo" then try again.
            Avoid obstructions during calibration. If the landing gear was obstructed, recalibration will be
            required, per the above steps.
            If the "R" and "L" servo cables are reversed. travel will not be measured correctly. Fix the
            connections and recalibrate the landing gear using the above steps.
            Landing gear travel has been pre -calibrated. Mechanical adjustment of the gear travel is not
            recommended.
