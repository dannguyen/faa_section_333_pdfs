                                                           Exemption No. 12538
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-1523

Mr. Rocky Babcock
1506 Providence Cove Court
Byron Center, MI 49315

Dear Mr. Babcock:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters posted to the public docket on May 8, July 2, and July 16, 2015, you petitioned the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate
an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography, videography, and
surveying.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Rocky Babcock is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Rocky Babcock is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
    weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

Washington, DC 20591

Dear Exemption Manager,

In reference to docket number FAA-2015-1523. It has been brought to my attention that there has bene
a request for additional information posted under ID FAA-2015-1523-0002. This letter requested the
following additional information:

    - The reasons why granting the request would be in the public interest; that is, how it would
         benefit the public as a whole.

    - The reasons why the exemption would not adversely affect safety or how the exemption would
         provide a level of safety at least equal to that provided by the rule form which you seek
         exemption.

    - Any additional information, views, or arguments available to support your request.

Section 1: The reasons why granting the request would be in the public interest and how it would
benefit the public as a whole.

         Granting this request for exemption would further communicate the importance of UAS safety
throughout the general public. While many hobbyists do not have plans for safety nor do they know the
rules of airspace governed by the FAA there is a need to grant exemptions to individuals, such as myself,
who plan to strictly adhere to all rulemaking procedures set forth by the FAA and follow these rules. I
plan to understand any and all rules as it pertains to the hobby and my particular aircraft.

         For example, an amateur photographer or videographer may be approached to take video or
pictures for events such as sporting events, races, or simply for a new vantage point a business would
like to show to the public without knowing the rulings for this procedures necessary for safe operation. I
intend to operate my UAS in a safe manner as previously described in the original docket and promote
the safe flying of a UAS for commercial use as I plan to use the UAS for monetary compensation for
individuals or businesses looking to get pictures which include but are not limited to; pictures of their
business, pictures of land, or pictures of any operations being performed.

         This operation also includes any videography that will be performed for compensation in order
to promote a brand or survey operations such as a work zone or construction project with new products
which companies seek to promote. This may also include aerial videography, which companies choose
to promote action sports with the strict consideration of using my particular UAS and how it will
operate.
Section 2: The reasons why the exemption would not adversely affect safety or how the exemption
would provide a level of safety at least equal to that provided by the rule form which you seek
exemption.

         Granting exemption would not adversely affect safety of individuals, wildlife or other structures.
The UAS will remain clear of all objects and structures as well as persons by obtaining a minimum range
of safety from the FAA or otherwise specifically requesting written consent for a person or structure to
be within the safe operating range of the UAS. Additionally any necessary barriers or buffers will be in
place in order to ensure safe operating distances are met by the UAS operator (Rocky Babcock). This
does not include closed set filming or photography but will pertain to recreational areas or private land
or public areas as requested by an individual or business.

         As previously stated, recreational hobbyists that attempt to provide services like this may not
have required documentation or the necessary pre-flight checklist as well as knowledge of the rules set
forth by the FAA. In order to maximize safety all FAA rules will pertain to any and all UAS operations
performed by myself via the DJI Inspire 1 aircraft. I seek to find the right rules and guidelines to safely
operate the Inspire 1 in a manner appropriate for any weather conditions or terrain in order to provide
the safety of any standing structures or people in the surrounding area.

Section 3: Any additional information, views, or arguments available to support your request.

         As a recreational hobbyist of 5 years in the radio controlled industry, I have a working
knowledge of various parts, systems, and necessary safety knowledge for the operation of the Inspire 1
for commercial use. I began flying small helicopters and progressed to larger, acrobatic helicopters that
I continue to use to this day. This began my interest in these hobbies and much of my personal life
involves repairing, operating and troubleshooting various small to mid-size helicopters strictly for
recreational use.

         Upon receiving the gift of the DJI Inspire 1 I have been approached by various individuals
interested in any services I may provide with the UAS but I have turned down all inquiries as they would
not be considered recreational and would fall under the commercial use category.

         As far as safety is concerned, I am currently a large part, in my professional career, in charge of
the safety operations of my current company as well as my previous company. I have been in the safety
regulation side of daily operations of various companies coming on to 4 years now, and understand the
importance of safety as it pertains to any commercial situation. I do possess a knowledge and
inclination to act within safety guidelines as I understand how disastrous not following any particular
procedure may be.

         The primary reason for my request for exemption doe include safety. I have been approached
to gather information, video and pictures of a traffic control work zone. There is a style of sheeting
called `Diamond Grade' sheeting for traffic drums seen in construction zones. The Michigan Department
of Transportation is interested in making this sheeting, which is the highest reflectivity you can get for
this type of product, a requirement for all road construction projects. The company that wants this
information wants to show a work area where this sheeting is being used and draw comparisons to
show how much more visible this sheeting is to motorists than current sheeting required by the MDOT.
This is not something that will be provided by myself until I have the required exemption to do so.
These operations would not include any flight over any passing vehicles but would be performed any
required distance away from people, vehicles and other structures which the Inspire 1 could cause
harm.

         Additionally I have been approached to provide videography and photography services for
companies in order to take pictures of their inventory contained in their outdoor, enclosed yard areas.
With these particular instances in mind I would like to gain exemption in order to offer my services for
compensation as requested by companies or individuals.

         I do seek to be as safe as possible in my operations and do understand the rules of the airspace.
I intend to be a hobbyist (currently) that exemplifies a working knowledge of commercial use of the UAS
and provide services in a safe and professional manner while adhering to the rules of the FAA.

         I thank you for your consideration and look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

Rocky Babcock
Rocky Babcock seeks relief from the following specific sections of Title 14 of the Code of
Federal Regulation:

         61.23
         Medical Certificates: Requirement and duration

         61.101(e)(4) and (5)
         Recreational pilot privileges and limitations

         61.113(a)
         Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in Command

         61.315(a)
         What are the privileges and limitations of my sport pilot certificate?

         91.7(a)
         Civil aircraft airworthiness

         91.119(c)
         Minimum safe altitudes: General

         91.121
         Altimeter settings.

         91.151(a)(1)
         Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

         91.405(a)
         Maintenance required.

         91.407(a)(1)
         Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration.

         91.409(a)(1) and (2)
         Inspections

         91.417(a) and (b)
         Maintenance records.

Rocky Babcock submits this request in accordance with the Reform Act, 112 P.L. 95 §§ 331-
334 pursuing abatement from any current applicable FARS operating before me. I do intend to
use the UAS for compensation for areal photogrophy, videogrphay and surveying provided for
intended individuals or groups that wish to utilize my services.
The Inspire 1 meets the classification requirements in the Reform Act in Section 332 pertaining
to civil unmaned aircraft in to national airspace. The Inspire 1 also meets the definition of `small
unmanned aircraft' as defined in section 331.
Public Interest

Please also consider the public interest as it pertains to fuel emissions. Additionally the UAS runs on
battery power and does not emit fumes or run on gases are potentially harmful to the environment.
The operation of this UAS removes human exposure to these situations as it pertains to full size
helicopters that may be used for photography or videography. If a UAS such as the Inspire 1 does lose
control and crashes there is no flammable gas that may explode.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be obtained by the operator per the Operator Manual and User Guide.
A data log will supplement safety along with automatic tracking of flight time and distances to gauge
when maintenance will be required. The operator will make sure all systems are functioning properly
prior to all flights.

If any issues arise the UAS will immediately land where it is able to do so safely. The ability to land in
otherwise difficult or impossible areas where a helicopter may be unable to land will create less risk
than a traditional rotorcraft which performs the same operation.
