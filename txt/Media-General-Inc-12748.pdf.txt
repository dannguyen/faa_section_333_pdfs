                                                           Exemption No. 12748
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2531

Ms. M. Anne Swanson
Cooley LLP
Counsel for Media General Inc.
1299 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Suite 700
Washington, DC 20004

Dear Ms. Swanson:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters dated June 3 and June 25, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on behalf of Media General, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
videography, data collection, and closed-set filming for motion picture and television.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C.  44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1 and closed set motion picture and
filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described
by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Media General, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR ㎣ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection
and closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to the conditions and
limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Media General, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
         weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
         aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR  61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR  61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR  91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR  1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR ㎣ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

RE: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and
      Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations

Dear Sir or Madam :

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the "Reform Act")
and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Media General , Inc. ("Media General") seeks an exemption from the
Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed below and discussed in Appendix A. 1 Media
General seeks exemption from the listed FARs to allow its use of the DJI Inspire 1 in (i)
commercial aerial videography, including but not limited to , newsgathering and production of
content for airing on its stations, and (ii) aerial data collection, involving , but not limited to ,
review, inspection , assessment, and monitoring of industrial and other properties, so long as
those operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as
established by the FAA in an exemption granted under either Section 333 or Section 49 U.S.C.
 44701(f).

Media General will operate in conformity with the separately filed flight operations and aircraft
flight manuals. 2 In addition, the operating conditions and limitations set forth below are identical
to those in the exemption granted to Aeryon Labs, lnc. 3 The only material difference in this
request is a change in the aircraft that Media General proposes to use; however, the FAA has
granted other petitioners' exemption requests for use of the DJI Inspire 1 in various commercial

1 See Pub. Law 112-95, 126 Stat. 11,  333 (2012) .
2 Media General requests th at these manuals be maintained in confidence and not be placed in
the public docket or otherwise disclosed to the public. As the information contained in the
manuals includes trade secrets and commercial information that is confidential and not made
available to the public, it is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5.
U.S .C.  552(b) and 14 C.F .R. Part 11 . Should the FAA receive a request for access to these
manuals, we would request notification of such request prior to any action being taken by the
FAA, as it may relate to the request.

 uses 4 Because the DJI Inspire 1 specified in this request is the same craft as the ones already
 approved in Exemptions 11458 and 11463, and Media General will operate the aircraft in strict
compliance with the conditions in existing exemptions previously granted by the FAA, or as they
 may be amended, notice need not be provided in the Federal Register nor public comment
solicited.

Media General proposes to use a small , lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle ("UAV") - the DJI
Inspire 1 - to conduct aerial videography and aerial data collection, as noted above. For
instance, in using the DJI Inspire 1 to collect broadcast footage, Media General will be able to
provide its viewers with innovative programming and better coverage of events and issues of
importance to its local communities.

Operations under the exemption will be subject to strict operating requirements and conditions
to ensure at least an equivalent level of safety to currently authorized operations using manned
aircraft and under conditions as may be modified by the FAA as required by Section 333.
As described more fully below, the requested exemption would authorize commercial operations
using the DJI Inspire 1, which with a maximum take-off weight of 6.4 pounds is small in size.
The DJI Inspire 1 will be operated under controlled conditions at low altitude in airspace that is
limited in scope; it will have automated control features. The DJI Inspire 1 also will be operated
by an individual possessing a recreational or sport pilot certificate and a U.S. state issued
driver's license. Media General hereby requests a blanket COA for flights up to 200 feet above
ground level in the form approved by the FAA. Media General acknowledges that under current
FAA guidance, a separate Certificate of Waiver or Authorization ("COA") is required to fly at
altitudes above 200 feet above ground level , and it will apply for COAs when required . Media
General will also file Notices to Airmen for its flights, as required.
Media General respectfully submits that because this small, unmanned aerial vehicle - the DJI
Inspire 1 -will be used in lieu of comparatively hazardous operations now conducted with fixed
wing and rotary conventional aircraft, the FAA can have confidence that the operations will
achieve at least an equivalent level or greater level of safety. Approval of this exemption would
thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's)
responsibilities under Section 333(c) of the Reform Act to "establish requirements for the safe
operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system ."

Appendix A discusses each rule listed above and explains why exemptions pursuant to the
proposal set forth in this letter are appropriate, will provide an equivalent level of safety, and will
be in the public interest.

                      THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD UNDER SECTION 333

Media General submits that grant of this exemption application for commercial use of the DJI
Inspire 1 will advance the Congressional mandate in Section 333 of the Reform Act to
accelerate the introduction of unmanned aerial systems ("UASs") into the national airspace
system ("NAS") if it can be accomplished safely. This law directs the Secretary of
Transportation to consider whether certain UASs may operate safely in the NAS before
completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this
determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of UASs do not create a
hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security in light of the
following:

      The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
      Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
      Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.

Reform Act  333(a)(1). If the Secretary determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in
the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation
of such aircraft in the national airspace system ." /d.  333(c) (emphasis added).5

5 Applicant submits that this provision places a duty on the Administrator to not only process
applications for exemptions under Section 333, but for the Administrator, if he deems the
conditions proposed herein require modification to allow approval, to supply conditions for the
safe operation of the UAS. Media General welcomes the opportunity to consult with FAA staff in

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority, by its terms, includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under
 40101 of the Act, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current airworthiness
certificate and those regulations requiring commercial pilots to operate aircraft in commercial
service :

          The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation
          prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any of sections 44702-
          44716 of this title if the Administrator finds the exemption is in the public interest.

49 U.S.C.  44701 (f) . See also 49 U.S .C.  44711 (a); 49 U.S. C.  44704; 14 C.F.R.
 91 .203(a)(1) .

The grant of the requested exemption is in the public interest based on the clear direction in
Section 333 of the Reform Act; the additional authority in the Federal Aviation Act, as amended;
the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations ; and the significant
public benefit, including enhanced safety and cost savings associated with transitioning to UASs
for aerial videography and aerial data collection. Accordingly, the applicant respectfully
requests that the FAA grant the requested exemption without delay.6

                              AIRCRAFT AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

The applicant proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at
least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory
structure because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to operations that
would be conducted with conventional aircraft.

These limitations and conditions, which are drawn from the exemption granted to Aeryon Labs,
Exemption No. 11213, and to which Media General (or "operator") agrees to be bound when
conducting commercial operations, are as follows :

     1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
          weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
          aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this grant.

order to address any issues or concerns that this proposal may raise that they believe may
require modification.
6 In filing this application, Media General also is requesting that the FAA, as it has in recent
decisions, combine the grant of the Section 333 exemption with a stand-alone Certificate of
Operation ("COA") that will allow commercial operation of the DJI Inspire 1 without the necessity
of filing for a COA for each flight. Compliance with the conditions agreed to herein and those
that may be imposed by the FAA, as set forth in prior Section 333 exemptions, provide the
separation needed from other aircraft. Notice to airmen and notice to air traffic control can be
provided by the filing of a NOTAM as set forth within the proposed conditions.

     2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
           permitted .

     3. The UAS may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour).
           Media General may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
           compliance with the speed restriction. In no case will the UAS be operated at airspeeds
          greater than the maximum UAS operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft
           manufacturer, which in this case is 43 knots (49 miles per hour).

     4. The UAS must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
          (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

     5. The UAS must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times. This
          requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
          corrective lenses , as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
          U.S. driver's license.

     6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UAS must be operated within the
          visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used to satisfy
          the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability . The VO
          and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times . Electronic messaging or
          texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must be designated before the
          flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC
          must ensure that the VO can perform the duties required of the VO.

     7. The exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
          operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in the grant of
          exemption are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
          documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
          Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
          limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents , the
          conditions and limitations in the exemption take precedence and must be followed.
          Otherwise , the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
          documents.

          The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the operator's
          responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised documents to the
          Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The operator must also
          present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension or amendment to thi s
          grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or revision would affect
          the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the operator must petition for
          an amendment to its grant of exemption . The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80)
          may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the operating
          documents.

     8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
          or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo a
          functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
           Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
           least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such a
          manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

     9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is in
          a condition for safe operation.

     10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the UAS
          is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all potential
          discrepancies, e.g. , inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the inspection
          reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is prohibited
          from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the UAS is
          found to be in a condition for safe flight.

     11 . The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul , replacement ,
          inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft components .

     12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
          bulletins.

     13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either a recreational or sport pilot
          certificate . The PIC must also hold a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid
          U.S . driver's license issued by a state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, a territory , a
          possession , or the Federal government. The PIC must also meet the flight review
         requirements specified in 14 CFR  61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his
          or her pilot certificate.

     14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the ability
          to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
          under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and maintaining
          appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures. PIC qualification

         flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR 

          61 .51 (b) . Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs (training ,
          proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to safely operate
          the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated under this exemption
          are permitted under the terms of this exemption . However, training operations may only
          be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During training , proficiency, and
          experience-building flights, all persons not essential for flight operations are considered
          nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA with appropriate distance from
         nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR  91 .119.

    15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR  1.1 . All

          operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC) . Flights
          under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized .

     16. The UAS may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
          denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not denoted
          with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-published
          aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's management is
          obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption holder. The letter of
          agreement with the airport management must be made available to the Administrator or
          any law enforcement official upon request.

     17. The UAS may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
          horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

     18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UAS must return to a
          predetermined location within the private or controlled-access property.

     19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

     20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
          weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the intended
          operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve power
          recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

     21 . Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) . All
          operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The exemption
          holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct operations that
          cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

    22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
          number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
          (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
          as large as practicable.

    23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and

         any documents required under 14 CFR ㎣ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the PIC

          at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating . These
          documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
          upon request.

    24. The UAS must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
          activities at all times.

    25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

      26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
           persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:

                     a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating
           persons from the UAS and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must
           ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection . If a situation arises
           where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA,
           flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of
           nonparticipating persons ; and,

                     b. The owner/controller of any vessels , vehicles or structures has granted
           permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety
           assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does
           not present an undue hazard.

           The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered nonparticipating
           persons under this exemption.

     27 . All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
           permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative . Permission
          from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be obtained for each
          flight to be conducted.

     28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
          boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
          to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
          reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained
          on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

Privacy . All Media General UAS operations will be conducted in accordance with applicable
federal , state, or local laws regarding privacy.

National Security. No national security issue is raised by the grant of this exemption. G iven
the size , load carrying capacity, speed at which the DJI Inspire 1 operates , and the fact that it
carries no explosives or other dangerous materials, the UAS poses no threat to national
security.

Approval of this exemption for commercial operations will enhance safety by reducing risk.
Conventional operations, using jet or piston powered aircraft, operate at extremely low altitudes
just feet from the subject being inspected and in extreme proximity to people and structures.
Such manned operations present the risks associated with vehicles that weigh in excess of
6,000 lbs., carrying large amounts of jet A or other fuel. Such aircraft must fly to and from the
project location . In contrast, a small UAS ("sUAS") , like the DJI Inspire 1, which weighs fewer
than seven pounds. and is powered by batteries, eliminates virtually all of that risk given the
reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on board . The sUAS is carried to the target
area and not flown. The sUAS will carry no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose
such individuals to the risks associated with manned aircraft flights .

The operation of this small craft, weighing less than seven pounds, conducted in the strict
conditions outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the
exemptions requested herein. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds , close to the
ground , and in areas that are under the control of the operator. As a result, they are far safer
than would be conventional operations conducted with manned aircraft flying in close proximity
to the ground and people.

Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 - size , weight,
speed , operating capabilities , proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within
visual line of sight, and national security - provides more than adequate justification for the
grant of this requested exemption to allow commercial operation of applicant's UAS for the
purposes outlined herein. The grant will be consistent with exemptio.ns already granted.

EXEMPTION REQUEST AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY DEMONSTRATION UNDER
                               APPLICABLE RULES SUBJECT TO EXEMPTION

Media General requests an exemption from the following regulations as well as any additional
regulations that may technically apply to its operation of the OJI Inspire 1:

14 C.F.R.  61.23(a) and (c): Medical Certificates: Requirement and Duration

Sections 61.23(a) and (c) address the requirement of medical certificates for pilots. Section
61 .23(a) requires a person exercising the privileges of a recreational pilot to hold at least a third
class medical certificate. Section 61.23(c) permits the holder of a sport pilot certificate to act as
PIC of a light-sport aircraft with either a medical certificate or U.S. issued driver's license. Light-
sport aircraft may weigh up to 1,430 pounds and seat up to two persons, including the pilot.
Comparatively, the DJI Inspire 1 will weigh fewer than seven pounds, and it will not carry pilots,
passengers, or cargo. The UAS will also be operated within visual line of sight of the PIC and
below 400 feet above ground level and limited to operations with permission over private or
controlled-access property.

Given these safety parameters , Media General requests that the FAA waive Section 61.23(a)
upon a finding that an equivalent level of safety will be provided by allowing operation of the OJI
Inspire 1 by pilots with a recreational or sport pilot certificate and a valid U.S. state issued
driver's license, in lieu of an FAA-issued medical certificate. Media General also requests that
the FAA grant relief from Section 61.23(c) to allow sport pilot certificate holders to operate
aircraft other than light-sport aircraft with a valid U.S. issued driver's license. The FAA has
granted exemptions to conduct similar operations in a number of cases, including Exemption
11213.

14 C.F.R.  61.101 (e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), and 61.315(a): Recreational Pilot Privileges
and Limitations; Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command; What are the
privileges and limits of my sport pilot certificate?

Sections 61.101 (e)(4) and (5) and 61.113(a) limit recreational or private pilots to non-
commercial operations. Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries a pilot, passengers, and
cargo, the DJI Inspire 1 in this case is remotely controlled with no passengers or property of
others on board . Section 61.315(a) addresses the privileges and limitations of the holder of a
sport pilot certificate.

Media General respectfully proposes that operator requirements should take into account the
characteristics of the particular UAS. The OJI Inspire 1 has a high degree of pre-programmed
control and various built-in navigation and other technical capabilities that strictly limit the
potential for operation outside of the operating conditions set forth in the exemption application .
Flights are pre-programmed with precision GPS guidance and do not require human
intervention. In the case of unplanned events, the operator can manually intervene to take one
of the following actions: (i) command the aircraft to begin to autonomously return to the
Cooley

U.S. Department of Transportation
June 3, 2015
Page Two

recovery area and land ; (ii) command the aircraft to autonomously return to the recovery area
where the pilot will assume control and land the aircraft; or (iii) manually assume control of the
aircraft via the hand controller and return the craft to the recovery area where the operator lands
it.

Additional automated safety functions and safety enhancing features of the DJI Inspire 1 include
the following :

      Low battery power on the aircraft triggers the landing sequence, and the craft will fly to
          the recovery area.

      If the auto-pilot detects a lost-link to the ground control station for longer than three
          seconds, landing procedure begins.

      In the event the ground station reaches a low power state, it will alert the pilot.

Given these safety features , operators of the OJI Inspire 1 should not be required to hold a
commercial pilot certification . Instead, operators should be required to hold only a recreational
or sport pilot certificate.

The risks associated with the operation of the OJI Inspire 1 (given its size, speed , operational
capabilities, and lack of combustible fuel) are so diminished from the level of risk associated
with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 with conventional aircraft (fixed wing or
rotorcraft) that allowing operations of the UAS as set forth above meets or exceeds the present
level of safety provided under the regulations cited above and does not rise to the level of
requiring a commercial pilot to operate the aircraft.

Given these conditions and restrictions, an equivalent level of safety will be provided by allowing
operation of the OJI Inspire 1 with a recreational or sports pilot certificate, under the conditions
set forth in the exemption request. The FAA has granted exemptions to conduct similar
operations in a number of cases, including Exemption 11213.

14 C.F.R.  91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness.

This regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. Should the exemption be granted allowing commercial operation of the OJI Inspire 1
without an airworthiness certificate , no standard will exist for airworthiness of the OJI Inspire 1.
Given the size of the aircraft and the requirements to which the operator has agreed relating to
airworthiness, as set forth in the attached manuals, an equivalent level of safety will be achieved
by ensuring compliance with the Media General manuals prior to each flight. The FAA has
granted exemptions to conduct similar operations in Exemptions 11062 through 11067, 11080,
11109, 11110, 11136, 11138, and 11213.

14 C.F.R.  91.119(c): Minimum Safe Altitudes.

Section 91 .119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Specifically, 91 .119(c)
limits aircraft flying over areas other than congested areas to an altitude of 500 feet above the

surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases , the aircraft may
not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person , vessel , vehicle , or structure.

As set forth herein , the DJI Inspire 1 will never operate at higher than 400 feet AGL . It will,
however, be operated to avoid congested or populated areas. Because aerial videography work
must be accomplished at relatively low altitudes and at altitudes less than 500 feet AGL , an
exemption from Section 91 .119(c) is needed.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed, and material with
which the DJI Inspire 1 is built. Also, no flight will be taken without the permission of the
landowner or those who control the land as well as the permission of local officials , if required .
Because of advance notice to the landowner, all affected individuals will be aware of the flights .
Compared to commercial operations, such as aerial videography or aerial data collection,
conducted with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than seven pounds. and carrying
flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations will be far less than the risks currently
posed by conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 feet AGL. Indeed , the low-altitude
operations of the UAS will maintain separation between these sUAS operations and the
operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91 .119. The FAA has granted
exemptions to conduct similar operations in Exemptions 11062 through 11067, 11080, 11110,
11136, 11138, 11150, 11153, and 11213.

14 C.F.R.  91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

This regulation prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under VFR
conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly
to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed- (1) During the day,
to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes. "

The batteries powering the DJI Inspire 1 provide approximately 18 minutes of powered flight.
Without an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91 .151, the UAS's flights would not be possible. Given
the limitations on its proposed operations and the location of those proposed operations, a
longer time frame for flight in daylight VFR conditions is reasonable.

Media General believes that an exemption from 14 C.F.R.  91.151(a) is safe and within the
scope of prior exemptions. See Exemption 11213. Operating the small UAS without
30 minutes of reserve fuel does not engender the type of risks that Section 91 .151 (a) was
meant to prevent given the size and speed at which the UAS operates. The fact that it carries
no pilot, passenger, or cargo also enhances its safety. In the unlikely event that the DJI Inspire
1 achieves a low battery state, it would simply return to home and land . Given its weight and
construction material, the risks are less than contemplated by the current regulation .

Media General believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by maintaining
five minutes of reserve fuel, which, allowing 13 minutes of flight time , would be more than
adequate to return the UAS to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its operating area.

Similar exemptions have been granted to other operators, including Exemptions 11062 through
11067, 11080, 11109, 11110, 11112, 11136, 11138, 11150, 11153, and 11213.

14 C.F.R.  91.405(a); 407(a)(1); 409(a)(2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections
Section 91.405(a) requires that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected
as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of
this chapter ... ." Section 91.407 similarly makes reference to requirements in Part 43;
Section 91.409(a)(2) requires an annual inspection for the issuance of an airworthiness
certificate. Section 91.417(a) requires the owner or operator to keep records showing certain
maintenance work that has been accomplished by certificated mechanics, under Part 43, or
licensed pilots and records of approval of the aircraft for return to service.
Maintenance of the OJI Inspire 1 will be accomplished by the owner/operator pursuant to the
manuals separately filed as confidential exhibits. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved
because the UAS is small in size, will carry a small payload , will operate only in restricted
predetermined areas, and is not a complex mechanical device. As provided in the confidential
manuals, the operator will ensure that the UAS is in working order prior to initiating flight,
perform required maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance that is performed; moreover,
the operator is the person most familiar with the aircraft and is best suited to maintain the
aircraft in an airworthy condition and to ensure an equivalent level of safety. The FAA has
granted exemptions for similar operations in Exemptions 11062 through 11067, 11080, 11109,
11110, 11112,11136,11138, and 11213.
