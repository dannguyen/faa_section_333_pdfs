                                                           Exemption No. 12415
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­2199

Mr. James J. Guidici
19 Sugar Maple Court
Lake in the Hills, IL 60156

Dear Mr. Guidici:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 20, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial data collection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
                                                                                                                 2

14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. James J. Guidici is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. James J. Guidici is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.

Re: Summary Exemption Request under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of
the Federal Aviation Regulations from certain parts of the FARs.

Dear Administrator Huerta:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act)
and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, James J. Guidici (or the "Petitioner"), hereby applies for a summary
exemption from the listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow him to operate small
Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("UAS") for aerial data collection, under the conditions and
limitations set forth in this Petition.

The requested exemption would permit the operation of small, unmanned and relatively
inexpensive UAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is (1) limited, (2) predetermined,
and (3) would provide safety enhancements to the already safe news gathering operations
presently using manned helicopters and airplanes. Approval of this exemption would thereby
enhance safety and fulfill the FAA Administrator's responsibilities to "...establish requirements
for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system." Section 333(c)
of the Reform Act.

The Appendix describes the FARs from which an exemption is requested and summarizes the
justification for each requested exemption.

The Petition is submitted to fulfill Congress' goal under Section 333(a) through (c) of the
Reform Act, which directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether certain
unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before
completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this
determination, the Administrator must determine which types of UASs do not create a hazard
to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security in light of the following:

· The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
· Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
· Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.

Reform Act § 333 (a).

If the Adminstrator determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the national airspace
system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft in the
national airspace system." Id. § 333(c) (emphasis added). The Secretary has delegated his
aviation authority to the Administrator of the FAA. The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants
the FAA the authority to grant exemptions from its regulatory requirements for civil aircraft, a
term defined under §40101 of the Act, which includes sUASs. The Administrator may grant an
exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this
section or any sections 44702-44716 of the Federal Aviation Act if Administrator finds the
exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. § 44701(f) See also 49 USC § 44711(a); 49 USC §
44704; 14 CFR §91.203 (a) (1).
Summary of Request:

As a long time radio control pilot, I am requesting an exception, and permission to use my UAS,
DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ (further in this report are the detailed specifications of the UAS), for the
purpose of taking aerial photos and videos for the home real estate business, and for commercial
businesses real estate property in the suburbs of the greater Chicago area. This is a technology that
is perfect for realtors to help the potential home buyer get a better perspective of the home and
neighborhood they are considering. This is important in the rural and suburban areas, where the
homes typically have a larger piece of real estate, with mature landscaping, large trees, and perhaps
heavily wooded. Their view of the property will be greatly enhanced, providing for a perspective
never before seen. For the commercial business owner, it helps them show a complete view of
perhaps acres of their property for TV/Internet commercials, and /or on their websites, ie: auto
dealers, enhancing their growth opportunities. I am also planning to purchase a DJI Inspire 1 this
summer. This UAS is similar in many ways to the DJI Phantom Vision 2+. The differences are
that is has an enhanced camera with 4K filming capability, it has landing gear that retracts, and its
weight is 6.5 lbs. (the specs for this UAS are also included).

Why the exemption would not adversely affect safety:

This can be done very safely in a controlled environment, on private property, with limited airtime
required, extremely low noise, in uncongested areas. The UAS will always be operated in a Visual
Line of Sight (VLOS) environment, with an observer, and always under 400 feet.

Description of UAS:

The DJI Phantom Vision 2+ (UAS) operates on 5.8 GHz, and weighs 2.7 pounds. Serial #
BF1613340486263. It has a very sophisticated flight control system (DJI NAZA­M V2), and
includes a Gyro, Compass, GPS, and camera that is on a three axis gimbal. The flight system
includes a "Failsafe" function, where if signal is lost, or interference occurs with the controller, or
it fly's out of range, the UAS will automatically return to its "home" position. It also provides
altitude & radius flight adjustment settings, for maximum height and distance.

It will also "altitude hold- auto hover" if radio control sticks are released. And, in order to increase
flight safety and prevent accidental flights in restricted areas, the new firmware for the Phantom 2
series includes a "No Fly Zone" feature. These zones have been divided into two categories: A -
large international airports and, B - small local airports. http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category

Exceeding the control range of the remote control will trigger `Return-to-Home', meaning the
Phantom 2 Vision+ will automatically fly back to its takeoff point and land safely.

Using Wi-Fi and a Wi-Fi Range Extender, the camera transmits live video to my Apple iPhone 6 or
iPad Mini 2, all of which comply with FCC requirements. The DJI Vision App shows, altitude,
direction of flight, distance from home, speed, location, number of satellites acquired, and battery
level.

Pilot in Command (PIC) Background and experience:

I have 30 years experience in flying radio control UAS aircraft, and have been flying radio
control airplanes since the mid 80's. My current inventory totals 30 electric aircraft, including
fixed wing prop planes, mostly WWII war birds, EDF (electric ducted fan) jets, and multi-copters.
I am a Viet Nam veteran, USAF, and I am currently retired from the technology industry. I have
always been intrigued with any new technology, and generally have always been an early adopter.

I am a member of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, with a very good understanding of
aeronautics, and I have always been an extremely responsible UAS pilot. I am in great health.
Being retired, and on a fixed income, I would like to take advantage of my hobby skills, in a
commercial way, to help generate additional revenue for living expenses. I have been into video
and photography, as a hobby, my entire life. This new technology ties together, both of my long
time hobbies. I am currently in process of getting my Sport Pilot Certificate, and I hold a valid
drivers license from the State of Illinois.

Why the public would be served by granting this exemption:

I believe this is a technology that can benefit realtors and commercial businesses, in a huge way.
The industry is anxious to have this technology enhance their ability to market properties from a
totally new perspective, because the aerial perspective is very impressive. By increasing their
marketing potential it can increase home sales, benefiting Realtor, buyer and seller. That is a win,
win, win. For the commercial business owner, that new aerial perspective can increase market
awareness and growth, with greater recognition of business message, physical presence, inventory
(in the case of an auto dealer) and location.
The Petition to use a UAS for aerial data collection and its proposed limitations are similar in all
material respects to those approved by the FAA in Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), 11213 to
Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642) and 11310 to Colin Hinkle (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0608). In those grants the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an
unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the Petitioner and carrying no
passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew
in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by
this exemption is in the public interest.

The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, 11213, and
11310 also apply to the situation presented by this Petition.

Respectfully Submitted,

James J. Guidici
