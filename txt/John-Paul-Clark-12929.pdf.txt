                                                           Exemption No. 12929
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2642

Mr. John-Paul Clark
DBA UAV Xpressions
10322 Lyndon Meadows Drive
Houston, TX 77095

Dear Mr. Clark:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 11, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. You requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
inspections, photography, and videography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Inspire 1 and DJI Phantom 3.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
                                                                                           2

Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. John-Paul Clark is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. John-Paul Clark is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 and
         DJI Phantom 3 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
         permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners

BASIS  FOR  PETITION  

Petitioner,   John-Paul   Clark,   pursuant   to   the   provisions   of   the   Federal   Aviation   Regulations   (14  
C.F.R.  §  11.61)  and  the  FAA  Modernization  and  Reform  Act  of  2012  (FMRA),  Section  333,  Special  
Rules   for   Certain   Unmanned   Aircraft   Systems,   hereby   petitions   the   Administrator   to  
commercially   operate   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   in   the   National   Airspace   System   (NAS),   and   for   an  
exemption   from   the   requirements   of   14   C.F.R   §§   61.101(e)(4)   and   (5),   61.315(a),   61.23(a),  
91.7(a),  91.121,  91.151(b),  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(1),  91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  and  91.417(a)  &  (b).  
  
In   consideration   of   the   speed,   weight,   size,   and   limited   operating   area   associated   with   the  
unmanned  aircraft  and  its  operation,  John-Paul  Clark's  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  meets  the  conditions  of  
FMRA   Section   333   and   therefore,   will   not   require   an   airworthiness   certificate   in   accordance  
with  14  C.F.R.  Part  21,  Subpart  H.  
  
Accordingly,   John-Paul   Clark   requests   relief   from   Sections   91.405(a),   91.407(a)(1),   91.409(a)(1)  
&   (a)(2),   and   91.417(a)   &   (b),   as   these   sections   set   forth   requirements   for   maintenance   that  
only  apply  to  aircraft  with  an  airworthiness  certificate.  
  
John-Paul   Clark   submits   that   the   requested   relief   is   proper   since   an   equivalent   level   of   safety  
will   be   ensured.   John-Paul   Clark   will   use   experienced   personnel   or   technicians   to   perform  
maintenance,   alterations,   or   preventive   maintenance   on   the   UASs   using   the   methods,  
techniques,  and  practices  prescribed  in  the  operating  documents.    
  
Additionally,   John-Paul   Clark   requests   relief   from   the   requirements   of   Sections   45.11,   45.21,  
45.23,  45.25,  45.27,  45.29,  47.3(b)(2),    and  47.31(c)  since  the  FAA  currently  has  no  registration  
procedure  for  sUASs;  and  should  such  a  procedure  exist,  the  small  size  and  flight  characteristics  
of  the  UAS  prohibit  the  placement  of  placards  and  markings  per  the  specified  dimensions.  
  
Relief   from   certain   requirements   of   Section   61.101(e)(4)   and   (5)   entitled   Recreational   pilot  
privileges  and  limitations:  Pilot  in  command,  and  from  Section  61.315(a)  entitled  What  are  the  
privileges   and   limits   of   my   sport   pilot   certificate,   and   from   Section   61.23(a)   entitled   Medical  
certificates:  Requirements  and  duration,  is  requested  by  John-Paul  Clark  to  the  extent  necessary  
to   allow   a   Pilot   in   Command   (PIC)   holding   a   sport   pilot   or   higher   level   certificate,   as   well   as   a  
valid   driver's   license,   and   who   has   demonstrated,   by   meeting   minimum   flight-hour   and  
currency   requirements,   that   the   PIC   is   able   to   safely   operate   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   in   a   manner  
consistent   with   this   exemption,   including   evasive   and   emergency   maneuvers   and   maintaining  
appropriate  distances  from  people,  vessels,  vehicles  and  structures.  
  
John-Paul   Clark   seeks   relief   from   Section   91.7(a),   entitled   Civil   aircraft   airworthiness,   because  
the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  do  not  require  an  airworthiness  certificate  in  accordance  with  14  C.F.R.  Part  
21,  Subpart  H.  As  such,  John-Paul  Clark  submits  that  he  will  ensure  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  are  in  an  

                                                                4  
                                                                   
airworthy  condition,  prior  to  every  flight,  by  determining  that  the  UASs  are  in  compliance  with  
the  operating  documents  and  that  the  aircraft  are  in  a  condition  for  safe  flight.  
  
John-Paul   Clark   also   seeks   an   exemption   from   the   requirements   of   Section   91.121,   entitled  
Altimeter   Settings,   DJI   UAS   aircraft   will   not   have   a   typical   barometric   altimeter   onboard.  
However,   altitude   information   of   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   will   be   provided   to   the   PIC   via   Global  
Positioning   System   (GPS)   equipment   and   radio   communications   telemetry   data   link,   which  
downlinks   from   the   UA   to   the   GCS   for   active   monitoring   of   the   flight   path.   This   altitude  
information,  combined  with  John-Paul  Clark  operation  of  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  within  visual  line  
of  sight,  at  or  below  400  feet  AGL,  will  ensure  a  level  of  safety  equivalent  to  Section  91.121.  
  
Additionally,   John-Paul   Clark   seeks   an   exemption   from   the   requirements   of   Section   91.151(b),  
entitled   Fuel   requirements   for   flight   in   VFR   conditions.   John-Paul   Clark   submits   that   safety   will  
not   be   affected   by   operation   of   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   during   daylight   hours   in   visual  
meteorological  conditions  (VMC)  under  visual  flight  rules  (VFR),  with  enough  battery  power  to  
fly  for  a  total  duration  of  approximately  15  minutes  to  the  first  point  of  intended  landing  and,  
assuming  normal  cruising  speed,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  least  5  minutes.  
  
In   accordance   with   14   C.F.R.   §   11.81,   John-Paul   Clark   provides   the   following   information   in  
support  of  its  petition  for  exemption:

SPECIAL  EXEMPTION  REQUESTS  

Section    43.7  
         Relief   from   section   43.7   is   requested.      Given   the   sUAS   construction   characteristics,   all  
         inspections   will   be   done   as   recommended   by   the   manufacturer.   All   repairs   other   than  
         simple   propeller   changes   will   be   done   by   the   manufacturer   or   one   of   their   authorized  
         repair   centers.   Maintenance   will   be   performed   as   outlined   in   the   manufacturer's  
         maintenance  guidelines.  All  maintenance  and  repairs  will  meet  the  requirements  for  the  
         equivalent   level   of   safety   pursuant   to   section   33   given   the   intended   use   and   remote  
         location  of  the  sUAS.  

Section    43.11  
         Relief   from   section   43.11   is   requested.   Currently   the   FAA   has   not   certified   any  
         inspections   for   sUASs.      Furthermore,   due   to   the   size   of   the   sUAS,   no   room   exists   for  
         maintenance  placards.  Maintenance  records  will  be  kept  on  file  by  John-Paul  Clark.  

Section    45.11  
         Relief  from  section  45.11  entitled  Marking  of  products  is  requested.  Due  to  its  small  size  
         and   flight   characteristics,   fireproof   placards   would   cause   a   potential   hazard   to   the  
         aircraft  with  the  additional  weight  or  location.  

Section    45.21  
         Relief   from   section   CFR   45.21   entitled   General   is   requested.   The   FAA   currently   has   no  
         registration   procedures   for   sUASs   however   if   a   registration   number   can   be   assigned,  
         placement  on  the  aircraft  will  be  done  in  the  most  practical  and  visible  means  available.  

                                                                6  
                                                                   
Section  45.23  
         Relief  from  section  45.23  entitled  Display  of  marks  is  requested.  Due  to  the  small  size  of  
         the  sUAS,  full  size  aircraft  marks  are  not  feasible.  If  a  designation  is  assigned  by  the  FAA,  
         John-Paul   Clark   will   place   assigned   designation   marks   on   the   aircraft   in   the   most  
         practical  and  visible  manner  available.  

Section  45.25  
         Relief  from  section  45.25  entitled  Location  of  marks  on  fixed  wing  aircraft  is  requested.  
         The   sUAS   is   a   multi-rotor   aircraft   and   does   not   possess   fix   wings   and   as   such   14   CFR  
         45.25  is  inapplicable.  

Section  45.27  
         Relief   from   section   45.27   entitled   Location   of   marks   on   non-fixed   wing   aircraft   is  
         requested.  Due  to  the  sUASs  small  size  it  has  no  cabin,  fuselage,  boom,  or  tail.  

Section  45.29  
         Relief  from  section  45.29  entitled  Size  of  Marks  is  requested.    Due  to  size  constraints  of  
         the  aircraft,  this  requirement  cannot  be  met.    

Section  47.3(b)(2)  
         Relief  from  section  47.3(b)(2)  entitled  Registration  is  requested  since  the  FAA  currently  
         has  no  procedures  for  registration  of  a  sUAS.  

Section  47.31(c)  
         Relief   from   section   47.31(c)   entitled   Application   is   requested   since   compliance   for   14  
         CFR   47.31(c)   is   not   possible   since   the   FAA   does   not   yet   have   procedures   to   register  
         sUAS.  

Section  61.113(a)  And  (b)  
         Relief   from   Section   61.113(a)   and   (b)   entitled   Private   pilot   privileges   and   limitations:  
         Pilot   in   command,   is   requested   to   the   extent   necessary   to   allow   a   PIC   holding   a   sport  
         pilot  or  higher  level  certificate,  as  well  as  a  current  and  valid  airman  medical  certificate  
         or   a   valid   Texas   drivers   license,   and   who   has   met   certain   flight-hour   and   currency  
         requirements,  to  conduct  the  proposed  UAS  flight  operations  for  compensation  or  hire.  
           
         This   relief   is   requested   since   the   limitations   set   forth   in   Section   61.113(a)   and   (b)   state  
         that  a  private  pilot  may,  for  compensation  or  hire,  act  as  PIC  of  an  aircraft  in  connection  
         with  any  business  or  employment  if:  (1)  The  flight  is  only  incidental  to  that  business  or  
         employment;   and   (2)   The   aircraft   does   not   carry   passengers   or   property   for  
         compensation  or  hire.  
           

                                                                7  
                                                                   
         As  set  forth  more  fully  below,  John-Paul  Clark  submits  that  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  
         will   be   maintained   because   no   PIC   will   be   allowed   to   operate   the   DJI   Inspire   1   or   DJI  
         Phantom  3  UAS  unless  that  PIC  has  met  certain  flight-hour  and  currency  requirements,  
         demonstrating   that   the   PIC   is   able   to   safely   operate   either   the   DJI   Inspire   1   or   DJI  
         Phantom   3   UAS   in   a   manner   consistent   with   the   operations   specifications   as   described  
         in   this   exemption,   including   evasive   and   emergency   maneuvers,   as   well   as   maintaining  
         appropriate  distances  from  people,  vessels,  vehicles  and  structures.  
           
         Further,  John-Paul  Clark  submits  that  all  flights  of  DJI  UAS  aircraft,  conducted  by  the  PIC  
         pursuant  to  the  grant  of  this  Petition:  (1)  will  be  incidental  to  John-Paul  Clark  business;  
         and  (2)  will  not  carry  passengers  or  property  for  compensation  or  hire.  
Section  61.23(a)  
         Relief   from   Section   61.23(a),   entitled   Operations   requiring   a   medical   certificate:  
         Requirements  and  duration,  is  requested  to  the  extent  required  to  necessary  to  allow  a  
         PIC   holding   a   sport   pilot   certificate   or   higher   level   certificate,   as   well   as   a   current   and  
         valid   driver's   license,   to   conduct   the   proposed   UAS   flight   operations   for   compensation  
         or  hire.  
           
         This   relief   is   requested   since   the   limitations   set   forth   in   Section   61.23(a)   otherwise  
         require   the   PIC   of   any   flight   for   compensation   or   hire   to   hold   a   comprehensive   FAA  
         issued  medical  certificate.  
Section  61.315(a)  
         Relief  from  Section  61.315(a)  entitled  What  are  the  privileges  and  limits  of  my  sport  pilot  
         certificate,   is   requested   to   the   extent   necessary   to   allow   a   PIC   holding   a   sport   pilot   or  
         higher  level  certificate  to  conduct  the  proposed  UAS  flight  operations  for  compensation  
         or  hire.  
           
         This  relief  is  requested  since  the  limitations  set  forth  in  Section  61.315(a)  restrict  a  sport  
         pilot  from  acting  as  the  PIC  of  any  flight  for  compensation  or  hire,  or  for  the  furtherance  
         of  any  business.  
           
         Additionally,   similar   to   the   private   and   commercial   pilot   certificates,   holders   of  
         recreational   and   sport   pilot   certificates   are   subject   to   security   screening   by   the  
         Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS).  
           
         Therefore,   because   they   must   demonstrate   aeronautical   knowledge   relevant   to   UAS  
         operations  and  are  subject  to  DHS  screening,  factors  that  were  considered  by  the  FAA  in  
         allowing   private   pilot   operations   under   previous   exemptions,   the   FAA   now   determines  
         that   holders   of   recreational   and   sport   pilot   certificates   may   serve   as   the   PIC   for   UAS  
         operations.  

                                                                8  
                                                                   
Section  91.7(a)  
         Relief   from   Section   91.7(a)   entitled   Civil   aircraft   airworthiness,   is   requested   to   the  
         extent   required   to   allow   John-Paul   Clark   to   determine   that   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   are   in  
         airworthy  condition  prior  to  every  flight  by  ensuring  that  the  UAS  is  in  compliance  with  
         the   operating   documents   (i.e.,   the   Monthly   Maintenance   Log,   and   DJI   UAS   Aircraft  
         instruction  manuals).  
           
         John-Paul   Clark   seeks   the   requested   relief   because   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   do   not   require  
         an  airworthiness  certificate  in  accordance  with  14  C.F.R.  Part  21,  Subpart  H.  Therefore,  
         John-Paul   Clark   will   ensure   that   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   are   in   airworthy   condition   based  
         upon  its  compliance  with  the  operating  documents  (i.e.,  Monthly  Maintenance  Log,  and  
         DJI   UAS   Aircraft   instruction   manuals)   prior   to   every   flight,   and   further,   determine   that  
         the   aircraft   are   in   condition   for   safe   flight,   as   stated   in   the   conditions   and   limitations  
         below.  

Section  91.121  
         Relief   from   Section   91.121,   entitled   Altimeter   settings,   may   be   required   to   allow   flight  
         operations   of   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft,   which   utilize   a   barometric   pressure   sensor,   GPS  
         equipment,   and   a   radio   communications   telemetry   data   link   to   downlink   altitude  
         information   from   the   UA   to   the   PIC   at   the   ground   control   station   (GCS).   Since   the   FAA  
         requires   that   any   altitude   information   concerning   UAS   operations   be   reported   to   air  
         traffic   control   (ATC)   in   feet   above   ground   level   (AGL),   John-Paul   Clark   seeks   the  
         requested  relief  because  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  altimeter  may  be  set  on  the  ground  to  zero  
         feet  AGL,  rather  than  the  local  barometric  pressure  or  field  altitude,  before  each  flight.  
           
         Considering  the  limited  altitude  of  the  proposed  operations,  relief  from  91.121  is  sought  
         to  the  extent  necessary  to  comply  with  the  applicable  conditions  and  limitations  stated  
         below.   As   more   fully   set   forth   herein,   an   equivalent   level   of   safety   will   be   maintained  
         since   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   are   equipped   with   a   barometric   pressure   sensor   and   GPS  
         equipment,   which   automatically   ensures   that   a   ground   level   pressure   setting   will   be  
         established  prior  to  each  flight,  and  provides  the  PIC  with  altitude  information  of  the  UA  
         on  the  heads-up  display  of  the  GCS.    

Section  91.151(b)  
         Relief   from   Section   91.151(b)   entitled   Fuel   requirements   for   flight   in   VFR   conditions,   is  
         requested  to  the  extent  required  to  allow  flights  of  the  battery  powered  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  
         during  daylight  hours  in  visual  meteorological  conditions  (VMC),  under  visual  flight  rules  
         (VFR),   for   a   total   duration   of   15   minutes   to   the   first   point   of   intended   landing   and,  
         assuming  normal  cruising  speed,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  least  5  minutes.  John-Paul  Clark  
         seeks   the   requested   relief   because   without   an   exemption   from   Section   91.151(b),   the  
         flight   time   duration   of   the   battery   powered   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   will   severely   constrain   the  
         practicality   of   any   aerial   video   or   still   photo   flight   operations   that   John-Paul   Clark  
         proposes  to  conduct  pursuant  to  this  Petition.  
           

                                                                9  
                                                                   
         Significantly,   as   set   forth   below,   the   technical   specifications   of   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft  
         operating   documents,   and   John-Paul   Clark   proposed   operating   limitations,   ensure   that  
         John-Paul  Clark  will  safely  operate  the  battery  powered  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  during  daylight  
         hours   in   visual   meteorological   conditions   (VMC),   under   visual   flight   rules   (VFR),   with  
         enough   battery   power   to   fly   for   a   total   duration   of   15   minutes   to   the   first   point   of  
         intended   landing   and,   assuming   normal   cruising   speed,   to   fly   after   that   for   at   least   5  
         minutes.  
Sections  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(1),  91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  And  91.417(a)  &  (b)  
         Since   Sections   91.405(a),   91.407(a)(1),   91.409(a)(1)   &   (a)(2),   and   91.417(a)   &   (b)   only  
         apply   to   aircraft   with   an   airworthiness   certificate,   John-Paul   Clark   requests   relief   from  
         these  Sections  because  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  do  not  require  airworthiness  certificates.  As  
         set  forth  more  fully  below,  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  meet  the  conditions  of  FMRA  Section  333  for  
         operation  without  an  airworthiness  certificate.  
           
         Accordingly,   John-Paul   Clark   will   use   trained   technicians   to   perform   maintenance,  
         alterations,  or  preventive  maintenance  on  the  UASs  using  the  methods,  techniques,  and  
         practices   prescribed   in   the   UAS   operating   documents   (i.e.,   the   Monthly   Maintenance  
         Log   and   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   Instruction   Manual).   Furthermore,   John-Paul   Clark   will  
         document  and  maintain  all  maintenance  records  for  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft.  

THE  GREATER  PUBLIC  INTEREST  

Granting   the   present   Petition   will   further   the   public   interest   by   allowing   John-Paul   Clark   to  
safely,  efficiently,  and  economically  perform  aerial  photography  and  videography  of  real  estate,  
construction  sites,  and  landscape  over  certain  areas  of  the  United  States.  
  
Additionally,  use  of  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  will  decrease  congestion  of  the  NAS,  reduce  pollution,  
and   provide   significant   benefits   to   the   economy.   Notably,   the   benefits   of   John-Paul   Clark  
proposed   operation   of   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   will   be   realized   without   implicating   any   privacy  
issues.  

PRIVACY  

Similar   to   the   manned   aerial   acquisition   flight   operations   that   have   been   conducted   for  
decades,   John-Paul   Clark   proposed   operation   of   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   will   not   implicate   any  
privacy   issues.   Specifically,   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   will   be   operated   only   in   compliance   with  
operating  documents  (i.e.,  Monthly  Maintenance  Log,  and  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  Instruction  Manual)  
which  requires  property  owner  involvement  as  well  as  local  law  enforcement  notification,  and  
in   accordance   with   the   Federal   Aviation   Regulations,   including   the   minimum   altitude  
requirements  of  14  C.F.R.  §  91.119.  

                                                                10  
                                                                   
SAFETY  

  
In  seeking  this  exemption,  John-Paul  Clark  submits  that  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  can  operate  safely  
in  the  NAS  pursuant  to  FMRA  Section  333,  as  demonstrated  by:    

    a) the  characteristics  of  the  DJI  UAS  aircraft;    
    b) the  pilot  certification  requirement;  and    
    c) the  specific  operating  limitations.  

The  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  Specifications  &  Characteristics  
The  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  do  not  create  a  hazard  to  users  of  the  NAS  or  the  public,  or  otherwise  pose  
a  threat  to  national  security  considering  its  size,  weight,  speed,  and  operational  capability.  

           
    § The  technical  specifications  of  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  are  set  forth  by  the  DJI  UAS  aircraft  

         User  Manuals,  attached  hereto  as  Appendix  A  and  B.  
  

    § The   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   Autonomous   Flight   and   Navigation   Modes   Enable   The   UASs   to  
         Remain  Within  a  Defined  Operational  Area.  

  
    § The   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   may   be   operated   in   both   manual   and   fully   autonomous   flight  
         modes.   A   complete   description   of   the   flight   and   navigational   modes   of   the   DJI   UAS  
         Aircraft  provided  in  the  User  Manuals,  attached  hereto  as  Appendix  A  and  B.  

  
    § The  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  Are  Designed  for  Automatic  Return  to  Home  Point  or  Hover  in  The  
         Event  of  Loss  of  the  Control  Link  or  Navigation.  

  
    § When  the  Control  Link  is  lost,  the  DJI  UAS  Aircraft  will  remain  stationary,  in  flight,  for  3  
         seconds   or   more.   If,   after   3   seconds,   the   DJI   UAS   Aircraft   do   not   reacquire   control   link  
         data   from   the   GCS,   the   UAs   will   assume   that   the   Control   Link   is   lost   and   the   UAs   will  
         return  to  the  home  position  (i.e.,  failsafe  mode)  via  GPS,  and  will  descend  to  the  takeoff  
         position  and  shutdown.  

  
    § A  complete  description  of  the  Failsafe  Functions  of  the  DJI  UAS  aircraft  are  described  in  
         the  User  Manuals,  attached  hereto  as  Appendix  A  and  B.  

Specific  Operating  Limitations  
In   seeking   this   exemption,   John-Paul   Clark   proposes   to   commercially   operate   DJI   UAS   Aircraft  
for  the  special  purpose  of  conducting  aerial  photography  and  videography  over  certain  areas  of  
United  States,  pursuant  to  the  following  specific  operating  limitations:  

      
    1. UAS   operations   under   this   exemption   will   be   limited   to   conducting   operations   for   the  

         purpose  of  aerial  photography  and  videography.  
    2. The  UA  may  not  be  flown  at  an  indicated  airspeed  exceeding  45  knots.  
    3. The  UA  must  be  operated  at  an  altitude  of  no  more  than  400  feet  above  ground  level  

         (AGL),   as   indicated   by   the   procedures   specified   in   the   operating   documents   unless   a  

                                                                11  
                                                                   
    special   request   is   made   and   approved   by   ATC.   All   altitudes   reported   to   ATC   must   be   in  
    feet  AGL.  
4. The  UAs  must  be  operated  within  visual  line  of  sight  (VLOS)  of  the  PIC  at  all  times.  This  
    requires   the   PIC   to   be   able   to   use   human   vision   unaided   by   any   device   other   than  
    corrective  lenses,  as  specified  on  the  PIC's  FAA-issued  airman  medical  certificate.  
5. As  a  safety  observer  (SO)  may  be  used  to  satisfy  the  VLOS  requirement  as  long  as  the  PIC  
    always  maintains  VLOS  capability.  The  SO  and  PIC  must  be  able  to  communicate  verbally  
    at  all  times.  The  PIC  must  be  designated  before  the  flight  and  cannot  transfer  his  or  her  
    designation  for  the  duration  of  the  flight.  The  PIC  must  ensure  that  the  SO  can  perform  
    the  functions  prescribed  in  the  operating  documents.  
6. The   SO   must   not   perform   any   other   duties   beyond   assisting   the   PIC   with   seeing   and  
    avoiding   other   air   traffic   and   other   ground   based   obstacles/obstructions   and   is   not  
    permitted  to  operate  the  camera  or  other  instruments.    
7. The   operating   documents   and   the   grant   of   exemption   must   be   accessible   during   UAS  
    operations   and   made   available   to   the   Administrator   upon   request.   If   a   discrepancy  
    exists   between   the   conditions   and   limitations   contained   in   the   grant   of   exemption   and  
    the   procedures   outlined   in   the   operating   documents,   the   conditions   and   limitations  
    contained  in  the  grant  of  exemption  take  precedence  and  must  be  followed.  Otherwise,  
    the   operator   must   follow   the   procedures   as   outlined   in   its   operating   documents.   The  
    operator   may   update   or   revise   its   operating   documents.   It   is   the   operator's  
    responsibility  to  track  such  revisions  and  present  updated  and  revised  documents  to  the  
    Administrator   upon   request.   The   operator   must   also   present   updated   and   revised  
    documents  if  it  petitions  for  extension  or  amendment  to  the  grant  of  exemption.  If  the  
    operator  determines  that  any  update  or  revision  would  affect  the  basis  upon  which  the  
    FAA  granted  the  exemption,  then  the  operator  must  petition  for  amendment  to  its  grant  
    of  exemption.    
8. Prior  to  each  flight  the  PIC  must  inspect  the  UAS  to  ensure  that  it  is  in  a  condition  for  
    safe   flight.   If   the   inspection   reveals   a   condition   that   affects   the   safe   operation   of   the  
    UAS,  the  aircraft  is  prohibited  from  operating  until  the  necessary  maintenance  has  been  
    performed  and  the  UAS  is  found  to  be  in  a  condition  for  safe  flight.  The  Ground  Control  
    Station   must   be   included   in   the   preflight   inspection.   All   maintenance   and   alterations  
    must  be  properly  documented  in  the  aircraft  records.  
9. Any  UAS  that  has  undergone  maintenance  or  alterations  that  affect  the  UAS  operation  
    or  flight  characteristics,  e.g.  replacement  of  a  flight  critical  component,  must  undergo  a  
    functional  test  flight.  The  PIC  who  conducts  the  functional  test  flight  must  make  an  entry  
    in  the  aircraft  records.  
10. The   pre-flight   inspection   must   account   for   all   potential   discrepancies,   e.g.   inoperable  
    components,   items,   or   equipment,   not   already   covered   in   the   relevant   sections   of   the  
    operating  documents.  
11. The   operator   must   follow   the   UAS   manufacturer's   aircraft/component,   maintenance,  
    overhaul,  replacement,  inspection,  and  life  limit  requirements.  
12. The   operator   must   carry   out   its   maintenance,   inspections,   and   record   keeping  
    requirements,   in   accordance   with   the   operating   documents.   Maintenance,   inspection,  
    alterations,  and  status  of  replacement/overhaul  component  parts  must  be  noted  in  the  

                                                           12  
                                                              
    aircraft   records,   including   total   time   in   service,   description   of   work   accomplished,   and  
    the  signature  of  the  authorized  person  returning  the  UAS  to  service.  
13. Each   UASs   operated   under   this   exemption   must   comply   with   all   manufacturer   Safety  
    Bulletins.  
14. The  authorized  person  must  make  an  entry  in  the  aircraft  record  of  the  corrective  action  
    taken   against   discrepancies   discovered   between   inspections.   The   operator   may   not  
    permit  any  PIC  to  operate  unless  the  PIC  meets  the  operator's  qualification  criteria  and  
    demonstrates  the  ability  to  safely  operate  the  UAS  in  a  manner  consistent  with  how  the  
    UAS  will  be  operated  under  the  exemption,  including  evasive  and  emergency  maneuvers  
    and   maintaining   appropriate   distances   from   persons,   vessels,   vehicles   and   structures.  
    PIC   qualification   flight   hours   must   be   logged   in   a   manner   consistent   with   14   C.F.R.   §  
    61.51(b).  Flights  for  the  purposes  of  training  the  operator's  PICs  are  permitted  under  the  
    terms   of   the   exemption.   However,   training   operations   may   only   be   conducted   during  
    dedicated  training  sessions.  During  training,  proficiency,  and  experience-building  flights,  
    all   persons   not   essential   for   flight   operations   are   considered   nonparticipants,   and   the  
    PIC  must  operate  the  UA  with  appropriate  distance  from  nonparticipants  in  accordance  
    with  14  C.F.R.  §  91.119.  
15. UAS  operations  may  not  be  conducted  during  night,  as  defined  in  14  C.F.R.  
16. §  1.1.  All  operations  must  be  conducted  under  visual  meteorological  conditions  (VMC).  If  
    flight   at   night   is   required,   a   special   request   will   be   made   at   the   FAA   office   closest   to  
    proposed   area   of   operations.   Flights   under   special   visual   flight   rules   (SVFR)   are   not  
    authorized.  
17. The   UAV   may   not   operate   within   5   nautical   miles   of   an   airport   reference   point   as  
    denoted   on   a   current   FAA-published   aeronautical   chart   unless   a   letter   of   agreement  
    with   that   airport's   management   is   obtained,   and   the   operation   is   conducted   in  
    accordance  with  a  NOTAM  as  required  by  the  operator's  COA.  The  letter  of  agreement  
    with   the   airport   management   must   be   made   available   to   the   Administrator   upon  
    request.  
18. The   UAV   may   not   be   operated   less   than   500   feet   below   or   less   than   2,000   feet  
    horizontally  from  a  cloud  or  when  visibility  is  less  than  3  statute  miles  from  the  PIC.  
19. If   the   UAV   loses   communications   or   loses   its   GPS   signal,   it   must   return   to   a   pre-
    determined   location   within   the   planned   operating   area   and   land   or   be   recovered   in  
    accordance  with  the  operating  documents.  
20. The   PIC   must   abort   the   flight   in   the   event   of   unpredicted   obstacles   or   emergencies   in  
    accordance  with  the  operating  documents.  
21. The   PIC   is   prohibited   from   beginning   a   flight   unless   (considering   wind   and   forecast  
    weather   conditions)   there   is   enough   power   to   fly   at   normal   cruising   speed   to   the  
    intended  landing  point  and  land  the  UAV  with  20%  battery  power  remaining.  
22. Before   conducting   operations,   the   radio   frequency   spectrum   used   for   operation   and  
    control  of  the  UAV  must  comply  with  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  or  
    other  appropriate  government  oversight  agency  requirements.  
23. The  documents  required  fewer  than  14  C.F.R.  91.9  and  91.203  must  be  available  to  the  
    PIC   at   the   Ground   Control   Station   of   the   UAS   any   time   the   UAS   is   operating.   These  

                                                           13  
                                                              
         documents  must  be  made  available  to  the  Administrator  or  any  law  enforcement  official  
         upon  request.  
    24. The  UAV  must  remain  clear  and  yield  the  right  of  way  to  all  manned  aviation  operations  
         and  activities  at  all  times.  
    25. The  UAV  may  not  be  operated  by  the  PIC  from  any  moving  device  or  vehicle.  
    26. Flight  operations  must  be  conducted  at  least  500  feet  from  all  nonparticipating  persons  
         (persons   other   than   the   PIC,   SO,   operator   trainees   or   essential   persons),   vessels,  
         vehicles,  and  structures  unless:  
    27. Barriers  or  structures  are  present  that  sufficiently  protect  nonparticipating  persons  from  
         the   UAV   and/or   debris   in   the   event   of   an   accident.   The   operator   must   ensure   that  
         nonparticipating   persons   remain   under   such   protection.   If   a   situation   arises   where  
         nonparticipating  persons  leave  such  protection  and  are  within  500  feet  of  the  UA,  flight  
         operations   must   cease   immediately   and/or;   32.   The   aircraft   is   operated   near   vessels,  
         vehicles  or  structures  where  the  owner/controller  of  such  vessels,  vehicles  or  structures  
         has   granted   permission   and   the   PIC   has   made   a   safety   assessment   of   the   risk   of  
         operating   closer   to   those   objects   and   determined   that   it   does   not   present   an   undue  
         hazard,  and;  
    28. Operations  nearer  to  the  PIC,  SO,  operator  trainees  or  essential  persons  do  not  present  
         an  undue  hazard  to  those  persons  per  §  91.119(a).  
    29. All   operations   shall   be   conducted   over   private   or   controlled-access   property   with  
         permission   from   the   land   owner/controller   or   authorized   representative.   Permission  
         from  land  owner/controller  or  authorized  representative  will  be  obtained  for  each  flight  
         to  be  conducted.  
    30. Any   incident,   accident,   or   flight   operation   that   transgresses   the   lateral   or   vertical  
         boundaries  of  the  operational  area  as  defined  by  the  applicable  COA  must  be  reported  
         to  the  FAA's  UAS  Integration  Office  (AFS-80)  within  24  hours.  
    31. Accidents   must   be   reported   to   the   National   Transportation   Safety   Board   (NTSB)   per  
         instructions  contained  on  the  NTSB  Web  site:  www.ntsb.gov.  

CONCLUSION  

As   set   forth   herein,   John-Paul   Clark   seeks   an   exemption   pursuant   to   14   C.F.R.   §   11.61   and
