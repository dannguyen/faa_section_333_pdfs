                                                           Exemption No. 12953
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2621

Ms. Barbara M. Weinkle
dba TransCarolina Marketing/tcmphotos
P.O. Box 18053
Asheville, NC 28814

Dear Ms. Weinkle:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 15, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Ms. Barbara M. Weinkle dba TransCarolina Marketing/tcmphotos (hereinafter
petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned
aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography, videography, and cinematography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, TransCarolina Marketing/tcmphotos is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, TransCarolina Marketing/tcmphotos is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
                                                                                                            4

    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;
      c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
          the UAS;
      d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
      e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;

Re: Exemption request under Section 333 of the Federal Aviation Administration Reform Act of
2012. Specifically, I request exemption from 14 CFR Part 21; 45.23(b); 61.113 (a) and (b); 91.7
(a); 91.9(b) (2); 91.103(b); 91.109; 119.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a) & (b); 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(l);
91.409(a) (2); 91.417(a)&(b)

To Whom it may concern:

I am petitioning for an exemption in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) Modernization and Reform Act of2012 and procedures contained in 14 Code ofFederal
Regulations (CPR) 11 to request that I, an owner and operator of a small unmanned aircraft, be
exempted from the Federal Aviation Regulations (PARS) listed herein so that I may operate a
small, ultralight unmanned aircraft system (UAS) commercially in the National Airspace System
(NAS). Given the nature of my operations and exemptions granted to others, it would seem that
my request may qualify for a "summary grant."

For the past 37 years I have been providing real estate photography for the regional real estate
companies and local government agencies to better exhibit and promote this mountainous region
of North Carolina. I am a licensed driver in North Carolina with a sterling driving record. My
husband is a licensed commercial pilot, and former Naval Aviator with more than 6000 hours
fixed and rotary wing flight time. He has served as a squadron Chief Safety Officer; helicopter
flight instructor; chief safety officer, and Director of Operations for a FAR Part 135 helicopter

                                                                      1
charter company. He will serve as my supervisor. I have purchased a DJI Phantom 2 ultralight
UAS equipped with a GoPro Hero 3+ camera for aerial
photography/videography/cinematography for commercial and private real estate sales and
development, scientific and other lawful purposes in the mountains and piedmont of western
North Carolina and upper South Carolina.

I plan to operate my UAS at or below 200' AGL, within line-of-sight, under VFR conditions,
and in a manner not to hazard other aircraft or people or property. Under direct supervision of
my husband, I or other persons with a current driver's license or pilot's license will fly the UAS
using sound judgement and concern for safety.

My request falls under the Secretary of Transportation's authority granted in Section 333 ofthe
FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. By granting my petition to operate my UAS for
commercial purposes I will contribute to responsible development in environmentally sensitive
western North Carolina and upper South Carolina; provide technical and scientific data on the
region; and provide more meaningful and useful real estate listings in the region at affordable
pnces.

II. Extent and rationale for relief:

This application is submitted in accordance with the FAA Modernization and Refonn Act of
2012 (PL 112-95) §§ 331-334 seeking relief from applicable FAR's that would prevent me from
operating a UAS for commercial, cinematic/videographic, and scientific/technical purposes
within the NAS. In addition, I live in mountainous terrain, and every year people become lost or
fall over precipices or waterfalls. My UAS would be invaluable to rescue personnel allowing
them to search impassable or hazardous areas. Section 332 provides for integration of civil
unmanned aircraft systems since it is in the public's interest to do so. My UAS meets the
definition of "small unmanned aircraft" as defined in Section 331. I wish to operate my UAS
prior to promulgation of the rules governing such aircraft. Those operations would help provide
data for future operations of all such systems.

 My UAS is a Phantom 2 quadracopter manufactured by DJI which weighs 1 kg., including
battery. Maximum take-off weight is 1.3 kg. The aircraft maximum speed is 15 meters/sec.
Climb/descent velocities are 6m/s and 2m/s, respectively. Additional specifications are found in
Enclosure (2).

                                                                      2
My flight supervisor's 6000+ hours of accident-free flight time reflect an overriding concern for
flight safety. That also reflects a respect for other air traffic and the general public and it is not
my intention to hazard either with my UAS operations. Further, when operated responsibly, the
characteristics and capabilities of my UAS preclude many operational hazards inherent in other
aircraft operations. It has very limited range, airspeed, and altitude capabilities. The UAS is
protected by a failsafe system which will return the aircraft to the point of takeoff in the event of
failed communication with the controller. It carries no volatile fuel and is emission free.

III. Benefit to the public:

Passage of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act signaled Congress's belief that it is in the
public's interest to integrate UAS's into the NAS. That interest is abundantly clear in western
North Carolina. Western North Carolina's environment invites development, but its
mountainous terrain makes it difficult to screen land for potential, responsible, safe development.
Much ofthe area is subject to sometime fatal landslides, and often, unstable slopes are detectable
only from the air. A UAS provides potential real estate clients with airborne assessments of
properties inexpensively, and enables detection of potential development issues and hazards
inherent to steep terrain. The region, with its national forests and wilderness areas and waterfalls
is also attractive to hikers and campers. However, every year there are several incidents of lost
hikers or people being swept over waterfalls resulting in expensive, and sometimes hazardous,
search and rescue efforts. Often, a UAS would complement other aerial and ground search
assets by extending searches into limited, but otherwise hazardous or inaccessible cliffs, caves,
grottoes, or ravines.

IV. A summary for the Federal Register:

  A 14 CFR. 21 and 14 CFR 91: Airworthiness certificates, etc.

       1. 14 CFR 21, Subpart H (Airworthiness Certificates) sets forth a requirement for
       obtaining airworthiness certificates as prescribed by FAR §91.202(a) 1. The size, weight,
       and operational area of my UAS permits exemption from Part 21, because my UAS meets
       and exceeds the level of safety dictated by Section 333 ofthe Reform Act. The FAA is
       authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement under both the
      Act (49 USC §44701 (f), and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces oflegislation
       allow UAS exemptions from the airworthiness certification based on weight, size, speed,
       maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and densely populated areas.

       2. 14 CFR §91.7 (a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness
       certificate. Airworthiness certification is not applicable as contemplated by the FARs.

       3. 14 CFR §91.9 (b) 2 requires an aircraft flight manual in every aircraft. This regulation
       does not apply since my aircraft is unmanned by definition. An equivalent level of safety
       can be achieved by the remote pilot following the procedures laid down in the flight
       manual. The FAA has already issued many exemptions to this requirement.

                                                                     3
       4. 14 CFR §91.121 does not apply since my UAS uses GPS for position fixing and altitude
       sensing. 14 CFR §91.203 (a) and (b) do not apply since this is a UAS.

B. 14 CFR §45.23: Aircraft marking
      1. Regulations require certain markings. However, my UAS has no cockpit, crew station,
      or cabin. Further, there is no surface large enough to place two inch lettering. However, I
      will mark the UAS registration number with the largest numerals possible at the intersection
      of the pylons or on the pylons as required by CFR §45.29 (f). In addition, common sense
      dictates that I label it with ownership identification. The FAA has set a precedent by
      granting exemptions to these requirements.

C. 14 CFR §61.113: Private pilot restrictions and pilot in command (PIC)
    1. Private pilots are restricted to non-commercial operations. I can achieve an equivalent
    level of safety required by current regulations since my UAS carries no crew or passengers.
    Remote controlled aircraft the nature of my UAS do not require the same skill as those
    required of either a commercial or private pilot. For a UAS, the primary safety requirement
    is avoidance of other aircraft, structures or people. The skills required of a remote pilot of a
    small UAS easily meet those requirements or exceed them. Finally, my supervisor holds
    both private and commercial licenses for both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.

D. 14 CFR 91.119: Minimum safe altitudes
     1. My UAS will not operate above 200 feet AGL, safely below the standard 400 foot
     ceiling. I intend to operate my UAS away from air traffic and in a manner not to threaten
     people. The size, weight, maneuverability, and speed of my UAS allow me to meet or
     exceed the safety level prescribed by the FAR's.

E. 14 CFR §91.405(a), 407(a) 1, 409 (a) 2, 417 (a) & (b): Maintenance inspections
     1. The regulations listed above require regular, periodic inspections, and require
     discrepancies repaired. However, those regulations apply only to certificated aircraft, and
     will not apply to my UAS. However, both safety and financial considerations require
     inspections of the UAS before and after each flight.

                                                                    4
I, Barbara M. Weinkle seek an exemption from the regulations listed and discussed above in
order to operate a UAS for commercial purposes as described herein. Those operations can be
conducted in a manner that meets or exceeds those imposed by the FARs and will provide a
public benefit.
Respectfully submitted,

~~4~u)~

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards
and backwards), Roll {left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller
contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.
The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both
attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)
to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is
used to communicate with the remote controller and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control
system connecting and controlling all the modules together.

              The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.
               This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more
                information.

1.2 Connections with Other DJI Products

PHANTOM 2 is compatible with other DJI products, including ZENMUSE H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal , iOSD mini ,

iOSD Mark II. Below are connections for these products and wireless video transmission module.

transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the

total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the

wireless video transmission module.

( 3 ) PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to

         use other L.40Hz dev1ces t_mcludmg L.4\.:J VV J-r-t or L.40 Wireless Vtdeo transmtsston modulej except the

       2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Data link.

( 4 ) Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
       compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

( 5) To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
        updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
       while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

                                                                           Figure l-4

2.1 Assembly

1. ( Figure 2-1 ) Remove the four warning cards from the motors after you 've read them.

2. ( Figure 2-2 ) Prepare the two grey nut propellers and two black nut propellers. Make sure to match the

black nut propellers with the correctly marked black dot motors. Tighten the propellers according to the

fastening instructions.

2.2 Disassembly

   ( Figure 2-3 ) Keep the motor deadlocked in place with the assistant wrench (or one hand) and remove the
  propeller according to the un-fastening instructions.

2.3 Notes

  1. Propellers are self tightening during flight. DO NOT use any thread locker on the threads.
  2. Make sure to match the propeller nut colors with the corresponding motors.
  3. It is advised to wear protective gloves during propeller assembly and removal.
  4. Check that the propellers and motors are installed correctly and firmly before every flight.
  5. Check that all propellers are in good condition before flight. DO NOT use any ageing, chipped, or broken

        propellers.
  6. To avoid injury, STAND CLEAR of and DO NOT touch the propellers or motors when they are spinning.

3.4 Remote Controller Operation

  The operations of remote controller are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

  Definitions

  The 'stick neutral' positions and 'stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote controller are placed at
  the centraI position.
  To 'move the stick' means that the stick of remote controller is pushed away from the central position.
  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between O"C to 40°C, and be discharged in an

       environment that is between -20°C to 50°C. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
       Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
       be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
       procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40-50% capacity in a strong battery box
       securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it

              5 Ca1ibrating the Compass

                   IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

_J The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

 '

                     poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

                     its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnin s

               ( 1) DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong
                        magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

 0 underground.
               ( 2) DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
                        phones.
               ( 3) Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

 ( 1 ) When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
 ( 2 ) Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
 ( 3 ) The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
 ( 4 ) Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Fl in Environment Re uirements
           ( 1 ) Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                    practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).
            ( 2 ) DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
            ( 3 ) The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure
                    within buildings may interfere with the compass.
            ( 4 ) Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
            ( 5 ) Try to avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment (No base
                    stations or cell towers around).
          ( 6 ) The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          ( 7 ) Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic
                    lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors
A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

               A Bc D

                                                                                        Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures
  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote controller.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly
       (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Controller Operation>
       for more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.241
       place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

       middle position after the motors have stopped.

           You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
           aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
            ( 1 ) When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                    Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
            ( 2 } A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                    rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
            ( 3 ) Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
            ( 4 ) Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                    temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                    battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
            ( 5 } When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                    close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                    propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote controller is lost. The flight control
system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote controller and enter Failsafe mode:
 ( 1 ) The remote controller is powered off.
( 2 ) The remote controller is powered on but the 51 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must

         have been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
 ( 3 } The aircraft has flown out ofthe effective communication range ofthe remote controller.
 ( 4 ) There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote controller and the aircraft, essentially

         reducing the distance the signal can travel.
 ( 5 ) There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote controller.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) --Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

©2013-2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 I
When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

         ( 1 ) In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
                will descend automatically.

         ( 2 ) When the aircraft is landing automatically, users can control the aircraft's position and altitude if
                the remote controller signal is recovered.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status

as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote

controller from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position

as a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks

on the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:

         ( 1 ) The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is
                recorded last time.

         ( 2 ) The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

         .J4distance will be displayed as              if using iOSD module.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
 ( 1 ) When battery power drops below 30o/o and LED indicator wiH biink red slowly.
 ( 2 ) At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

     land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
 ( 3 ) There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
     Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

               ( 1 ) Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
               ( 2 ) Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                       cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function
