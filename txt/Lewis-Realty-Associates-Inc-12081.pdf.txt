                                                          Exemption No. 12081
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0195

Mr. Chris Rackley
Lewis Realty Associates, Inc.
320 North New River Drive
Surf City, NC 28445

Dear Mr. Rackley:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Lewis Realty Associates, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to provide photos and videos of real estate listings offered for rental and sale, photos
and videos used to promote tourism.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received one comment in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a Lewis Realty Associates Hexacopter 650.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Lewis Realty Associates, Inc. is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Lewis Realty Associates, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Lewis Realty
         Associates Hexacopter 650 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
         Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
         amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
                                                                                                            4

    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;
      c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
          the UAS;
      d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
      e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
      f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
          and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those
          who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;
      g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
      h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city,
          town, county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted and the altitudes
          essential to accomplish the operation.

31. Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating persons
    consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production, as specified in the
    exemption holder's MPTOM.

in accordance with FAA Policy N 8900.227 Section 14 "Operational Requirements for UAS" with
the following additional restrictions:

     · All operations will occur in Class G airspace at no more than 400' AGL. The vast
          majority of flights will be well below this limit at an average of 150' to 200' AGL to
          accomplish the best photographs and videos.

     · Any required permits will be obtained from local and state governments before flights.
     · The aircraft will not operate directly above human beings at any time or within 150 feet of

          human beings.
      · Maximum Flight Time will be 12 minutes. Battery allows 18 minutes plus of flight time.

           Batteries are inspected and always fully charged before use.
      · The aircraft will not operate within 5 miles of an airport/heliport without prior approval

          from said airport/heliport.
      · All operations will be during the daytime and in ideal weather conditions of less than 15

           mph winds and clear skies.

     · Aircraft will remain in visual line of site at all times not to exceed "X mile from PIC.

      · Visual Observer will serve as additional eyes on the aircraft and be within voice reach to
           communicate with the PIC.

      · Aircraft will not fly in the area of any full scale aircraft and if a full scale aircraft comes
           into airspace during the aircraft's flight, it will be landed immediately to allow right of way
           to full scale aircraft.

      · At any time aircraft is being flown, signs will be posted in at least three (3) locations,
           warning of UAS operations are being conducted and to stay at least 200' away at all
           times of landing and takeoff area. (marked with a large orange cone) .

      · The PIC (Chris Rackley) has flown different remote aircraft for over 10 years. The last
           three years has been exclusively multi-rotor types such has OJI Phantom (quadcopter),
           DJI F550 (hexacopter) and Custom 650 (hexacopter). There have been no incidents of
           injury or property damage.

14 CFR 91.9 (b):
There is no cockpit to include said manual. Operating manual will be kept with PIC.

14 CFR 91 .103:
Since there wi ll not be a FAA approved hexacopter manual to be provided we will need to be
exempt. We will again follow our enclosed pre-flight checklist to ensure safety and
airworthiness.

14 CFR 91.109:
UAS are controlled by a transmitter and do not have the capability for dual controls . It is our
understanding there have been other aircraft approved without dual controls .

14 CFR 91.119:
Since flights will never be above 400' AGL and usually 150' to 200' AGL, we requested an
exemption as the altitudes cited in 14 CFR 91.119 wou ld cause us to exceed said 400' AGL.

14 CFR 91.121 :
UAS does not have a traditional altimeter. It does however have a barometric type which
                                                                       times to prevent exceeding
displays the altitude on the transmitter of which is monitored at all  certain heights. There is also
400' AGL. The transmitter has voice announcements of altitude a
an alarm on the transmitter when reaching within 50' of 400' AGL.

14 CFR 91.151:
The UAS does not use traditional fuel but rather battery power. The battery provides for up to 18
minutes plus of flight time with a 20% reserve of battery power. If this level is reached the UAS
returns to home and lands. However, no flights wi ll last longer than 13 minutes as an extra
safety net.

All batteries are only used if freshly charged. All batteries are visually inspected and volt tested
before each flight.

14 CFR 91.203:
There is no cockpit to include said certificates or registration documents. Any certificates,
exemptions or registration documents will be with the PIC on the ground level.

14 CFR 91.405, 91 .407, 91 .409, 91 .417:
As there is no airworthiness inspections available therefore we request an exemption.

Again we will perform pre-flight checklists to ensure safety.

If our pre-flight checklist does not pass, we will abort flight.

Any items of concern will promptly be repaired using similar components and records will be
kept through maintenance record .

We are prepared to modify or amend any part of this petition for exemption to meet or exceed
concerns of safety. We do look forward to working with the FAA to provide a great service to our
community and profession in a safe manner.

Start & Stop Motor Knowledge

               (l) Both Immediately Mode and Intelligent Mode are available in the Assistant So ftware:

                          Advanced->Mot or->Stop Type.
                (2) Stop Motor method is defaulted to Immediately Mode.

Please get to know well about this section before flying.
1 Start Motor: Pushing throttle stick before takeo ff will not start the motors. You have to exec ute any one of

          following four Combinatio n Stick Commands (CSC) to start the mo tors:

I©2013 OJI Innovations. All Rights Reserved . 10
2 Stop Motor: We provide two o ptio ns to sto p motors in t he assista nt softwa re: Immed iately and Intelligent.
         (l) Immediately Mode: If you select this mode, in any control mod e, once motors start and th rott le sti ck is
                    over 10%, motors will not stop immediately o nly when throttle stick is back under 10% the motors will
                    stop. In t his case, if you push t he throttle stick over 10% w ithin 5 seconds after motors stop, motors
                    w ill re-start, CSC is not needed. I f you don't push throttle stick after motors start in t hree seco nds,
                    motors will stop automatica lly.
         (2) Intelligent Mode: By using this mode, different control mode ha s different way o f stopping motors. In
                    Manual Mode, only executing CSC can stop motor s. In A TTl. Mode or GPS A TTL M ode, any o ne o f
                    following four cases will stop motors:

                a) Yo u don 't push t hrottle stick after motors start wit hin three seconds;
               b) Executing CSC;
                 c) Throttle stick under 10%, and after landing for more than 3 seconds.
                d) If the ang le o f multi-rotor is over 70· , and throttle stick und er 10%.

Notes of lntellig_ent Mode

' (1) In ATTl. I GPS ATTL Mode, it has landing judgment, w hich w ill stop motors.
           (2) Start motors in ATTL I GPS A TTL Mode, you have to execute CSC and then push th rottle stick
                          over 10% in 3 seconds, otherwise motors will stop after 3 seconds.
             (3) Dur ing normal flight, o nly pull throttle st ick under 10% will not stop moto rs in any contro l mode.

             (4) Fo r sa fety reason, w hen the slope angle of mul ti -rotor is over 70 · during the flight in A TT l. I

             G PS ATTl. Mode (may be ca used by co llision, motor and ESC e rror or propeller b roke n down),

             and throttle stick is under 10%, motors will stop automatically.

        (l)  If you choose the Immediately Mode, you should not pull throttle stick under 10% during f li ght,

(2) DO NOT execute the CSC during normal flight without any reason, or it will stop motors at once.

      (1)    If you choose the Intelligent mode, and the throttle stick is under 10%, this will trigger the landing

Step1 Compass Calibration

Without GPS module, please skip t his step. If you use with GPS module, fol low step-by-step for ca libration.

        (1)  DO NOT calibr ate your compass where there is magnetic interference, such as magnetite, car
             park, and steel reinforcement under the ground.
0 (2)        DO NOT carry ferromag netic materials w it h you during calibration, such as keys o r ce ll phones.
             Compass module CANNOT work in the polar circle.
        (3)
        (4)  Compass Calibration is very impo rta nt, otherwise the system will work abnormal.

Calibration Procedures

1. Switch on the transmit ter, and then power on autopilot system!

2. Quickly switch t he control mode switch from GPS Mode to Manual Mode and back to GPS Mode (or
        from GPS Mode to ATTl Mode and back to GPS Mode) for more than 5 times, The LED indicator will

          tur n o n constantly yellow so that the aircraft is ready for t he calibration.
3. (Fig.1) Hold yo ur Multi-rotor horizontal and rotate it around the gravitational force line (about 360°) until

          the LED changes to constant green, and then go to the next step.
4. (Fig.2)Hold yo ur M ulti-rotor vertica lly and rotate it (its nose is downward) around the gravitational force

          line (about 360°) until the LED tu rns off, meaning the calibration is finished.

                                   Fig.1                            Fig.2

5. If the calibration was successful, ca libration mode will exit automatically. If the LED keeps flashing quick ly
          Red, the calibration has failed. Switch the control mode switch one time to cancel the calibratio n, and
          then re-start from step 2.

· 1. When the GPS is abnormal, the Main contro lle r will tell you by the LED blinking Red and Yellow
' alternately (I!S::.O
                     ATT l. Mode.  i), disa ble the GPS Module, and automatically e nter the aircraft into the

2. You don't need to rotate your multi-rotor on a precise horizontal o r ve rtical sur face, but keep at

             lea st 45 · differ ence b etween horizo ntal and vertica l calibration.

3. If you keep having calib ration failure, it migh t suggest tha t there is very strong magnetic

          interference around the GPS /Compass module, p lease avoid flying in this area.

4. When to do re-calibration

(1) The flight field is changed.

(2) When the multi-rotor mechanical setup has c hanged:

a) If the GPS/Compass module is re-positio ned.

b) If electronic devices are added/removed/ re-positioned (Main Controller, servos, batteries, etc.).

c) When the mechanical structure of the multi-rotor is changed.

(3) If the flight direction appears to be shifting (meani ng the multi-rotor doesn ' t "fly straight").

(4) The LED indicato r o ften indicates abnormality blinking when the multi-rotor spins. (It is normal

                          fo r t his to happen only occasionally)

                (4) Make sure batteries are fully cha rged for your tr ansmitter, autopilot system and all devices.

Step3Before Flight

Carry out the fo llowing procedures (is based on Intelligent Mode of Motor Stop) to make sure all

configurations are correct. Refer to the Appendix->LED Description for more LED details.

l. Always switch on the transmitter first, then power on multi-rotor!

2. Keep the aircraft stationary until the system start and self-check has finished (OOO O O OC O O OOOO ).

After that, the LED may blink Yellow 4 times quickly (0000 ). Start motor is disable during LED blinking

Yellow 4 times quickly (0000 ), as the system is warming up.

3. After the 4 times Yellow LED disappears, toggle the control mode switch on your transmitter to make sure it

is working properly. For example, LED blinks ( 0 000 ), which means the system is in A TTl. Mode and the

GPS signal is worst Check it with LED indicator to specify the current working mode for MC. See following

table for details about LED indicator;

(1) There are Manual Mode and ATil. Mode without a GPS/Compass module, no GPS signal status LED

indicator.

(2) After connecting to the GPS/Compass module, GPS A TTl. Mode is available, and GPS signal status

LED indicator is available.

 4. Keep the aircraft stationary, and then push both sticks to the left bottom or right bottom (shown as the
            following chart, defined as Combination Stick Commands (CSC)), to start the motors.

 5. Release the yaw, roll and pitch sticks and keep t hem at the mid point, and the throttle stick under the mid
           point. T hen check w hether all propellers are rotating correctly.

 6. Stop motors, power off the Multi-rotor.
 7. Make sure all settings and configurations are correct and then you ca n take off you aircraft.

 After power on, if abnormal LED Indicator occurs, please refer to the Abnormal LED instruction in the FAQ and
 aids troubleshooting.

Step4 Flying Test

   1. Choose an open space w it hout obstruction, tall buildings and crowds as flying filed. Place the aircraft 3
         meters away from you and others, to avoid accidental injury.

   2. If in GPS ATTl. Mode, place the aircraft in an open space withou t buildings or trees. Take off the aircraft
         after 6 or more GPS satellites are found (Red LED blinks o nce or no blinking). If in Manual Mode or ATTl.
         Mode, you can skip this step.

   3. Star t-up
          (1) Switch on the transm itter first, t hen power on multi-rotor! Keep the aircra ft stationary until t he
                     syst em start and se lf-check has finished.
           (2) Please wait fo r the system to warm up gradually with the LED blinks Yellow 4 times quickly
                     ( 0000 ). You should not start the motors unti l the blinking disappears.
           (3) Keep the aircraft stationary, and execute the CSC to start the motors.
           (4) Release the yaw, roll and pitch sticks and keep them at t he mid point, at the same time raise t he
                     throttle stick from the bottom. The motor s will stop if you do not push the throttle stick from the
                     bot tom within 3 sec and you will need to re-start the motors.
          (5) Keep raising the throttle stick until all the rotors are working, push the throttle stick to the mid point
                     and then take-off your multi -roto r gently, pay attention not to push the stick excessively.
          (6) Pay attention to the aircraft movement at any t ime when flying, and use the sticks to adjust t he
                     aircraft's position. Keep th e yaw, roll, pitch and throttle st icks at the mid point to hover the aircra ft
                     at the desired height.

  4. Lower the aircraft slowly. Pull the t hrottle stick to the bottom and then execute t he CSC to stop the motors

        after landing.

  5 . Please always power off the Multi-rotor first, and then switch off the transmitter after landing.

FLYING NOTES(VERY IMPORTANn!!!

            (l) If the warm up waiting is longer t han 2 minutes (the 4 times Yellow blink continues), please power
                       o ff for 10 minutes, cold start, and then connect the assistant software, enter the "Too ls" - , IMU

             ca libration, carry out the Advanced calibration.

(2) If you enable the Immediately Mode of Motor Stop; you should not pull throttle stick under 10%

             during flight, because it will stop motors. If you do it accidenta lly, you should push the throttle

      (3)    stick over 10% in 5s to re-start motors.
             DO NOT execute the CSC during normal flight without any reason, or it will stop motors at once.
        (4)  Pay attention to the GPS satell ite status LED indicator. Bad GPS signal may lead t he aircr aft to
             drift w hen hovering.
0            DO NOT fly near to ferromagnetic substances, to avoid str ong magnetic interference with t he
             GPS.
      (5)

(6) Please avoid using GPS A TTl. Mode in the areas, wher e GPS signal is most likely bad.
(7) If the LED flashes quickly Red then t hi s indicates battery voltage is low, la nd ASAP.

(8) If the transmitter indicates low-battery alarm, p lease land ASAP. In th is condition the t ransmitter

             may cause t he aircra ft to go out of contr ol or even crash.

(9) In GPS ATTl. Mode, make sur e that the home point is recorded when t he GPS signal is well;

             otherwise the home point recording may be not so precise.

(l) In ATTl Mode, throttle stick cen ter positio n is for Om/s along the vertical direction. You should

             keep the position of throttle stick higher than 10% from cut-throttle during the flight! In any
             control mode, DO NOT p ull throttle stick under 10% during nor mal flight without any reason.

(2) It is recommended to land the aircra ft slowly, to prevent the aircraft from damage when landing.

(3) If Low-Voltage Ala rm is set, the aircraft will act according to t he configuration of the Assistant
          Software once Low-Voltage Ala r m is triggered. Make sure you remember what you have set
          before.

(4) If Fail-Safe function is set, the aircraft w ill act according to the configuratio n of the Assistant
          Software once Fail-Safe is tr iggered. Make sure you r emember what you have set before.

 In order to p revent your multi-rotor from a crash o r other harmful consequences caused by low battery voltage,
 t her e ar e two levels of low voltage protectio n available to use. You can choose t o use or not to use them; however
 we str ongly recommend using the protections if available! Low-Vo ltage Alert is to indica te that t he battery cannot
 p rovide enough power for the aircraft, in order to warn you to land t he aircraft ASAP. You can configure th is
 function in the assistant software, and please read the text in the softwa re car efu lly before your flight. Make sure to
 ca rry out the Current Voltage Calibration.
 There are both first level and second level protections. The first level protection has LED warning. During second
 level protection the aircraft will land automatically w ith LED warning. Meanwhile the center point o f throttle stick
 will move up slowly to 90% of endpoint, you should land ASAP to prevent your aircraft from crashing!
 It is not for fun, you sho uld land you r ai rcraft ASAP to prevent your aircraft from cras hing or other harmful
consequences!!!

A3 Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) Flight (with GPS module)

Definition of Forward Direction:

Multi -roto r will fly along this direction w hen you push the elevator stick(. . .).

Step 1Before You Start

Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using IOC, wherever the
nose points, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction. The red and blue arrows o n the tra nsmitter

are co rresponding to pitch and roll operations in the fol lowi ng diagram.
· In course lock flying, the forward direction is the same as a recorded nose direction. A ll the following

          requirements are met: the autopilot system is in A TTl. Mode or GPS ATTl. Mode.

              Normal flying                                Course Lock Flying

e In home lock flying, the forward direction is the same as the direction from home point to multi -rotor. All the

following requireme nt s are met: 6 or more GPS sate llites are found, in GPS A TT l. Mode, and the aircraft is

further than 10m away from the home point.

                                                                 ~~

IOC FLYING NOTES ! ! !

           (1) When Multi-rotor is flying by home lock far away from you and the home point, please DO NOT

0 toggle the IOC switch many times q uickly so as to avoid the change of home point without your

        attention.

(l) Home lock flying requires that 6 or more GPS satellites are found and the aircraft is furthe r t han

        10m away from the home point.

(2) If the IOC flying r equirement is not satisfied, the autopi lot system w ill quit IOC contro l mode.

., (l)  Please be aware of the LED indicator, to know the current contro l mode of the autopilot system.

        Blinking indications o f IOC 0 0 are:
             a) Before motors start: 0 0 blink, all sticks (except thrott le stick) return to center;
                   0 00 blink, stick(s) (except throttle stick) not at center.
             0b) After motors start and throttle stick is over 10% in 3 seconds: 0 blink, all sticks

                 return t o center; 0 0 0 blink, stick(s) not at center.

(2) Before you do the home lock flight, you have to fly the aircraft out of the 10m range around

        home point, and then flip the IOC switch to Home Lock position to fly in home lock when all the

        requirements are met. If you have already toggled the IOC switch to Home Lock position when

        the aircraft is still in 10m range around home point, and this is the first time you are going to fly

        in home lock during the current flight, then if all the requiremen ts are met, the main contro ller

        wil l change into ho me lock automatically when Multi-rotor flies out t he 10m range around home

        point.
        (l) When flying in Home Lock mode, if any of the following situations happen, then the

                   system w ill quit Home Lock flying and automatically enter Cour se Lock flying. The aircraft
                   w ill fly in Course Lock using the earlier forward direction.

              a) The aircraft fly's within 10m range of the home point.
              b) You toggle the control mode switch to t he ATTl. Mode.
              c) The GPS signal b ecomes bad (The GPS signal LED is blinking Red t wice or th ree

                         times).
        (2) We suggest that you should know clearly which flight lock method you are going to fly,

                  and you know the locked forward direction o r hom e po int, before you switch on IOC
                  mode during the flight.

 A4 Receiver Advanced Protection Function

  You are asked to enable this function by connecting to the Assistant Software, please set it at the section of
  Basic->R/C-> Receiver Advanced Protection.
  If you choose enable it, the FailSafe will be triggered if the following situations occur during flight.
  According to the difference of the aircraft height, there are two situations.
  a) Lower than lOOm, the A/E/R channel is not at the mid point.
  b) Higher than lOOm, the A/E/R channel is not at the mid point or the throttle stick is above the mid point.
  In the GPS Node or ATTl. Node, if the requirement a) or b) is satisfied, and the output data of four channels
 A/E/R/T have not changed for 20 seconds, then the aircraft will hover automatically. After that, if the output data
 of four channels A/E/R/T still do not any changes and last for 10 seconds, the autopilot system will think that the
 data from receiver is abnormal, and then enter the FailSafe Mode.
 Brief introduction of how to quit the FailSafe Mode
 If there is any command change from the receiver, the autopilot system thinks that the receiver is regained. In ATTL
 Mode and Manual Mode, it will quit the FailSafe Mode automatically. In GPS Mode, please toggle the control mode
 switch to the ATTl. Mode and Manual Mode position to regain the control. Refer to the FailSafe section for more
 details.

AS Flight Limits

The flight limits function is default enabled in the NAZA-M Flight control system, it's aimed to restrict the flying
height and distance of the aircraft. The Max Height restricts the vertical distance between the aircraft and t he
Home point, the Max Radius restricts the horizontal distance between the aircraft and the Home point.
The default Max Height is 2000m and Max Radius is 2000m. Users can write the values of the Max Height and Max
Radius in the Assistant software, the range of the Max Height is lOm -l OOOOOm, the range of the Max Radius is the
same. So that the aircraft will fly in the entered range, which is a cylinder space above the Home point.

                                                                  Max

                                                                                           Height

                                          -- - ---

                 (1) Height limit works w hen the control mode is GPS or ATTl. Mode. Radius limit works when the
                            control mode is GPS and the satellite number <:!6.

                  (2) If the aircraft flies out of the limits, it's still controllable except flying further away.
                   (3) If the control mode is c hanged to GPS when the aircraft is out of Max Radius, the aircraft will fly

                             back within the entered range.
                   (4) The Failsafe and the Ground Station operations are not restricted to the Flight Limits.

FAQ

Abnormal LED Indication List

During the Checking Procedure, if abnormal LED Indica to r occurs or even t he system cannot wo r k normally, please
refer to the following list and aids troubleshooting.

(1) "System initializing and self-checking LED flashes" are not corr ect (e OOe OO& OOOOOO Red LED

          appears in the last four green flashes). The autopilot system works abnormally. Please contact your
          dealer.

(2) LED blinks Yellow 4 times quickly (0000 ). The system is warming up. You cannot start the motors until
          the 4 rapid yellow flash es disappear. If the warm up waiting is longer than 2 minutes, please power off for
         5 minutes, cold sta rt, and then connect the assistant software, enter the "Too ls" - > IMU calibration, carry
          out the Adva nced calibration.

(3) After the system start and self·checking has finished, if the LED blinks Red , G reen and Yellow (0 0 0 )
          continually. Sensor error is too big. Please connect the assistant software, enter the "Tools" - · IMU
         ca libration, carry out calibration.

(4) At the first motors start, the system will check the sensors Bias and you are asked to keep the aircraft
          stationary (no need of horizontal level). If you ca nnot start the motors and the LED blinks Green 6 times
          quickly (000000 ), it means that the sensor error is too big. Please connect the assistant software,
          enter the "Tools"- · IMU calibration, carry out basic calibration.
          Note: after the first successful motors start, this checking will be disabled and it is no need any more to
          keep the aircraft stationary during starting motors.

(5) The system blinks Red LED quickly during flying. Low-voltage protection is triggered. Please land t he
          aircraft ASAP.

(6) The system blinks Yellow LED quickly during flying. FailSafe Mode is triggered. Pay attention that there is

no tall buildings and trees to block your aircraft during go-home.

(7) The LED blinks Red and Yellow alternately(-  ). Compass error is too b ig.

a) There may be a ferromagnetic substance close to the Phantom. Lift the air craft up about lm from

     the ground, if there is no Red and Yellow flashing, then it wi ll not affect the flight.

b) Otherwise, re-calibrate the compass.

c) If re-calibration does not work, please connect to the Assistant Software, select the "Tools" and

     follow the tips to carry out the required operation.

Fix the TBE (Toilet Bowl Effect) Problem

When flying in GPS ATTl. Mode and the compass calibration has been done correctly, should you find the aircraft
rotating (Toilet bowl effect), or drifting when hovering. Please check the GPS module mounting orientation and then

Ie2013 DJIInnovations. All Rights Reserved. 29
re-do the compass calibration. Carry out the following procedure to re-mount the GPS module.
In the following diagram (view from the top), the aircraft can appear to be rotating in both clockwise and
counter-clockwise direction, please re -mount the GPS module co rrespondingly.

.,- - ~ is the rotating direction of aircraft, ~ is the nose direction of aircraft,

· · · is the arrow direction on the GPS module, 0 is the offset angle for GPS r e-mo unting(about 10-30°)

                            /

 Should you find the multi-rotor does not track straight in forward flight.

 Please carry out several more courses, the system will fix it automatically.

 Motors Start failure caused by TX stick(s) midpoint error too big

  If the TX stick(s) mid point error is too big, Motors Start will fail when you execute the Combination Stick
  Commands (CSC) and lead to the aircraft will not takeoff.. And the LED w ill blink Red four t imes per second
  continually to warn you.
  TX stick(s) mid point error too big can be caused by the following reasons:

            (l) There is TX stick (except the throttle stick) not at center when power on the autopilot system.
             (2) The TX sticks has been trimmed, which leads to the large deviation of mid point. For example, the

                       SUB-TRIM has been adjusted for Futaba transmitter.
             (3) The TX stick(s) travel ha s larger asymmetry.
  For the reason (1), please put all TX sticks at the mid point, and t hen power cycle the autopilot system to
     re-record the mid point. If the problem continues, that can be caused by the reason (2) or reason (3), yo
   u need to adjust the output range of your TX, and then use the Assistant So ftware to redo the TX ca li
   bration. Please carry out the following procedures.
              (1) Connect to the Assistant software, click Basic-> R/C-> Command Sticks Calibration, and push all TX

                        sticks throughout their complete travel range to see if any stick cannot reach its largest position.
              (2) Adjust the largest travel of TX stick until the cursor on the Assistant software can reach both end

                        positions, according to your TX manual.
              (3) Power cycle the autopilot system, note that power cycle is requi red.
              (4) Redo the TX ca libration according to the Assistant software.

 Attitude Controllable When One Motor Output is Failed

   For Hexa-rotor, including Hexa-rotor I, Hexa-rotor V, Hexa-rotor IY and Hexa-rotor Y, aircraft is attitude controllable
   when one motor output is failed.
  The NAZA-M can still control the attitude of the Hexa-rotor for a safe landing when one motor output of the
   Hexa-rotor has failed, for example, one motor is stopped or one propeller is broken, etc.
  The control mode of NAZA-M should be in Atti. Mode or GPS Atti. Mode. The aircraft will rotate, due to an
  imbalance of torque; however, it can still be controlled by the Transmitter.
  Select Course lock or home lock mode for flying the aircraft into a safe area to land when the aircraft is far away or
  the attitude can't be recognized. Even when the multi rotor is rotating, using Course lock or home lock mode will
  allow you to move the multi rotor in the corresponding Transmitter stick direction.

When used with other DJIproducts

The NAZA-M system communicates with other DJI products (e.g. H3-2D gimbal, BTU module, iOSD mini and iOSD
Ma rk II) via the CAN -Bus port (c!.IF') of the NAZA PMU V2. You can plug new DJI products into any spare CAN-Bus
port, since CAN-Bus ports on NAZA-M, CAN HUB, GCU, iOSD mini, iOSD Mark II and 2.4G Bluetooth Datalink are

the same for the commun ications.
When there are not enough CAN·Bus ports for additional DJI products, then a DJ I CAN HUB module is

r ecommended. The following diagram is for your connection reference.

Operating a powered vehicle of any kind can be a lot of fun, but it carries certain inherent risks. Regu lations
governing the use of powered veh icles, including aircraft. vary from locale to locale, even within the same country
or district. It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand and comply with all local laws and regulations.

Safety basics:
  · Never operate the vehicle or software in a way that could be dangerous to you, other people, or property.
  · Always keep propeller arcs free of objects and body parts w hi le the vehicle is live,
  · Keep in mind that software and hardware failures happen. Although we design our products to minimize
     such issues, you should always operate with the understanding that a fai lure could occur at any time and
     without warning. Accordingly, you should take the appropriate precautions to minimize danger in case of
     product failure.
  · Never use the software or hardware for manned vehicles.
     Always operate within local laws and regulations.
     Do not operate the aircraft if you are under the age of 18.

Additional safety information:
  · Be sure to maintain safe distances between people and your aircraft.
  · Never operate your aircraft if your ability to do so with the utmost attention to safety is impaired in any
     way. Do not operate your aircraft while tired, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or otherwise unable to
     operate it with the highest attention to safety.
 · Environment conditions can change rapid ly and can make operat ion difficult. If this occurs, land your aircraft
     and discontinue use immediately. Do not operate your aircraft if operating conditions are not ideal. This
     includes, but is not limited to, rain, snow or excessive wind.
 · Always ensure the battery cable is disconnected from the aircraft until you are ready to fly, and ensure that
     your batteries are fully charged prior to use.
 · Always turn on the transmitter and ensure the throttle stick is all the way down before connecting the
     battery.
     After landing, disarm your vehicle immediately and disconnect the battery cable.
 · Do not turn off the transmitter until after you have disconnected the battery.
     Always remove the propellers while testing the motors.
     When the battery is connected, always assume the vehicle is live and the motors are armed .
 · Do not attempt to fly longer than the battery's safe capaci ty.
 · Do not operate the vehicle with excess weight attached.
 · Ensure that all vehicle components are well maintained before each flight. Ensure that components are
     firmly attached and operating properly.
     Replace any worn or damaged components before each flight. Never operate with any damaged or worn
     components.
 · SAFETY IS THE FIRST PRIORITY. Take all precautions necessary to ensure your own safety as well as the
     safety of other people and property.
