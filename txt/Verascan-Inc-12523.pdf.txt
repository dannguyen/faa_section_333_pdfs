                                                           Exemption No. 12523
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0986

Mr. Brett Kanda
Partner
Verascan Inc.
4600 Polaris Avenue
Las Vegas, NV 89103

Dear Mr. Kanda:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters posted to the public docket on April 13, 2015, and July 22, 2015, you petitioned the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on behalf of Verascan Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or
operator) for an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct aerial inspections, acquisitions, and research.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1 or/and closed set motion picture
and filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described
by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Verascan Inc. is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Verascan Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
              and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those

System  pursuant  to  Section  333  of  the  FAA  Modernization  and  Reform  Act  of  

2012  (FMRA).  This  exemption  will  permit  Verascan  Inc.  to  operate  a  DJI  

Phantom  2  for  the  commercial  purpose  of  conducting  aerial  inspections,  

acquisitions  and  research  within  the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS)  in  the  

industries  of  agriculture,  construction,  and  engineering.  

  

· Allowing  Verascan  to  commercially  operate  would  improve  efficiency  in  each  
    industry  because  of  strict  safety  protocols,  years  of  experience,  and  qualified  

pilots.    Eliminating  the  need  for  personnel  in  hazardous  environments  is  now  

possible  through  the  effective  operations  of  Verascan.    Verascan  is  located  in  

Las  Vegas,  which  has  multiple  advantages  including  being  firmly  planted  in  
         one  of  the  6  FAA  designated  test  sites.    Our  distinct  partnerships  with  UNLV,

Reasons  Why  An  Exemption  From  The  Requirements  Of  Section  61.113(a)  And  
(b)  Would  Not  Adversely  Affect  Safety:  Verascan  submits  that  the  equivalent  level  
of  safety  established  by  Section  61.1  DJI  Phantom  2  unless  that  PIC  has  
demonstrated,  through  the  DJI  Phantom  2  UAV  training  and  currency  requirements,  
that  the  PIC  is  able  to  safely  operate  the  DJI  Phantom  2  in  a  manner  consistent  with  
this  exemption,  including  evasive  and  emergency  maneuvers  and  maintaining  
appropriate  distances  from  people,  vessels,  vehicles  and  structures.  Considering  
Verascan's  proposed  area  of  operations,  and  the  operating  limitations  set  forth-
above;  the  parallel  nature  of  private  pilot  aeronautical  knowledge  requirements  to  
those  of  commercial  pilot  requirements  (See  Exemption  No.  11062);  and  the  
airmanship  skills  necessary  to  safely  operate  the  DJI  Phantom  2,  Verascan  submits  
that  the  additional  manned  airmanship  experience  of  a  commercially  certificated  
pilot  would  not  correlate  to  the  airmanship  skills  necessary  for  Verascan's  specific  
proposed  flight  operations.  Additionally,  the  FAA  has  previously  granted  relief  from  
Section  61.113(a)  and  (b)  specific  to  UAS,  in  circumstances  similar,  in  all  material  
respects,  to  those  presented  herein  (e.g.  Exemption  Nos.  11062,  11063,  11064,  
11065,  11066,  11067,  11080,  11109,  11110,  11112,  11136,  11138).  As  in  
Exemption  No.  11109,  Verascan  will  not  allow  any  PIC  to  operate  the  DJI  Phantom  2  
unless  that  PIC  has  demonstrated  through  the  DJI  Phantom  2  UAV  training  and  
currency  requirements,  that  the  PIC  is  able  to  safely  operate  the  DJI  Phantom  2  UAV  
in  a  manner  consistent  with  this  exemption,  including  evasive  and  emergency  
maneuvers  and  maintaining  appropriate  distances  from  people,  vessels,  vehicles  
and  structures.  A  complete  description  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2  Training  and  
Qualification  requirements  is  set  forth  in  the  attached  Operations  Manual.  
Operations  Manual  contains  proprietary  information  and  is  to  be  held  in  a  separate  
file  pursuant  to  14  C.F.R.  §  11.35(b).    
Reasons  Why  An  Exemption  From  The  Requirements  Of  Section  91.7(a)  Would  
Not  Adversely  Affect  Safety:  The  equivalent  level  of  safety  established  by  Section  
91.7(a)  will  be  maintained  because  prior  to  every  flight,  Verascan  will  ensure  that  
the  DJI  Phantom  2  is  in  an  airworthy  condition  based  upon  the  aircraft's  conformity  
to  its  type  design,  including  compliance  with  its  operating  documents  (i.e.,  the  DJI  
Phantom  2  User  Manual  and  the  DJI  Phantom  2  Maintenance  Manual),  and  that  the  
UAV  is  in  a  condition  for  safe  flight,  as  stated  in  the  conditions  and  limitations  
contained  herein.      
Reasons  Why  An  Exemption  From  The  Requirements  Of  Section  91.121  Would  
Not  Adversely  Affect  Safety:  The  equivalent  level  of  safety  established  by  Section  
91.121  will  be  maintained  because  the  altitude  information  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2  
will  be  provided  to  the  PIC  via  GPS  equipment  and  a  radio  communications  
telemetry  data  link,  which  downlinks  from  the  UAV  to  the  GCS  for  active  monitoring  
of  the  flight  path  and  altitude.  This  altitude  information,  combined  with  Verascan's  
operation  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2  within  visual  line  of  sight,  at  or  below  400  feet  AGL,  
will  ensure  a  level  of  safety  equivalent  to  Section  91.121.  The  altitude  information  
will  be  generated  by  GPS  equipment  installed  onboard  the  aircraft.  Prior  to  each  
flight,  a  zero  altitude  initiation  point  is  automatically  established  by  the  UAV.  The  
FAA  has  previously  granted  relief  from  Section  91.121  specific  to  UAV,  in  
circumstances  similar,  in  all  material  respects,  to  those  presented  herein  (e.g.  
Exemption  Nos.  11062,  11063,  11064,  11065,  11066,  11067,  11080,  11109,  11112,  
11136,  11138).      
Reasons  Why  An  Exemption  From  The  Requirements  Of  Section  91.151(b)  
Would  Not  Adversely  Affect  Safety:  A  grant  of  this  exemption  would  ensure  an  
equivalent  level  of  safety  established  by  14  C.F.R.  Section  91.151(b)  as  a  result  of  (1)  
the  technical  specifications  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2;  (2)  the  limitations  on  the  proposed  
flight  operations;  and  (3)  the  location  of  the  proposed  flight  operations.  Accordingly,  
Verascan  will  ensure  that  it  will  safely  operate  the  battery  powered  DJI  Phantom  2  
during  daylight  hours  in  VMC  conditions,  under  VFR,  with  enough  battery  power  to  
fly  for  a  total  duration  of  15  minutes  to  the  first  point  of  intended  landing  and,  
assuming  normal  cruising  speed,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  least  five  minutes  (i.e.,  25  
percent  battery  power  remaining).  Similar  to  the  FAA's  Grant  of  Exemption  No.  
11109,  AgScan  hereby  submits  that  the  technical  specifications  of  the  DJI  Phantom  
2;  the  limitations  on  the  proposed  flight  operations;  and  the  location  of  the  
proposed  operations,  will  ensure  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  established  by  14  
C.F.R.  Section  91.151(b).  Furthermore,  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  ensured  
as  the  DJI  Phantom  2  provides  audible  and  visual  warnings  to  the  PIC  at  the  GCS  
when  the  UA  reaches  20  percent  and  10  percent  of  battery  power  remaining.  
Significantly,  previous  exemptions  granted  by  the  FAA  concerning  Section  91.151  
establish  that  safety  is  not  adversely  affected  when  the  technical  characteristics  and  
operating  limitations  of  the  UAS  are  considered.  Relief  has  been  granted  for  manned  
aircraft  to  operate  at  less  than  the  minimums  prescribed  in  Section  91.151,  
including  Exemption  Nos.  2689,  5745,  and  10650.  Moreover,  the  FAA  has  previously  
granted  relief  from  Section  91.151  specific  to  UAS,  in  circumstances  similar,  in  all  
material  respects,  to  those  presented  herein  (e.g.  Exemption  Nos.  8811,  10808,  
10673,  11042,  11062,  11063,  11064,  11065,  11066,  11067,  11080,  11109,  11110,  
11136,  11138).  30    
Reasons  Why  An  Exemption  From  The  Requirements  Of  Sections  91.405(a),  
91.407(a)(1),  91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  And  91.417(a)  &  (b)  Would  Not  Adversely  
Affect  Safety:  In  seeking  this  exemption,  Verascan  submits  that  an  equivalent  level  
of  safety  with  regard  to  the  regulatory  maintenance  and  alteration  requirements  
established  by  Sections  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(1),  91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  and  
91.417(a)  &  (b)  will  be  met  because  Verascan  will  use  manufacturer  trained  
technicians  to  perform  maintenance,  alterations,  or  preventive  maintenance  on  the  
UAS  using  the  methods,  techniques,  and  practices  prescribed  in  the  manufacturer's  
maintenance  manual.  Furthermore,  Verascan  will  document  and  maintain  all  
maintenance  records  for  the  DJI  Phantom  2.  Since  the  DJI  Phantom  2  will  be  
inspected  as  prescribed  by  the  manufacturer's  maintenance  manual,  Verascan  will  
maintain  the  equivalent  level  of  safety  established  by  Sections  91.405(a),  
91.409(a)(1),  and  91.409(a)(2).  The  DJI  Phantom  2  System  Operations  Manual  sets  
forth  airworthiness  requirements  for  the  UA,  including  preflight  inspections,  as  well  
as  scheduled  maintenance  after  every  three  months,  every  year  or  300  flight  hours  
(whichever  comes  first),  and  after  every  600-flight  hours.  Likewise,  the  exemption  
sought  will  not  adversely  affect  safety  because  Verascan  will  use  manufacturer  
trained  technicians  to  perform  maintenance,  alterations  or  preventive  maintenance  
on  the  UAS  using  the  methods,  techniques,  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  
manufacturer's  maintenance  manual.  The  DJI  Phantom  2  Operations  Manual  details  
procedures  for  inspection,  firmware  upgrades,  motor  testing,  and  motor  
replacement.  A  complete  description  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2  maintenance  
requirements  is  set  forth  in  the  DJI  Phantom  2  Operations  Manual,  which  is  
attached.  Attached  Operations  Manual  contains  proprietary  information  and  is  to  be  
held  in  a  separate  file  pursuant  to  14  C.F.R.  §  11.35(b).  Furthermore,  the  exemption  
sought  would  maintain  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  established  by  Sections  91.407,  
91.417(a)  and  91.417(b),  because  all  maintenance  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2  will  be  
performed  by  manufacturer  trained  technicians,  which  will  document  and  maintain  
maintenance  records  for  the  UAS.  Significantly,  previous  exemptions  granted  by  the  
FAA  concerning  the  DJI  Phantom  2  and  Sections  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(1),  
91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  and  91.417(a)  &  (b)  establish  that  safety  is  not  adversely  
affected  when  the  technical  characteristics  and  operating  limitations  of  the  UAS  are  
DJI  Phantom  2  Operations  Manual,  and  the  technical  aspects  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2  
Verascan  submits  that  safety  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  granting  exemption  
from  14  C.F.R.  Sections  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(1)  and  (a)(2),  91.409(a)(2),  and  
91.417(a)  and  (b).  The  FAA  has  previously  granted  relief  specific  to  UAS  in  
circumstances  similar,  in  all  material  respects,  to  those  presented  herein  (e.g.  
Exemption  Nos.  11062,  11063,  11064,  11065,  11066,  11067,  11080,  11109,  11110,  
11112,  11136,  11138).  7.  The  FAA  May  Prescribe  Any  Other  Conditions  For  Safe  
Operation.  In  accordance  with  Section  333  of  the  FAA  Modernization  and  Reform  
Act  of  2012  (FMRA)  and  14  C.F.R.  §  21.16  entitled  Special  Conditions,  Verascan  
requests  that  the  FAA  prescribe  special  conditions  for  the  intended  operation  of  the  
DJI  Phantom  2,  which  contain  such  safety  standards  that  the  Administrator  finds  
necessary  to  establish  a  level  of  safety  equivalent  to  that  established  by  14  C.F.R.  
Part  21,  Subpart  H,  and  14  C.F.R  §§  61.113(a)  &  (b),  91.7  (a),  91.121,  91.151(b),  
91.405(a),  91.407(a)(1),  91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  and  91.417(a)  &  (b).  2  Such  special  
conditions  will  permit  Verascan's  safe  operation  of  the  UA  for  the  limited  purpose  of  
conducting  aerial  acquisitions  over  certain  rural  areas  of  the  United  States  for  
compensation  or  hire.  FMRA  Section  333  sets  forth  the  requirements  for  
considering  whether  a  UAS  will  create  a  hazard  to  users  of  the  NAS  or  the  public,  or  
otherwise  pose  a  threat  to  national  security;  and  further,  provides  the  authority  for  
such  UAS  to  operate  without  airworthiness  certification  in  accordance  with  any  
requirements  that  must  be  established  for  the  safe  operation  of  the  UAS  in  the  NAS.  
Likewise,  the  Administrator  may  prescribe  special  conditions  pursuant  to  14  C.F.R.  §  
21.16,  for  operation  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2,  since  the  airworthiness  regulations  of  14  
C.F.R.  Part  21  do  not  contain  adequate  or  appropriate  safety  standards,  due  to  the  
novel  or  unusual  design  features  of  the  aircraft.  Section  21.16,  entitled  Special  
Conditions,  states  the  following:  If  the  FAA  finds  that  the  airworthiness  regulations  
of  this  subchapter  do  not  contain  adequate  or  appropriate  safety  standards  for  an  
aircraft,  aircraft  engine,  or  propeller  because  of  a  novel  or  unusual  design  feature  of  
the  aircraft,  aircraft  engine  or  propeller,  he  prescribes  special  conditions  and  
amendments  thereto  for  the  product.  The  special  conditions  are  issued  in  
accordance  with  Part  11  of  this  chapter  and  contain  such  safety  standards  for  the  
aircraft,  aircraft  engine  or  propeller  as  the  FAA  finds  necessary  to  establish  a  level  of  
safety  equivalent  to  that  established  in  the  regulations.  See  14  C.F.R.  §  21.16.  
Therefore,  in  accordance  with  FMRA  Section  333  and  14  C.F.R.  §  21.16,  the  FAA  may  
prescribe  special  conditions  for  Verascan's  intended  operation  of  the  DJI  Phantom  2,  
which  contain  such  safety  standards  that  the  Administrator  finds  necessary  to  
establish  a  level  of  safety  equivalent  to  that  established  by  14  C.F.R.  Part  21,  Subpart  
H,  and  14  C.F.R  Sections  61.113(a)  &  (b),  91.7(a),  91.121,  91.151(b),  91.405(a),  
91.407(a)(1),  91.409(a)(1)  &  (a)(2),  and  91.417(a)  &  (b).  
  
  
The  extent  to  which  we  seek  relief  from  the  listed  sections  is  described  in  the  
attached  "Verascan  Operations  Manual  for  a  DJI  Phantom  2."

14  C.F.R.  §  61.113:  Private  Pilot  Privileges  and  Limitations  
  
Verascan  Inc.  seeks  exemption  from  14  CFR  §  61.113,  which  restricts  private  pilots  
from  flying  aircraft  for  compensation  or  hire  and  would  also  require  a  second  class  
medical  certificate.  The  purpose  of  Part  61  is  to  ensure  that  the  skill  and  competency  
of  any  PIC  matches  the  airspace  in  which  the  PIC  will  be  operating,  as  well  as  
requiring  certifications  if  the  pilot  is  
carrying  passengers  or  cargo  for  hire.  While  the  UAS  will  be  operated  as  part  of  a  
commercial  operation,  they  carry  neither  
passengers  nor  cargo.  In  the  Grant  of  Exemption  in  FAA  Docket  No.  FAA-2015-0986,  
the  FAA  determined  that  the  unique  characteristics  of  UAS  operation  outside  of  
controlled  airspace  did  not  warrant  the  additional  cost  and  restrictions  attendant  
with  requiring  the  PIC  to  have  a  commercial  pilot  certificate  and  a  class  II  medical  
certificate.  The  FAA  has  also  determined  that  the  required  knowledge  for  a  
commercial  pilot  covers  the  same  fundamental  principles  as  a  private  pilot.  The  FAA  
has  also  granted  exemptions  allowing  operations  by  people  who  hold  an  airline  
transport,  commercial,  private,  recreational,  or  sport  pilot  certificate  with  a  current  
FAA  airman  medical  certificate  or  a  valid  U.S.  driver's  license  issued  by  a  state  or  the  
Federal  
Government.  The  PIC  must  also  meet  the  flight  review  requirements  specified  in  14  
CFR  §  61.56.  See  FAA  Exemption  No.  11374.  Verascan  will  ensure  the  PIC  will  meet  
the  requirements  listed  in  the  above  paragraph.  Verascan  will  also  ensure  the  PIC  
will  have  completed  the  manufacturers'  training  guidelines  outlined  in  the  Manuals.  
The  FAA  stated  in  its  grant  of  an  exception  to  Astraeus  Aerial  the  "the  FAA  considers  
the  overriding  safety  factor  for  the  limited  operations  proposed  by  the  petitioner  to  
be  the  airmanship  skills  acquired  through  VAS-specific  flight  cycles,  flight  time,  and  
specific  make  
and  model  experience,  culminating  in  verification  through  testing."  The  restrictions  
Verascan  has  placed  on  its  UAS  operations  meet  or  exceed  the  restrictions  similarly  
imposed  on  Astraeus  Aerial  in  FAA  Docket  No.  F  AA-20  14-0352  and  those  listed

Verascan  seeks  an  exemption  from  14  C.P.R.§  91.7(a),  which  requires  that  a  civil  
aircraft  be  in  airworthy  condition  to  be  operated.  The  FAA  has  stated  that  no  
exemption  is  required  to  the  extent  that  the  requirements  of  Part  21  are  waived  or  
found  inapplicable.  Accordingly,  Verascan  requests  that  the  requirements  for  
Section  91.7  be  treated  in  accordance  with  FAR  
Part  21  Subpart  H.  See  Grant  of  Exemption  No.  11062  
  
14  C.F.R.  §  91.121:  Altimeter  Settings  
  
This  petition  seeks  an  exemption  from  14  C.F.R.  §  91.121,  which  requires  a  person  
operating  an  aircraft  to  maintain  cruising  altitude  or  flight  level  by  reference  to  an  
altimeter  that  is  set  to  the  elevation  of  the  departure  airport.  The  UASs  proposed  
here  use  both  barometricpressure  sensors  and  GPS  to  determine  altitude  but  do  not  
have  the  ability  to  set  in  a  current  altimeter  setting.  An  exemption  is  required  to  the  
extent  that  the  UAS  does  not  have  a  barometric  altimeter  setting.  The  altitude  of  the  
UAS  is  monitored  by  the  PIC  on  the  ground  control  station  and  by  the  visual  
observer.  
  
Extent  and  Reason  for  Which  Relief  is  Sought:  The  FAA  has  stated  that  an  equivalent  
level  of  safety  can  be  achieved  if  the  aircraft  will  be  operated  at  or  below  400  feet  
AGL  and  within  visual  line-of  sight  in  addition  to  GPS  based  altitude  information  
relayed  in  real  time  to  the  operator.  See  Grant  of  Exemption  No.  11062,  p.  20-21.  As  
the  attached  Manuals  indicate,  the  UAS  will  be  operated  at  or  below  400  feet  AGL  
and  otherwise  comply  with  the  limitations  in  the  Grant  of  Exemption  No.  11062.    
  
14  C.F.R.  §  91.151(a):  Fuel  Requirements  for  Flight  in  VFR  Conditions  
  
Verascan  requests  an  exemption  from  14  C.F.R.  §  91.15l(a)'s  fuel  requirements  for  
flight  in  VFR  conditions.  Section  91.151  states:  
(a)  No  person  may  begin  a  flight  in  an  airplane  under  VFR  conditions  unless  
(considering  wind  and  forecast  weather  conditions)  there  is  enough  fuel  to  fly  to  the  
first  point  of  intended  landing  and,  assuming  normal  cruising  speed  -(1)  During  the  
day,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  least  30  minutes;  or  (2)  At  night,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  
least  45  minutes.  Here,  the  technological  limitations  on  the  UAS  battery  power  
means  that  no  meaningful  flight  operations  can  be  conducted  while  maintaining  a  
30  minute  reserve.  The  aircraft  are  battery  powered  with  a  maximum  flight  time  of  
approximately  24  minutes  for  the  Phantom  2.  The  PIC  will  ensure  that  before  each  
flight,  there  is  enough  available  power  for  the  UAS  to  conduct  the  intended  
operation  and  to  operate  after  that  for  at  least  five  minutes  or  with  the  reserve  
power  recommended  by  the  manufacturer  if  greater.  
  
Extent  and  Reason  for  Which  Relief  is  Sought:  The  FAA  has  stated  that  an  equivalent  
level  of  safety  is  provided  if  the  UAS  flight  is  conducted  under  daytime  VFR  flight  
conditions  using  VLOS,  and  terminated  with  at  least  25%  reserve  battery  power  still  
available.  See  Grant  of  Exemption  No.  11062.  The  FAA's  "summary  grant"  process  
provides  that  the  PIC  is  prohibited  from  beginning  a  flight  unless  there  is  enough  
available  power  to  conduct  the  intended  operation  and  to  operate  after  that  for  at  
least  five  minutes  or  with  the  reserve  power  recommended  by  the  manufacturer  if  
greater.  See  FAA  Exemption  No.  11374  (FAA  Docket  No.  2015-0091  at  p.  5).  The  
Manuals  here  provide  that  the  PIC  will  ensure  that  before  each  flight,  there  is  
enough  available  power  for  the  UAS  to  conduct  the  intended  operation  and  to  
operate  after  that  for  at  least  five  minutes  or  with  the  reserve  power  recommended  
by  the  manufacturer  if  greater.    
  
14  C.F.R.  §§  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(l),  91.409(a)(1)(a)(2);  91.417(a)  and  (b):  
Maintenance  Inspections  
  
Verascan  seeks  an  exemption  from  the  maintenance  inspection  requirements  
contained  in  14  C.P.R.§  91.405(a),  91.407(a)(l),  91.409(a)(2);  91.417(a)  and  (b).  
These  regulations  specify  maintenance  and  inspection  standards  in  reference  to  14  
C.P.R.  Part  43.  See,  e.g.,  14  C.P.R.§  91.405(a)  (stating  that  each  owner  or  operator  of  
an  aircraft  "[s]hall  have  the  aircraft  inspected  as  prescribed  in  subpart  E  of  this  part  
and  shall  between  required  inspections  ...  have  discrepancies  repaired  as  prescribed  
in  part  43  of  this  chapter").  An  exemption  from  these  regulations  is  needed  because  
Part  43  and  these  sections  only  apply  to  aircraft  with  an  airworthiness  certificate,  
which  the  UAS  proposed  here  will  not  have.  
  
Extent  and  Reason  for  Which  Relief  is  Sought:  An  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  
achieved  because  maintenance  and  inspections  will  be  performed  in  accordance  
with  the  Manuals.  This  includes  maintenance,  overhaul,  replacement,  and  preflight  
inspection  requirements.  See  Exemption  No.  11062  (FAA  Docket  No.  2014-0352,  
atp.  14-15)  and  Exemption  No.  11374  (FAA  Docket  No.  2015-0091,  at  p.  4).    
Verascan  will  follow  the  UAS  manufacturer's  maintenance  requirements.  As  
provided  in  the  attached  Operations  Manual,  flights  will  not  be  conducted  unless  a  
flight  operations  checklist  is  performed  that  includes  all  of  the  aircraft's  
components.
