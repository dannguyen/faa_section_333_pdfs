                                                           Exemption No. 12745
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­2528

Ms. Terra S. Merriman
SkyLens LLC dba Film and Flight
14 Court Theophelia
Saint Augustine, FL 32084

Dear Ms. Merriman:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of SkyLens LLC dba Film and Flight (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial photography and videography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 3 and DJI Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, SkyLens LLC dba Film and Flight is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, SkyLens LLC dba Film and Flight is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3 and
         DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
                                                                                                            4

    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

        Petition of SkyLens LLC dba Film and Flight for Exemption Pursuant to Section
        333 ofthe FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012.

   To Whom It May Concern:

   Pursuant to Section 333 ofthe FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012 and 14 CFR
   Part 11, SkyLens LLC, dba Film and Flight, hereby applies for exemption from the
   aforementioned Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) to allow commercial operation of
   its Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs).

   This exemption is in accordance with the conditions outlined herein, the enclosed Film

   and  Fli~ht  General  Operations  Manual  1   DJI  UAS  User's  Manuals,  DJI  Quick  Start
                                              ,

   Guides , and all other requirements established by the FAA pursuant to Section 333 of

   the Modernization and Reform Act.

   This exemption would allow SkyLens LLC to perform commercial operations using DJI
   Phantom 3 and DJI Inspire 1 UAS for the purposes of aerial photography and
   videography. These operations would be operated in airspace that is 1) limited 2)
   predetermined 3) has controlled access and 4) would provide safety enhancements to the
   already safe operations in the film and television industry using conventional aircraft.

   The name and address of the applicant is:

   1 SkyLens LLC is submitting its General Operations Manual (GOM) as a confidential
   document under 14 CFR35(b), the entire content of the GOM contains confidential
   commercial and proprietary information that SkyLens has not and will not share with
   others. This manual contains operating procedures that are not available to the public and
   are protected from release under the Freedom oflnformation Act, 5 USC § 552 (b) (4).

       SkyLens LLC. Exemption Request 1
         SkyLens LLC's UAS are multi rotor aircraft, weighting less than 55 lbs. including
payload. They operate, under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 100 mph and
have the capability to hover, and move in the vertical and horizontal plane
simultaneously. They will operate only in line of sight and will operate only within the
sterile area described in the Film and Flight General Operating Manual, (hereinafter
"GOM"). Such operations will insure that the UAS will "not create a hazard to users of
the national airspace system or the public".

         Given the small size of the UAS involved and the restricted sterile environment
within which they will operate, the applicant falls squarely within that zone of safety (an
equivalent level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by
exemption, allow commercial operations ofUASs to commence immediately. Also due
to the size of the UASs and the restricted areas in which the relevant UAS will operate,
approval of the application presents no national security issue. Given the clear direction
in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal Aviation Act, as
amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and
the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental
impacts, including reduced emissions associated with allowing UASs aerial filming, the
grant of the requested exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly, the applicant
respectfully requests that the FAA grant the requested exemption without delay.

SkyLens LLC's GOM provides procedures and limitation under which the operator will
be bound by. These limitations provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of
safety to operations under the current regulatory structure because the proposed
operations represent a safety enhancement to the already safe aerial filming operations
conducted with conventional aircraft.

The limitations and conditions to which SkyLens LLC agrees to be bound when
conducting commercial operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

     1. Minimum crew will consist of a PIC and a Visual Observer (VO).

     2. All operations will be conducted under daytime VFR conditions.

     3. Flights will be operated within Visual Line Of Sight (VLOS) ofthe PIC and VO.

     4. If the PIC or VO lose sight of the UAS, the PIC will immediately active the
         "return to home" function of the aircraft.

     5. Pilot in Command and Visual Observer will at all times be able to communicate
         by voice.

     6. Prior to flight the PIC will insure there is enough available power for the UAS to
         conduct the intended operation and to operate thereafter for at least five minutes
         or the reserve power recommended by the manufacturer whichever is if greater.

     7. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.

     SkyLens LLC. Exemption Request 2
8. All Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:

              A) Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect
    nonparticipating persons from the UAS and/or debris in the event of an accident.
    The operator will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such
    protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such
    protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight operations will cease
    immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of nonparticipating persons; and

              B) The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
    permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety
    assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it
    does not present an undue hazard.

9. The UAS will operate only within a confined "Sterile Area" as defined in the
    GOM.

10. In accordance with the GOM a briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned
    UAS operations prior to each day's missions. It will be mandatory that all
    personnel who will be performing duties within the boundaries of the sterile area
    be present for this briefing.

11. In the event of an accident involving a Film and Flight UAS, the PIC will
    immediately cease operations and report the accident to the NTSB and AFS-80.

12. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state,
    county or city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire or other
    appropriate governmental agencies.

13. Contingency plans will be in place to safely terminate flight if there is a loss of
    communication between the PIC, the VO, or the UAS.

14. Procedures have been established in Film and Flight's GOM to contact ATC prior
    to operating in the National Airspace System (NAS).

Many previous cases have set precedent in which the FAA has granted relief from the
listed FARs (See: Nos 11062, Nos 11109, Nos 11112, and Nos 11213). Since SkyLens
LLC falls squarely within the already established zone for exemption, and would not set a
precedent for exemption from the listed FARs, they will forgo elaboration of the FAR
definitions and necessary reasons for exemption.

   1. Introduction

   The General Operations Manual (GOM) has been developed by SKYLENS LLC dba
   FILM AND FLIGHT in conjunction with an application for exemption under section 333
   of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012 for the purpose of aerial filming. The
   policies, procedures, and conditions contained within this manual shall be followed at all
   times during operations that require a section 333 exemption.

   2. Aircraft

   Film and Flight utilizes DJI Phantom 3 and DJI Inspire 1 UAS for aerial filming and
   photography.

   2.1. DJI Phantom 3

   2.1.1. Description
   The Phantom 3 (P3) is a Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS). The aircraft's weight
   including battery is 1280g (2.82lbs). The dimensions of the P3 are
   28.9cmX28.9cmX18.5cm (LxWxH). The P3 is a multirotor aircraft consisting of four
   propellers driven by four independent brushless electrical motors. Electrical power is
   provided by an interchangeable Intelligent Flight Battery (PH3-4480), which powers the
   motors, camera, onboard flight controller and all other electric components. The P3 has
   the capability to move along the vertical and horizontal planes as well as hover in
   position. The P3 contains a Ground Positioning System (GPS) receiver as well as Visual
   Positioning technology that allows it to follow precise tracks both indoors (via visual
   positioning) as well as outdoors (via GPS). Attached to the bottom of the P3 is a 3-Axis
   gimbal containing a small High Definition (HD) camera. The camera is capable of
   recording 4K video as well as taking still images. In addition, the camera transmits a live
   video feed back to sUAS operator. The P3 is controlled by a hand held Remote
   Controller. The Remote Control operates in the frequency range between 2.400 GHz and
   2.483 GHz, and has a maximum transmission distance of 2km (outdoors and
   unobstructed). In addition to the remote controller, advanced settings and controls can be
   accessed via the DJI pilot app on a connected tablet. In the event the P3 loses
   communication or its GPS signal, it has the ability to return to a predetermined position
   within the Area of Operation. Both the P3 as well as the Remote Controller have been

               a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating
                    persons from the UAS and/or debris in the event of an accident. The
                    operator will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such
                    protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such

Date: 5.25.2015  10 Revision: Original
                   protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight operations will cease
                   immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of nonparticipating persons;
                   and
              b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
                   permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a
                   safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and
                   determined that it does not present an undue hazard.

    9. The UAS will operate only within a confined "Sterile Area" as defined in the
         GOM.

     10. In accordance with the GOM a briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned
         UAS operations prior to each day's missions. It will be mandatory that all
         personnel who will be performing duties within the boundaries of the sterile area
         be present for this briefing.

    11. In the event of an accident involving a Film and Flight UAS, the PIC will
         immediately cease operations and report the accident to the NTSB and AFS-80.

     12. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state,
         county or city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire or other
         appropriate governmental agencies.

     13. Contingency plans will be in place to safely terminate flight if there is a loss of
         communication between the PIC, the VO, or the UAS.

     14. Procedures have been established in Film and Flight's GOM to contact ATC prior
         to operating in the National Airspace System (NAS).

7. Weather

Prior to each flight, the PIC will check the weather to insure that current and forecast
conditions will allow for the safe operation of the UAS. Approved sources of weather
include aviationweather.gov, WSI Pilotbrief, and any other source that would provide an
equivalent level of weather information. The following conditions present a danger to
operations and prohibit the initiation of a flight mission:

         Wind gusts that exceed the UAS's recommended limits.
         Rain
         Snow

                    A.2 Visual Observer Briefing Guide

                        Film and Flight is pleased to have you serving as a Visual Observer on todays flight
                        mission. This guide will serve as your Visual Observer familiarization and briefing guide,
                        so please read it carefully. We are happy to provide additional information should you
                        have any questions.

                        As a Visual Observer, your responsibility is to assist the PIC (Pilot In Command) in their
                        duties associated with collision avoidance. In other words, you are going to serve as a
                        second set of eyes and make sure the pilot doesn't hit anything! This includes, but is not
                        limited to, avoidance of other traffic (aircraft), clouds, obstructions and terrain.

                        The only requirement to serve as a Visual Observer is that you possess a current driver's
                        license and have the ability to visually observe the unmanned aircraft in flight
                        (Prescription glasses or contacts must be warn if required). Additionally during
                        operations in bright sunlight we highly recommend that sunglasses are warn.

                        All we ask of you during the operation is that you provide your full and undivided
                        attention to watching the unmanned aircraft. Your participation is very important so we
                        ask that you refrain from all unrelated distractions during the flight mission.

                        If during the operation you see any obstacles (other aircraft, clouds, buildings, terrain,
                        etc.), immediately inform the pilot using the following format:

                             a) Obstacle description
                             b) Obstacles position in relation to the unmanned aircraft (ahead, to the left, to the

                                 right, behind.)

                      Example: ifyou see a tall tree that the unmanned aircraft is headed towards, call out:

                             "Tall tree (obstacle description), straight ahead (obstacle position)!"

                        Please feel free to speak up at any time if you have any questions or concerns regarding
                        the operation. You are part of the team, and there is no such thing as a silly question.

                        We hope you enjoy the experience, and thank you for your participation in todays flight
                        mission!
