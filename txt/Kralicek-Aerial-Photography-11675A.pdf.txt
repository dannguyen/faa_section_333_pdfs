                                                      Exemption No. 11675A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0713

Owner

Denton, TX 76210

Dear Mr. Kralicek:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated June 10, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Kralicek Aerial Photography (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment
to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an
amendment to add the DJI S1000.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification
In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
                                                                                                 2

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing

requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11675
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11675 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Tarot 650 and
    DJI S1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Kevin M. Kralicek, am requesting a petition to amend FAA Exemption No. 11675. The amendment will
follow all guidance, guidelines, and rules outlined in FAA Exemption No. 11675. The proposed
amendment is to include a DJI S1000 Octocopter capable of carrying higher quality photographic
equipment. This UAS will be used for the same purposes as outlined in FAA Exemption No. 11675. The
UAS will be under the 55 pound capacity including payload (UAS weight is 24.2 pounds including camera
and batteries) and will not exceed the 87 knot guidance (100mph). The proposed UAS, DJI S1000, is
more sophisticated in flight characteristics and has an additional failsafe that the Tarot 650 does not have.
The additional failsafe is in redundancy, drop protection, and Flight Limit of Special Areas as documented
in Appendix A (4.3.2 or page 71 of this document) and can be checked and verified at
http://www.dji.com/fly-safe/category-mc. If 1-2 of the motors fail, the UAS can still land safely without
crash or incident. Also, if the motors cease a parachute will be deployed. All preflight checks/inspections,
in flight terminations, and post flight checks/inspections will remain the same. Enclosed below are the
manuals for the DJI S1000 and the DJI A2 flight controller. The following will be the additions and
changes to "Appendix A" of the original document:
