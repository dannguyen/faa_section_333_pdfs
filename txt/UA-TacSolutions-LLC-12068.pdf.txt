                                                           Exemption No. 12068
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015-1237

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Antonelli Law
Counsel for UA TacSolutions, LLC
35 East Wacker Drive, Suite 1875
Chicago, IL 60601

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of UA TacSolutions, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct sales
demonstrations and testing.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UASs proposed by the petitioner are the Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8 and
CyberQuad Maxi .

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, UA TacSolutions, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection
. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, UA TacSolutions, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Aerialtronics
    Altura Zenith ATX8 and CyberQuad Maxi when weighing less than 55 pounds
    including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
    petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012
and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Provisions of 14 C.F.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law files this petition for exemption on behalf of UA
TacSolutions, LLC ("TacSolutions"). TacSolutions sells, services and inspects Small Unmanned
Aircraft Systems ("UAs"). It seeks an exemption from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs")
listed in Appendix A to allow commercial operation of its UAs, so long as such operations are
conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA in
a grant of this petition. The commercial operations will be for purposes of conducting
TacSolutions' UA sales and maintenance business, including but not limited to, demonstrating the
capabilities of the UA to potential customers, and test flying customers' UA after TacSolutions
performs servicing or inspection operations on the UA.

         Approval of the exemption for petitioner will allow commercial operation of (1) the
Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8 and (2) the CyberQuad Maxi in Class G airspace nationwide
unless otherwise prescribed by an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued COA. The UAs covered
by this petition are small battery-powered craft, with the Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8
weighing approximately 18.7 lbs. (8.5 kg.) and the CyberQuad Maxi weighing approximately 17.6
lbs. (8 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload. The Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8 has previously
been approved for commercial operations in Exemption Nos. 11175, 11188, and 11237. Operation
of the UA under the strict conditions proposed below will provide an equivalent level of safety, as
Congress intended, while still allowing commercial operations. Operations using these UAs are
far safer than conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that
weigh thousands of pounds, carry highly flammable fuel, and operate in close proximity to the
ground, trees, infrastructure, and people.

         Congress directed the FAA to consider seven factors in deciding whether to approve
Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports,
proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight. In this case, each factor

C.F.R. 409(a)(1) and (2); and 14 C.F.R. 91.417(a) and (b) to operate commercially a
small unmanned aircraft system (UA) (19lbs or less).

Approval of the exemption requested by petitioner will allow commercial operation of
the Aerialtronics Zenith ATX8 and the CyberQuad Maxi in Class G airspace
nationwide. The commercial operations will be for purposes of conducting petitioner's
UA sales and maintenance and training business, including but not limited to,
demonstrating the capabilities of the UAs to potential customers, and test flying
customers' UAs after petitioner performs servicing or inspection operations on the UA.
The requested exemption should be granted because operation of small UAs, with the
Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8 weighing approximately 18.7 lbs. (8.5 kg.) and the
CyberQuad Maxi weighing approximately 17.6 lbs. (8 kg.), inclusive of battery and
payload, conducted in the strict conditions outlined below, will provide an equivalent
level of safety, while still allowing commercial operations. The seven factors Congress
directed the FAA to consider when approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size,
weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated
areas, and operation within visual line of sight ­ each support the request. In particular,
the aircraft are small, and will operate at slow speeds, and close to the ground. The
substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life, coupled with the low
risk use of UAs to conduct these operations, weigh heavily in favor of granting the
exemption.

procedure as the Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8. See Exhibit 2, Section 3.1: Emergency
Procedures Description.

         The specific conditions of the proposed exemption that relate to flight operations are
numbers 11-12, 17-25, and 30-34 in Section V below. Each has been accepted or imposed by the
FAA in numerous previous grants of Section 333 exemption petitions.

IV. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         Petitioner proposes that the exemption apply to UAs that have the characteristics and that
operate with the limitations proposed herein. These limitations provide for a level of safety at least
equivalent to or higher than manned aircraft operations under the current regulatory structure.
Section V below identifies the limitations and conditions to which petitioner agrees to be bound
when conducting commercial operations under a grant of this petition. Appendix A contains a
matrix connecting (i) the specific proposed condition with (ii) the FAR provision for which it
provides an equivalent level of safety and (iii) one or more recent Section 333 exemption grants
in which the FAA recognized this equivalent level of safety.

      Approval of the commercial operations outlined in this petition presents no national security
issue. The PIC will possess, at minimum, a sport pilot's certificate, so he or she will have been
subject to security screenings by the Department of Homeland Security.

V. Proposed Conditions of the Exemption

1. The UAs will weigh no more than (a) 18.7 lbs. (8.5 kg.) (Aerialtronics Altura Zenith ATX8)
    and (b) 17.6 lbs. (8 kg.) (CyberQuad Maxi), inclusive of battery and technical payload.

2. UA operations under this exemption will be limited to conducting operations for the purpose
    of sales demonstrations or testing in Class G airspace nationwide, unless otherwise prescribed
    by an ATO issued COA.

3. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and visual observer.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL, as indicated by the
    procedures specified in the operating documents. All altitudes reported to ATC must be in feet
    AGL.

5. The UA will not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 19.4 knots (Aerialtronics Altura
    Zenith ATX8) and 32.4 knots (CyberQuad Maxi).

6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the UA pilot in command (PIC) and a
    visual observer (VO).

7. The PIC will have, at minimum, a sport pilot license and a third class medical certificate or a
    U.S. driver's license.

8. The petitioner will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC meets its qualification criteria
    and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the UA in a manner consistent with how the UA
    will be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
                                                          9
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR §
    61.51(b). A record of the PIC training will be documented and made available upon request by
    the Administrator. Training operations will only be conducted during dedicated training
    sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential
    for flight operations will be considered nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with
    appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

9. The VO will not perform any other duties beyond assisting the PIC with seeing and avoiding
    other air traffic and other ground based obstacles/obstructions, and will not be permitted to
    operate the camera or other instruments.

10. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not be allowed to transfer his or her
    designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the
    functions prescribed in these conditions and the operating documents.

11. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UA operations prior to each day's
    activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in connection
    with the operations be present for this briefing.

12. Prior to each flight, the PIC will inspect the UA, including the Ground Control Station, to
    ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the
    safe operation of the UA, the PIC will not operate the UA until the necessary maintenance has
    been performed and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All maintenance and
    alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records.

13. Petitioner will conduct a functional flight test on any UA that has undergone maintenance or
    alterations that affect the UA operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight
    critical component. The PIC who conducts the functional test flight will make an entry in the
    aircraft records.

14. The petitioner will carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in
    accordance with the UA manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements set forth in the operating documents.
    Maintenance, inspection, alterations, and status of replacement/overhaul component parts will
    be noted in the aircraft records, including total time in service, description of work
    accomplished, and the signature of the authorized person returning the UA to service. The
    authorized person will make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken against
    discrepancies discovered between inspections.

15. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate verbally. They will not
    be permitted to use electronic messaging or texting to communicate during flight operations.

16. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there
    is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and prepare to
    land with 25% battery power remaining.

                                                         10
17. Actual total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 25% battery
    reserve.

18. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
    emergencies.

19. The UA will be programmed so that if it loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it will
    return to a pre-determined location within the planned operating area and land or be recovered
    in accordance with the operating documents

20. If the UA and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe protection
    will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically, rather than
    flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location.

21. The operating documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be maintained and
    available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UA any time the UA is operating.
    These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption
    grant and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the grant conditions and
    limitations will take precedence and will be followed. Otherwise, the petitioner will follow the
    procedures outlined in its operating documents. If it updates or revises its operating documents,
    it will present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request. If the
    petitioner determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA
    granted the exemption, then the Petitioner will petition for an amendment to the grant of
    exemption.

22. Petitioner will obtain written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents of
    the landowners over which flights will be conducted.

23. Petitioner will obtain all required permissions and permits from territorial, state, county or city
    jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
    agencies.

24. UA operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All operations
    will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights will not be
    conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR).

25. The petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
    Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under the grant of exemption.
    Petitioner will request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but
    not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. All operations will be conducted in accordance
    with airspace requirements in the ATO issued COA, including class of airspace, altitude level
    and potential transponder requirements.

26. The UA will not be operated within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted
    on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management has been obtained, and the operation is conducted in accordance with a NOTAM
    as required by the operator's COA. Any letter of agreement with the airport management will
    be made available to the Administrator upon request.

                                                         11
27. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below, or less than 2,000 feet horizontally from,
    a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

28. All operations shall be conducted in Class G airspace or as otherwise prescribed in an ATO
    issued COA.

29. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings
    in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

30. Before conducting operations, petitioner will ensure that the radio frequency spectrum used
    for operation and control of the UA complies with the Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

31. The UA will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

32. The UA will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

33. Petitioner will conduct all flight operations at least 200 feet from all nonparticipating persons,
    vessels, vehicles, and structures unless one of the following three conditions is met:

    a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the
         UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The petitioner will ensure that
         nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
         nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, the PIC
         will ensure that flight operations cease immediately.

    b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
         such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
         present an undue hazard.

    c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
         undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

34. Petitioner will report any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or
    vertical boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA to the FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Petitioner will report accidents to the National
    Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site:
    www.ntsb.gov.

VI. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur over private property. When a UA is being flown, the onboard cameras will be
focused on the ground beneath it, and thus turned so as to be facing away from any occupied
structures that may be in the area to minimize inadvertent video or still images of uninvolved

                                                         12
persons.

         All data collected will be for private use only and will not be distributed through public
channels. If such data is later made available for public view, all images containing uninvolved
persons will be blurred or blacked-out. No attempt will be made to identify any individuals filmed
during the flights except in cases where they are trespassing upon or damaging customer property,
or interfering with the petitioner's or its customers' operations.

VII. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned UA use will increase ground safety for users of the Aerialtronics Altura Zenith
AT8X and the CyberQuad Maxi by ensuring that the individuals who sell, conduct maintenance
on, and train future users these systems are experienced on the systems, are qualified technicians,
and knowledgeable trainers.

         There are myriad uses for UAs such as the Aerialtronics Altura Zenith AT8X and
CyberQuad Maxi. Both UAs can be used for precision agriculture, asset management, including
wind turbine and power line inspections, law enforcement, and mapping and surveying operations.
However, they are expensive and powerful pieces of equipment. Purchasers will want to work with
experienced and qualified dealers, such as petitioner, when researching and purchasing these
systems. Commercial operators of these UA systems will need a support team, such as the
petitioner's, in order to ensure that their operations continue to be safe. Having experienced and
qualified sales, maintenance, and training programs in the United States is in the public interest.

         Petitioner has devoted significant time and resources to developing risk mitigation
strategies for these UAs. Please refer to the following sections for further information:

         Exhibit 1
                  Section 1: Safety Goals
                  Section 2.4: Incident management and investigation
                  Section 3: Risk Management
                  Section 4: Safety Assurance
                  Section 5: Safety Training
                  Section 6: Safety Promotion

         The enhanced safety and reduced environmental impact achieved using a UA and carrying
no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying
crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UA operation
enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of petitioner's UA, pursuant to
TacSolutions' rules of operation.

GETTING STARTED

Thank you for purchasing the Graupner HoTT 2.4 System Please read through this entire manual before
you attempt the installation and usage of your Graupner HoTT 2.4 System!

These operating instructions are part of this product. They contains important notes to the operation and
handling. Please take this into consideration when you pass on the product to third parties. Neglect of
the operating instructions and the safety instructions lead to expiring the warranty.
Graupner constantly work on the advancement of all remote control systems; changes of the scope of deli-
very in form, technology and equipment we must reserve ourselves therefore. Please have understanding
for the fact that from data and illustrations of this operating instructions no requirements can be derived.
Please keep these instructions for further reference!

1. GENERAL NOTE
When switching on or adjusting the radio control system it is essential to keep the transmitter aerial at
least 15 cm away from the receiver aerials at all times. If the transmitter aerial is too close to the receiver
aerials, the receiver will be overloaded, causing the red LED on the receiver to light up. The transmitter
responds by emitting a beep once every second; the red LED also goes out. The radio control system
is now in Fail-Safe mode.
If this should occur, simply increase the distance between the aerials until the audible warning signal
ceases, and the red LED on the transmitter lights up again; at the same time the red LED on the receiver
should go out.

2. FUNCTIONS

2.1. Binding
When you wish to use the Graupner HoTT 2.4 GHz receiver with a particular transmitter, the first step
must always be to "bind" the unit to "its" Graupner HoTT 2.4 GHz RF module (transmitter). This "binding"
procedure only needs to be carried out once for each combination of receiver and RF module. The units
supplied in the set are already bound to each other at the factory, i.e. the binding procedure described in
the following section only needs to be carried out when you wish to use an additional receiver. However,
it can also be repeated at any time if required, e.g. after changing transmitters. When binding is required,
this is the procedure:
· Switch the transmitter and receiver on.
· Locate the BIND / RANGE button on the back of the transmitter, and hold it pressed in while you

     press and hold the SET button on the receiver. Both LEDs on the back of the transmitter now glow
     constantly, and the red LED on the receiver flashes.
· Under normal circumstances the flashing red LED on the receiver will cease to flash and switch to
     a constant green within about ten seconds. This indicates that the binding process is complete. You
     can now release both buttons, and your transmitter / receiver combination is ready for use.
· However, if the red LED on the receiver continues to flash for longer than ten seconds, then the
     binding process has failed. If this should occur, repeat the whole procedure.

2.1.1.Binding" multiple receivers in one model
If required, it is also possible to bind multiple receivers to the transmitter for a particular model. The first
step is to bind each receiver individually using the procedure already described.
When the system is in use, the receiver which was bound last is the Master receiver. Any telemetry sen-
sors installed in the model must be connected to this unit, as only the Master receiver transmits sensor
data using the downlink channel. The second and all further receivers operate in parallel with the Master
receiver but in Slave mode, with the downlink channel switched off.
The control functions can also be distributed amongst multiple receivers; this is carried out using the
Channel Mapping function of the SMART-BOX (Order No. 33700). In the same way it is possible to as-
sign one control function to multiple receiver outputs; a typical example would be the use of two servos
for each aileron instead of only one, etc.

2.2.Range checking
The method of checking the effective range of the Graupner HoTT 2.4 GHz system is described below.
We recommend that you ask a friend to help you with this procedure.
After binding the receiver to your transmitter, switch the transmitter and the receiver on, and wait until
the green LED on the receiver lights up.
· Install the bound receiver in the model in its final intended position.
· Switch the RC system on, so that you can observe the movement of the servos.
· Set up the model on a flat surface (pavement, closely mown grass or earth), and ensure that the

     receiver aerials are located at least fifteen cm above the ground. This may require a support for the
     model.
· Hold the transmitter at hip-height, away from your body, but do not point the aerial directly at the
     model; instead turn and / or angle the aerial tip so that it stands vertical, and keep it there for the
     duration of the range check.
· Locate the BIND / RANGE button on the back of the transmitter, and press it to initiate range-check
     mode. Hold the button pressed in until the transmitter starts to beep at a regular rhythm; the red and
     green LEDs adjacent to the BIND / RANGE button now flash alternately.
· Walk away from the model, operating the transmitter sticks constantly. If you detect an interruption
     in the link within a range of about fifty metres, stand still and attempt to reproduce it.
· If the model is fitted with a motor, switch it on in order to check whether the power system is gene-
     rating interference.
· Continue to walk away from the model until you reach the point where perfect control is no longer
     possible.
· Now press the BIND / RANGE button on the transmitter once more; this terminates range-check
     mode manually, and the model should respond normally to control commands. If this does not occur
     with 100% reliability, the system should not be used. Contact your local Service Department of
     Graupner GmbH & Co. KG.
· Range-check mode is usually terminated manually when the user presses the BIND / RANGE but
     ton, but it terminates automatically after about ninety seconds in any case. The red LED now glows
     constantly again, while the green LED either glows constantly or flashes continuously, according to
     the Country setting.
· We recommend that you check effective radio range before every flight. While you are carrying
     out the check, simulate all the servo movements which will take place when the model is in flight.
     The ground range must always be at least fifty metres in order to ensure safe, reliable model con-
     trol.

Note:
Range-check mode is usually terminated manually when the user presses the BIND / RANGE button,
but it terminates automatically after about ninety seconds in any case.
CAUTION:
During normal operations (i. e. when controlling a model) never press and hold the programming
button on the transmitter module!

2.3.Fail-Safe function
In its default state (as delivered) the receiver is set to "Hold" mode, i.e. if a fail-safe situation occurs, all
the servos connected to it maintain the last position detected as valid. In this mode the red LED on the
receiver lights up when interference occurs, and the red LED on the transmitter goes out. The transmit-
ter also starts beeping about once per second as an audible warning.
You can exploit the safety potential of the fail-safe option by at least programming the throttle channel to
respond to a fail-safe situation: the throttle channel of an engine-powered model should be set to idle,
the throttle channel of an electric-powered model to "stop", and the throttle channel of a model helicopter
to "Hold". If interference should occur, these settings will help prevent the model flying out of control,
possibly causing personal injury or property damage.
IMPORTANT:
The two functions "Binding" and "Range check" described above can be used regardless of the method
you last employed to program the transmitter, i.e. using the programming button or the SMART-BOX;

neither of these two options causes significant cha1n8ges to the settings saved in the receiver. However,

02 Getting Started Graupner HoTT 2.4
if you call up the Fail-Safe function using the programming button as described below, this resets ALL
the settings of the SMART-BOX at the Fail-Safe screen (RX FAIL SAFE) - and this includes the settings
available through the facilities of the programming button. At the same time the Country setting will
revert to Universal if you have previously selected "France" using the programming button - see below
under "2.4". You MUST therefore select the Country setting again if necessary. For this reason, where-
ver possible it is always best to maintain your programmed settings using the SMART-BOX.

Switch your receiving system on. Locate the BIND / RANGE button on the back of the transmitter, and
hold it pressed in while you switch the transmitter on. Release the button again once it is switched on.
You can now call up the desired Fail-Safe mode (Fail-Safe on / off, Hold, or Standard) by cycling through
the modes with a brief press of the BIND / RANGE button:
· Fail-Safe mode: when you press the BIND / RANGE button, the transmitter beeps once; the red

     and green LEDs glow constantly.
     It is now possible to program positions to which the servos will move in a Fail-Safe situation; this
     occurs after a "Hold" period of 0.75 seconds: move the corresponding transmitter controls (sticks,
     rotary knobs, INC / DEC buttons etc.) to the desired Fail-Safe positions SIMULTANEOUSLY, then
     hold the BIND / RANGE button pressed in for three to four seconds. When you release the button,
     both the red and green LEDs should light up constantly, and the transmitter should not emit an au-
     dible signal: the transmitter now reverts to Control mode. If this does not occur, repeat the procedu-
     re.
· Hold mode (recommended for model helicopters): when you press the BIND / RANGE button,
     the transmitter beeps twice; the red LED lights up constantly, and the green LED goes out (factory
     default setting).
     If interference occurs, all servos programmed to "Hold" remain at the last position detected by the
     receiver as correct; this situation is maintained until such time as the receiver picks up a new, valid
     control signal.
     You can save your selection by holding the BIND / RANGE button pressed in for three to four se-
     conds. When you release the button, both the red and green LEDs should light up constantly, and
     the transmitter should not emit an audible signal: the transmitter now reverts to Control mode. If this
     does not occur, repeat the procedure.
· Fail-Safe OFF: when you press the BIND / RANGE button, the transmitter beeps three times; the
     green LED glows constantly, the red LED goes out.
     You can save your selection by holding the BIND / RANGE button pressed in for three to four se-
     conds. When you release the button, both the red and green LEDs should light up constantly, and
     the transmitter should not emit an audible signal: the transmitter now reverts to Control mode. If this
     does not occur, repeat the procedure.
· Standard mode (suitable for fixed-wing model aircraft only): when you press the BIND / RAN-
     GE button, the transmitter beeps four times; both LEDs are off.
     In this mode the throttle servo (channel 1) moves to the Fail-Safe position, i.e. the position you have
     programmed for a Fail-Safe situation, while all the other channels remain at "Hold".
     Move the throttle stick to the desired position, then hold the BIND / RANGE button pressed in for
     three to four seconds. When you release the button, both the red and green LEDs should light up
     constantly, and the transmitter should not emit an audible signal: the transmitter now reverts to
     Control mode. If this does not occur, repeat the procedure.

2.4.Range warning
If the receiver signal in the down-link channel becomes too weak, the transmitter always generates an
audible range warning in the form of a beep emitted about once per second. Since the transmitter's
output is much higher than that of the receiver, you will still maintain full control of the model, but in the
interests of safety you should fly the model back towards you until the warning signal ceases again.
If the audible range warning signal does not cease when you reduce the distance, then the transmitter
or receiver low voltage or temperature warning is active! In this case you must land the model and cease
operations without delay.

2.5.Firmware update or SMART-BOX connection                                      03

The SMART-BOX is connected to the DATA socke1t 9on the back of the transmitter.

3.1 Connections
Plug the servos into the row of sockets on the right-hand end of the receiver. The connector system is
polarised; note the small chamfer on one edge. Never use force - the plugs should engage easily and
fully. The socket polarity is also marked on the case: brown wire (-), red (+) and orange (signal).
The servo sockets of the Graupner-HoTT 2.4 receiver are numbered. The socket marked "- +/B" is
intended for the battery. If necessary, a servo can be connected to this socket in parallel with the power
supply; a Y-lead (Order No. 3936.11) is required for this.

It is also possible to program the channel 8 for the sum signal using a Graupner HoTT transmitter or the
SMART-BOX (Order No. 33700). This is important for certain optional devices which require this signal.

Power supply for receiver 33508, 33512
When using High Power servos, connect the receiver power supply/s preferably to the vertical ports of
the receiver. If necessary, the servos can be connected to this sockets in parallel with the power supply;
a Y-lead (Order No. 3936.11) is required for this.
The lower sockets (33508 and 33512) should not be used, because an increased voltage drop occurs.
When using a dual power supply, use the sockets on the outside:
Receiver 33506/33508 (GR-12/GR-16): Channel 1 and 6 (or 2 and 5)
Receiver 33512 (GR-24): Channel 11 and 12

3.2.Low voltage warning
If the receiver voltage falls below 3.8 V, the transmitter's RF module generates a low voltage warning in
the form of a "general alarm sound": a steady beeping at intervals of about one second.
Note: The warning threshold can be programmed in the TELEMETRY menu of the transmitter (or with
the SMART-BOX). Please read the manual of your transmitter.

3.3. Temperature warning
If the receiver temperature falls below -10° C or exceeds +70° C, the transmitter's RF module generates
a temperature warning in the form of a "general alarm sound": a steady beeping at intervals of about
one second.
Note: The warning threshold can be programmed in the TELEMETRY menu of the transmitter (or with
the SMART-BOX). Please read the manual of your transmitter.

Press and hold the SET button on the receiver and switch it on, the red and green LED`s are blinking.
After about three seconds the LED`s expires, then only the red LED flashes. Release now the SET
button, the initialization is complete.
Please note:
The initialisation procedure erases ALL the settings you have entered. Where necessary, you will need
to program your preferred settings again.

Any settings you have entered using the SMART-BOX are also lost when you initialise the recei-
ver. If you carry out a receiver firmware update, you will need to re-enter these settings.

Important
If you use the latest Graupner software on your transmitter and receiver, you have to switch off the
FAIL SAFE in the receiver !!!

If you do not switch off the FAIL SAFE the copter can not note the "signal lost" if the connection is broken !!!

Switching off goes like this:
       · Switch ON the transmitter and receiver
       · Push and hold the button ESC - the menu Menü Telemetry opens
       · Down to SETTING & DATA VIEW and open with SET
       · Go right to the menu RX FAIL SAFE
       · OUTPUT CH und INPUT CH are set to 01
       · Down to MODE and edit with SET
       · Change from HOLD to OFF
       · Pres SET again and close the menu with ESC

Ready.

If now the transmitter / receiver lost the signal, the copter will note this.
You can test this quick.Switch off the transmitter. Now the copter should beep.

The described settings and procedures are related to the current V4 from Graupner.

All references to pages of the instruction manual refer to the current manual "33020_mc20_HoTT" (Link).

A working model memory for the MC-20 and a setting for the FlightCtrl you can find and download under
"Example: Setting - Download".

3 Configure the transmitter + bind receiver

3.1 Spring in the transmitter

By default there is a spring at the gas stick which keeps it always in the center position.
Normally this spring of the gas-stick is without function to move the stick infinitely variable. (Instruction of
the transmitter - page 21)

If you have already a little bit experience and if you want to fly with vario-height control all the time, you
don't need to remove the spring.
If you leave the spring in function so that the Gas-Stick is always in a middle-position you need to enter in the
setting (Link) at "Stick neutral point" the middle-position => 127:

3.2 Set Stick Mode

The easiest way (also for beginners) is to fly the MikroKopter in Mode2.
Here you have the function "Gas" and "Yaw" on the left control stick, "Nick" and "Roll" on the right control
stick.
(Instruction of the transmitter - page 84)

If you fly a different mode over years you can also use it here.
The stick arrangement for the different modes (1-4) and how the various functions of the MikroKopter can be
set via the transmitter is described here: Stick-Setup

Adjust transmitter to Stick-Mode2 (or a different mode):
       · In the opening screen of the transmitter you need to press on SET to enter the settings.
       · With the arrow keys UP/DOWN you choose the entry Base setup model and with the key SET you
         open it.
       · Here you switch to the entry Stick mode and choose it with the SET button (The displayed number is
         now a dark background).
       · With the arrow keys you can set now the desired mode (1-4) and save it with "SET".
       · Via the button "ESC" you can switch back.

                                                                5/52

       · Channel 2 = Roll
       · Channel 3 = Nick

       · Channel 4 = Yaw

3.3 Bind the receiver

Transmitter and receiver have to be bound together, so that the receiver only reacts to that transmitter.
(Instruction of the transmitter - page 69)

To bind the receiver you do as follows:

       · When turning on the transmitter you see the message RF ON / OFF. Choose OFF.
       · The receiver has to be supplied with 5V (i.e via 3-core-wire from the FlightCtrl).
       · Press "SET" in the opening screen to get into the settings.
       · Select "Base setup model" with Up / Down and open it with the button SET.
       · In that menu pull down with the arrow key to the entry Base Setup Model.

                 Only if there is already a "BIND", press once SET to get a "n/v".
       · At the receiver now press and hold down the button "SET":

                 Receiver GR-12 => hold down "SET" button.
                 Receiver GR-16 => hold down "SET" button until the red and green LEDs light together

                   (maybe difficult to see that clearly).
                 Receiver GR-24 => hold down "SET" button until the red and green LEDs light together

                   (maybe difficult to see that clearly).
       · Press "SET" within 3 seconds at the transmitter (in the row "RF BIND)
       · "Finding" appears in the display for a short time.
       · "RF BIND [bind]" appears in the display at success and the green LED lights continously at the

         receiver.

3.4 Set the receiver to sum-signal

The !Mikrokopter needs a so-called !sum-signal. All channels of the receiver are included in it. This makes
the wireing a lot easier compared to normal servo-receivers.

After the receiver has been bound to the transmitter you can set the PPM sum-signal:
(Instruction of the transmitter - CH OUTPUT TYPE - page 238)

       · The receiver has to be supplied with 5V (i.e via 3-core-wire from the FlightCtrl).
       · Hold down "ESC" at the transmitter for about 2 seconds -> You get into the menu "Telemetry".
       · Select SETTING & DATA VIEW and open it via the button SET.
       · The menu RX SERVO TEST will open.
       · Switch to the menu "RX SERVO TEST" by pressing "right" 5 times.

                 INFO: If you have clicked to far and you see the MK-Menu you can remove the 1-core
                   telemetry plug from the FC to get back to the page "RX SERVO TEST".

       · In the menu "RX SERVO TEST" you switch to the lower entry CH OUT TYPE.
       · With the button SET you open that entry and you change from "ONCE" to SUMO (with the arrow

         keys UP/DOWN).
       · Confirm with SET.
       · You get to the data field with the number of channels in the sum-signal. Set this to "12" with

         Up/Down (for 12 channels).

                                                               10/52

INFO

If you hold down the button (accidentially) at the receiver while connecting, the "SUMO 12" setting will be
deleted. This can be also happen if you connect the receiver with a powered up Mikrokopter and hold down
the button. In this case you have to set this setting again.

INFO

If you doesn't have a number behind SUMO an older software version is installed in the receiver!

To run the functions on the MikroKopter properly the servo adjustment of the 12 individual channels must
reach a range of "0" to "254" (See also later in the KopterTool).
The servo adjustments at the transmitter are pre-set to 100% for all channels. If you leave it in that way you
are not able to reach the full servo adjustment.
For that reason you need to set all servo adjustments to 103%.

To set the servo adjustments we proceed as follows:

       · Press SET in the opening screen to get into the settings.
       · Select servo adjustment with UP/DOWN and open it with SET.
       · Switch to the channel (S1-S12) which need to be changed. Use the arrow-key to the right on the

         percentages for "- travel +" and select SET.
       · (Both percentage values are selected at the same time (dark background))

                 INFO: If only one percentage value is selected you can toggle/turn through the appropriate
                   switch/potentiometer to the second percentage
                                                               12/52

· Change the percentage value with UP/DOWN to "103%" and press SET to confirm.

In that way you set all 12 channels.

3.6 ASSIGN CHANNELS

In your transmitter the first four channels are already assigned to the control sticks for the function Gas, Yaw,
Nick und Roll.
The remaining channels (5-12) you can assign freely to switches, buttons and potentiometer on your
transmitter.
With those channels you can control the functions of the MikroKopter.
(Instruction of the transmitter - page 71)

Before starting with the assignment of the channels you should establish memory for that at your transmitter.
This memory need to be created as Winged Model. The first memory is usually already set as a Winged Model
and can be used.
Is that not the case or you need an additional model memory (because you operate more than one Kopter or
other models with one transmitter) you can set it as a new Winged Model.

Setting of the channels:

To assign the channels you proceed as follows:

First at all switch all switches to an "OFF"-position (away from you).

       · Press SET in the opening screen to get into the settings.
       · Select Control adjust with UP/DOWN and open it with SET.
       · Choose desired channel with UP/DOWN (i.e. channel 5 => |Input. 5|GL|---| 0%|).
       · Here now switch with LEFT/RIGHT to the three bars (---) and push SET.
       · A display appears "Move desired switch or control adj.".

                                                               14/52

       · Now switch the desired switch (or turn potentiometer).
       · Instead of the three bars you will see now the operated switchn.

Repeat now the operations for the remaining channels.

KopterTool

If the receiver is connected to the FlightCtrl and the transmitter is switched on you can check in the
KopterTool the channel assignment.
By operating the appropriate control on the transmitter you can see the peaks of the signal.

Hints:
       · As a type of the receiver you must set "Graupner HoTT".
       · Therefor the telemetry will be activated and set to the correct channel-offset (Otherwise the zero value
         would be 133 instead of ca. 128 )
       · If you change the type of the receiver you need to save the setting first in the MK (Write) so that
         the changfe will be active.
       · The peaks of the sticks (Nick/Roll/Gas/Yaw) need to have in the middle-position 127 or 128. You can
         adjust it with the trim button (next to the sticks).

11 Example: Setting - Download

11.1 Modell memory for transmitter

   A "ready to use"-setting like above you can download here:
       · Download modell memory (for MC-20)

(To enlarge -> click on the image)
After downloading the file (aMK MC-20.mdl) you can copy it directly into a folder "Models/mc-20" on a
Micro-SD-Card.
How you import model memories from the Micro-SD-Card into your transmitter can be read in the instruction
on page 66 (Chapter: Import SD).
>
INFO:
If you insert an empty Micro-SD-Card into the transmitter and switch it on, automatically the needed

                                                               50/52

directories will be created.

In this model memory is the upper right Flight-Time counter/Flt active. This one is set in that way as soon as
the Gas-Stick will be moved upwards the Flight-Time counter starts.
This Flight-Time counter is required so that the GPS position data of the Kopter can be saved on a
Micro-SD-Card in your transmitter.
So, if the Kopter is maybe getting lost you still have then the last received coordinates of the Kopter.

Is the Gas-Stick down this counter still continues! (Instruction see page 139)
To stop it you can push the ESC button.
To reset the Flight-Time counter you need to push the UP/DOWN (or LEFT/RIGHT) button to the same time
on the right Touch-Pads.
(Instructions of the transmitter - page 138 + 252)

   The channels in both model memory are set as you can see here.
If you use this model memory you have to set this functions/channels in the settings of the FlightCtrl.
(or you dowload the setting below and update your FlightCtrl with this setting.)

(to enlarge -> click image)

TIPP: If you use a different mode rather then Mode 2 you are still able to use the downloaded model
memory.
After downloading the model memory you can set the desired mode (1,3,4) by yourself (Instruction manual
page 68).

                                                               51/52

The control sticks have then the channels/function of the set mode. All other switches/channels remain as
described in the example.

11.2 Setting FlightCtrl

Here you find a setting for the FlightCtrl (from V2.02): Download.
The settings are adjusted with the model memory for the MC-20.
