                                                          Exemption No. 11398
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0145

Mr. Marco F. Zvanik
Ventus Wind, LLC
7202 Greystone Lane
Frisco, TX 75034

Dear Mr. Zvanik:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 20, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Ventus Wind, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial inspections of its legacy power generation customers and to expand to support
the growth of new customers in the onshore and offshore regions of the United States.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI
Inspire 1, and DJI Spreading Wings S-1000.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Ventus Wind LLC. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
                                                                                            3

the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data. This
exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Ventus Wind, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
         DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI S-1000 when weighing less than
         55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a
         new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
                                                                                                            4

    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

                                           BASIS FOR PETITION

         Petitioner, Ventus Wind, LLC., pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 C.F.R. § 11.61) and the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Section
333, Special Rules for Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems, hereby petitions the Administrator
for an exemption from the requirements of 14 C.F.R. §§ 45.23(b), 61.113(a) and (b), 91.7(a),
91.9(b) (2), 91.103, 91.109, 91.119, 91.121, 91.151(a), 91.203(a) and (b), 91.405(a), 1.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(2), and 91.417(a) and (b)., as well as the restricted category airworthiness certification
standards specified in 14 C.F.R. § 21.185, including the requirement to have a certificate of
airworthiness as contemplated by 14 C.F.R. Part 21.

In accordance with 14 C.F.R. § 11.81, Ventus provides the following information in support of

         The Specific Sections of 14 C.F.R. From Which Ventus Seeks Exemption.

    1. 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 C.F.R. §91.203 (a) (1)

    Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for
the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1). Given the size and
limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by Ventus, an exemption from
Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and
Section 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.§44701 (f)) and Section 333
of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an
airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability,
and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UAV. In all cases, an analysis of
these criteria demonstrates that the UAV operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the
restricted environment and under the conditions proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a
conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness certificate
without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

    All of the UAV's to be operated hereunder are less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, carry neither a
pilot nor passenger, carry no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operate
exclusively within a secured area as set out in the Ventus Operations Manual. Unlike other civil
aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by both the
operator, pursuant to the Manual's requirements, and under the requirements and in compliance
with local public safety requirements, to provide security for the area of operation as is now done
with conventional inspections. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations. These safety
enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in connection with power
generation inspections, provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property owners then
conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.F.R.
Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no
credible threat to national security posed by the UAV's, due to their size, speed of operation,
location of operation, lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry
a substantial external load.

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 11
    2. 14 C.F.R. § 45.23 (b). Marking of the Aircraft
         The regulation requires: When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the

registration number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or
experimental or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft
near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more
than 6 inches high, the words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or
"provisional," as applicable.

         Even though the UAV will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be
needed as the UAV will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the
words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," can be placed.
Given the size of the UAV, two-inch lettering will be impossible. The word "experimental,"
may be placed on one of the rotor arms of each UAV, in compliance with §45.29 (f). The
equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the UAVs marked on their rotor arm as
required by §45.29 (f) where the pilot, observer and others working with the UAV will see the
identification of the UAV as "experimental,".

         The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation to Exemptions Nos.
10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

    3. 14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in
         Command.
         Sections 61.113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the

UAVs will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent
level of safety of current operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have a private
pilot's license rather than a commercial pilot's license to operate these small UAVs. Unlike a
conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, Ventus' UAVs are remotely controlled
with no living thing on board. The area of operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights
are planned and coordinated in advance as set forth in the Ventus Operations Manual VSI-005
Rev. 2 (Manual). The level of safety provided by the requirements included in the Manual
exceeds that provided by a single individual holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a
conventional aircraft. The risks associated with the operation of the UAVs are so diminished
from the level of risk associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 12
drafted, that allowing operations of these UAVs as requested with a private pilot as the PIC
exceeds the present level of safety achieved by 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) & (b).

    4. 14 C.F.R. §91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.
         The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy

condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness.
Given the size of the aircraft and the requirements contained in the Manual for maintenance and
use of safety check lists prior to each flight, as set forth in Sections J, L and Q, an equivalent
level of safety will be provided.

    5. 14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.
         Section 91.9 (b) (2) provides:

                  No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft ...

                  (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
                  this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved airplane or
                  Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
                  any combination thereof.

The UAVs, given their size and configuration have no ability or place to carry such a flight
manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no room
or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.

         The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the
ground control point where the pilot flying the UAV will have immediate access to it. The FAA
has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299,
9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and 10700.

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 13
    6. 14 C.F.R. § 91.103: Preflight action
         This regulation requires each pilot in command to take certain actions before flight to

insure the safety of flight. As FAA approved rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided for
the aircraft an exemption will be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be provided as set
forth in the Manual. The PIC will take all actions including reviewing weather, flight battery
requirements, landing and takeoff distances and aircraft performance data before initiation of
flight.

    7. 14 C.F.R. §91.109: Flight instruction:
         Section 91.103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free

balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual
controls.

         UAVs and remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual
controls. Flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with
the aircraft via radio communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training
without fully functional dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in
experimental aircraft. See Exemption Nos.5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of safety
provided by the fact that neither a pilot nor passengers will be carried in the aircraft and by the
size and speed of the aircraft.

    8. 14 C.F.R. §91.119: Minimum safe altitudes
         Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119(d)

allows helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person
operating the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the
FAA. As this exemption is for a UAV that is a multi-rotor VTOL and the exemption requests
authority to operate at altitudes up to 400 ft. AGL, or not more than 200 ft. above an elevated
platform from which operations are planned, an exemption may be needed to allow such
operations. As set forth herein, except for the limited conditions stated in the Manual, the UAV
will never operate at higher than 400 ft. AGL. It will however be operated in a restricted area
with security perimeter, where buildings and people will not be exposed to operations without
their pre-obtained consent.

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 14
         The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the UAVs
as well as the location where they will be operated. No flight will be taken without the
permission of the property owner or local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property
owner and participants in the filming activity, all affected individuals will be aware of the
planned flight operations as set forth in the Manual. Compared to flight operations with aircraft
or rotorcraft weighting far more than the maximum 55 lbs. proposed herein and the lack of
flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less than those presently
presented with conventional aircraft operating at or below 400 ft. AGL in the power generation
industry. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the UAVs will ensure separation between
these small UAV operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with
Section 91.119.

    9. 14 C.F.R. §91.121 Altimeter Settings
         This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by

reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the UAV may not have a barometric altimeter,
but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety
will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the Manual and Safety Check list, confirming the
altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

    10. 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions
         Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under

VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel
to fly to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ (1) During the
day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45
minutes."

         The batteries powering all of Ventus' UAV's provide approximately 35 minutes of
powered flight. To meet the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR §91.151, UAV flights
would be limited to approximately five (5) minutes in length. Given that this limitation would
prohibit the flight of the UAV's a longer time frame for flight in daylight or night VFR
conditions is reasonable.

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 15
         Ventus believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) falls within the scope of
prior exemptions. See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate
without compliance with FAR 91.151 (a)). Operating the small UAV, in a tightly controlled area
where only people and property owners or official representatives who have signed waivers will
be allowed, with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel, does not engender the type of risks that
Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed of the small UAV.

         Additionally, limiting UAV flights to 5 minutes would greatly reduce the utility for
which the exemption will be granted.

         Ventus believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to
25% of battery power. This restriction would be more than adequate to return the UAV's to their
planned landing zone from anywhere in their limited operating area.

         Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689F,
5745, 10673, and 10808.

11. 14 C.F.R. §91.203 (a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration
    The regulation provides in pertinent part:

(a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft
unless it has within it the following:

         (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate. . . .
(b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate
required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued
under §91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to
passengers or crew.

         All of Ventus' UAV's fully loaded weigh no more than 55 lbs and are operated without
an onboard pilot. As such, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration
documents or to display them on the UAV's.

         An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the UAV will have immediate access to them, to the extent
they are applicable to the UAV. The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 16
representative sample of other exceptions includes Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A,
9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

    12. 14 C.F.R. §91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections
         These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft

inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of
this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

         Given that these sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to Ventus. Maintenance will be accomplished by Ventus
pursuant to the flight manual and operating handbook as referenced in the Manual.(See Sections
L and Q) An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because these small UAVs are very
limited in size and will carry a small payload and operate only in restricted areas for limited
periods of time. If mechanical issues arise the UAV can land immediately and will be operating
from no higher than 400 feet AGL. As provided in the Manual, Ventus will ensure that every
UAV is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform required maintenance, and keep a log
of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the operator is the person most familiar with the
aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the
equivalent level of safety.

    13. The Extent Of Relief Ventus Seeks And The Reason Ventus Seeks Relief From 14
         C.F.R. § 21.185.
         Ventus seeks relief from the airworthiness certificate requirements of the Federal

Aviation Regulations and proposes to commercially operate the DJI PHANTOM II and Inspire 1
UAV, without an airworthiness certificate, for the special purpose of conducting aerial inspection
services for its customers, pursuant to specific operating limitations and a Safety Management
System ("SMS"). Ventus seeks relief from the airworthiness certificate requirements of 14
C.F.R. § 21.185 to the extent that the DJI PHANTOM II and Inspire 1 UAV, which have not yet
been type certificated by the FAA, may be operated as if they were a restricted category aircraft
for a single, defined, special purpose operation (i.e., aerial inspection).

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 17
         Pursuant to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Section 333 ("Section
333"), Ventus seeks relief from the airworthiness certificate requirements of the FAR because
operation of the DJI PHANTOM II and Inspire 1 UAV will not create a hazard to users of the
NAS, or the public, or otherwise pose a threat to national security. Section 333 sets forth the
requirements for considering whether a UAV will create a hazard to users of the NAS or the
public or pose a threat to national security. Further, Section 333 provides the authority for such
UAV to operate without airworthiness certification.
Specifically, Section 333 states the following, in part:

         (b) Assessment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems.--In making the determination under
         subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine, at a minimum--

         (1) which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size, weight,
         speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation
         within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system
         or the public or pose a threat to national security; and

         (2) whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness
         certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the
         operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1set forth below,
         numerous factors, including the proven safe operational history of the DJI PHANTOM II,
         S1000 and Inspire 1 UAV in the NAS, as well as the specific parameters of Ventus'
         intended operation pursuant to this exemption, demonstrate that the DJI PHANTOM II,
         S1000 and Inspire 1 UAV have in the past, and will continue in the future, to operate
         safely in the NAS without creating a hazard to other aircraft or people on the ground.
         Accordingly, the FAA may approve operation of the DJI PHANTOM II, S1000 and
         Inspire 1 UAV, without an airworthiness certificate, by setting forth specific operating
         limitations to ensure a level of safety equivalent to what would be provided by
         airworthiness certification.

14 C.F.R. §21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R 45.23(b); §§ 61.113(a) & (b); 91.7(a); 91.9 (b) (2);
91.103 (b);91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151 (a); 91.203(a) and (b); 91.405(a); 91.407 (a)
(1); 91.409 (a) (2); 91.409 (a) (2), 91.417 (a) & (b), as well as the restricted category
airworthiness certification standards specified in 14 C.F.R. § 21.185 to operate
commercially unmanned vehicle (55lbs or less) for aerial inspections.

         Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of UAVs in the power
generation inspection industry will enhance safety by reducing risk. Conventional power
generation inspections, using persons dangling from ropes at altitudes of 300 to 450 feet are
potential cause for falls, death or injury. In contrast, a Ventus UAV weighing fewer than 55 lbs.
and powered by batteries eliminates virtually all human risk to serious falls given that the PIC is
on the ground.

         Every Ventus UAV is carried to the inspection site and not flown. The UAV's will carry
no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks associated with manned
aircraft flights. The operation of small UAVs, weighting less than 55 lbs., conducted in the strict
conditions outlined above, will provide an improved level of safety supporting the grant of the
exemptions requested herein, including exempting the Ventus from the requirements of Part 21
and allowing commercial operations. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to
the ground, and in a sterile environment and, as a result, are far safer than conventional
operations conducted by humans dangling from ropes.

Reasons Why Granting Ventus's Request Would Be In The Public Interest
         Granting the present Petition will further the public interest by allowing Ventus to safely,

efficiently, and economically perform aerial inspection services of power generation facilities,
onshore oil and gas platforms, pipelines and land developers Additionally, use of the Ventus

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 19
UAV's will increase worker safety by reducing human exposure to rope access work at extreme
heights, increase the frequency of power generation inspections being performed thereby
increase power plant safety and provide significant benefits to the reduction in costs associated
with the maintenance of power generation facilities. Notably, the benefits of the proposed
operation of the Ventus UAV will be realized without implicating any privacy issues.

Privacy:
         All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's

prior consent and knowledge. Aerial inspections will be of power generation equipment,
production facilities or buildings in remote or uninhabited areas.

         Set forth below are pictures of aerial inspections conducted in the day environment, as
performed today using humans on ropes. The grant of this exemption request will provide
improved safety in day operations.

Flight Operations:
         Flight Operations pursuant to the exemption sought would be limited to areas that are not

in the proximity of airports or over populated areas. Ventus proposes to only conduct aerial
inspection flight operations over private land, in rural areas of the United States that are not near
populated areas, airports, helipads, or state roads.

         Specifically, Ventus' proposed areas of aerial inspections include rural areas that are:
         1. Not populated areas as depicted on VFR Sectional Aeronautical Charts;
         2. Not within five (5) miles of any airport or helipad;
         3. Not within one hundred (100) meters of state roads having more than two lanes; and
         4. Not within fifty (50) meters of state roads having two lanes or less.

Ventus has been operating all of its UAV's by regulations such as the ICAO (International Civil
Aviation Organization) and the FAA's own national airspace regulations. In order to increase
flight safety and prevent accidental flights in restricted areas, all of Ventus' UAV's will be
operated utilizing Category "A" No Fly Zone restrictions.

Figure 4: Example of Category "A" No Fly Zone for Ventus

VENTUS SECTION 333 PETITION 7202 Greystone, Frisco, Texas 75034  Page 22
A buffer or exclusion zone for flight operations will also be implemented around state
roads. Since the roads are represented geometrically as lines, the buffers result as a one hundred
(100m) corridor around state roads with more than two lanes, and fifty (50) meters around state
roads with two lanes or less. In summary, Ventus seeks to operate its UAV's only over rural
areas, while maintaining safe distances from any populated areas, airports, helipads, or
roadways.

Operation Of Ventus' UAV's Will Be Conducted Pursuant To "VSI-005 UAS Operations
Manual (For UAS's under 55 lbs)."

         Ventus' Operations Manual VSI-005 will control operation UAV's and will significantly
contribute to maintaining the level of safety contemplated by the airworthiness certificate
requirements from which Ventus now seeks relief. Pursuant to the Operations Manual and 14
C.F.R. § 43.13, entitled Performance Rules (general), each person performing maintenance,
alteration, or preventive maintenance on any of Ventus' UAV's, motors, propellers, hardware,
guidance systems or appliances shall use the methods, techniques, and practices prescribed in the
current manufacturer's maintenance manual or Instructions for Continued Airworthiness
prepared by its manufacturer, or other methods, techniques, and practices acceptable to the
Administrator. Each person shall use the tools, equipment, and test apparatus necessary to assure
completion of the work in accordance with accepted industry practices.

         A copy of the Operations Manual, which is proprietary information to Ventus, is attached
hereto as Exhibit B, and is to be held in a separate file pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 11.35(b).3

Flight Operations Of Ventus' UAV's Are Limited To Line Of Sight Of The PIC WithA
Safety Observer.

         Ventus will only utilize PIC's with a valid Recreational or Private Pilot rating certificate
issued by the FAA for operation of all UAV's and a Class II Medical Certificate. Additionally,
all pilots will be assisted by a safety observer. The pilot in command and safety observer must
meet the requirements as set forth by the Operations Manual adopted by Ventus for flight
operations of the UAV's.

CONLUSION:

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012--size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemptions allowing commercial operation of applicant's UAS in the
power generation industry pursuant to the Manual appended hereto.
