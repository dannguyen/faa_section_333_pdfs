                                                           Exemption No. 12027
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1381

Mr. Timothy A. Paris
Vice President of Operations
Mr. William M. Bogar, Esq.
Attorney/Superintendent
Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc.

Atlasburg, PA 15004-0369

Dear Messrs. Paris and Bogar:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial imaging for monitoring of construction sites.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a Yuneec Q500 Typhoon.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Yuneec Q500
    Typhoon when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
    of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
                                                                                                            4

    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

Re: Request for Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Refonn Act of2012 and
Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations from Certain Sections of 14 C.P.R.

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012 (the "Reform Act"), Alex E.
Paris Contracting Company, a Pennsylvania Corporation (Petitioner) and planned operator of a Small
Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation
Regulations (FAR's) to allow for commercial operation of its sUAS to provide aerial imaging for
monitoring of secured and controlled construction sites, so long as these operations are conducted under
the conditions outlined within this framework or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section
333. A summary of this request suitable for publication in the Federal Register is provided within Part
VIII of this application.

The requested exemption would allow the Petitioner to safely, efficiently and economically use a
commercial sUAS within the National Air System (NAS). As detailed in this document and the attached
instruction manual (plus additional documentation) within the Appendix, the requested exemption would
permit the Petitioner to operate the sUAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is limited and
predetermined. In addition, access to the sites, themselves, will be tightly controlled. Accordingly, the
approval ofthis exemption would enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's
responsibilities under Section 333(c) of the Reform Act to "establish requirements for the safe operation
of such aircraft systems in the National Airspace System (NAS)."

  construction and a variety of industrial services related to it. Operating primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio
  and the Mid-Atlantic region, we engage in a variety of construction services, both public and private,
  which include underground utility installation, site development, building foundation construction, site

  Having been in existence for 67 years, we are members in, and actively involved in the National Utility
  Contractor's Association, Pennsylvania Utility Contractor's Association, West Virginia Utility
  Contractor's Association, American General Contractors Association and the Associated Builders and
  Contractors Association.

II. RELEVANT STATUTORY AUTHORITY

    This petition for exemption is submitted in accordance with Section 333(a) through (c) ofthe FAA
    Modernization and Refonn Act of2012. The "Reform Act" gives authority to the Secretary of
    Transportation to consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) may operate safely
    within the National Airspace System (NAS) before completion of the rulemaking required under
    Section 332 of the "Reform Act". The Secretary has delegated this aviation authority to the
    Administrator of the FAA. In making this determination, the Administrator must determine which
    types of UAS's do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national
    security in light of the following considerations, stated under Section 333(b):

          · The size, weight, speed and operational capability of the UAS.

          · Whether the UAS operates within the visual sight line ofthe operator.

          · Whether the UAS operates within close proximity to airports and populated areas.

                                                                          2
    Accordingly, under Section 333(c), if the Administrator makes the determination that the UAS "may
    operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS), the Secretary shall establish requirements for the
    safe operation of such aircraft in the national airspace system (NAS).

    In addition, under 49 U.S.C. § 44701(£) the Administrator is expressly given the authority to grant
    exemptions from its safety regulations and standards if the Administrator finds the exemption is in the
   public interest. (49 U.S.C. § 44701(£) permits exemptions from§§ 44701(a) & (b) and§§ 44702
    through 44716). Furthermore, a party requesting such an exemption must explain the reasons why the
    exemption: (1). would be in the public interest or how it would benefit the public as a whole, and (2).
    that it would not adversely affect safety (or how it would provide a level of safety at least equal to the
    existing regulation from which exemption is sought) under 14 C.P.R.§ 11.81.

    The sUAS owned by Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. is a small multirotor vehicle and it
    weighs less than 5 pounds (apx. 60oz.) at lift-off. Under normal conditions, it operates at a speed of no
    more than 25 knots. It has the capability of hovering and moving within both a horizontal and vertical
    plane simultaneously. The sUAS will operate only in the visual line of sight of its pilot in command
    (PIC) and a visual observer (VO) that will be present during actual flight operations. The sUAS will
    only operate under controlled conditions, in airspace that is both predetermined and limited. In
    addition, ground-access to these sites will be tightly controlled. Finally, the sUAS will operate at an
    altitude of no more than 400 feet, posing no risk to users of the national airspace system. Accordingly,
   these operations insure that the sUAS will "not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system
    or to the public" as mandated within Section 333(b) of the Reform Act.

    Given the small size of the sUAS involved and the restricted environment within which it will operate,
   this petition for exemption falls squarely within the "equivalent level of safety" under 14 C.F.R §
    11.81 in which Congress intended that the FAA, by exemption, permit commercial operation of the
    sUAS to commence, pending completion of formal rulemaking. Furthermore, due to its small size plus
   the low altitudes and restricted areas in which it will operate, approval of this petition presents no
   national security issue.

    Considering the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the
   Federal Aviation Act as amended, the equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations
    and the public benefit which it will incur, the grant of the requested exemptions are also in the public
    interest.

   Accordingly, Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. respectfully requests the FAA to grant the
    requested exemption without delay.

III. PUBLIC INTEREST

   This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section
    333(a) through (c) of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012 (the "Reform Act"). The law
    allows the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether certain small unmanned aircraft systems
    (sUAS) can operate safely within the national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the
    rulemaking that is required under Section 332 of the "Reform Act". By granting an exemption, the
    FAA will fulfill Congress' intent of allowing a sUAS to operate with significant safety precautions in
    a restricted, low risk environment.

    The use of a sUAS on a construction site will significantly reduce the risk to our employees/workers
    with respect to slips and falls while inspecting, surveying and monitoring site progress. A sUAS is

                                                                     3
    capable of photographing and collecting data from many areas that normally require employee
    inspection, thus eliminating many of the risks associated with it. Accordingly, since slips and falls are
    a major source of construction site injuries and fatalities, the effect of reducing their probability
    through the use of a sUAS would squarely be within the public interest.

    In addition, the use of a sUAS on a construction site will allow for a more thorough site review,
    potentially revealing issues and concerns that might not be evident from an on-ground, visual
    inspection. Generally, the projects that we undertake are subject to stringent environmental controls.
    The primary objective of these controls is to regulate (or even eliminate) the discharge of potential
    pollutants from the site into the surrounding environment. Often the failure of these controls to do so
    may subject the contractor to substantial fines from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a
    similar state authority or both. As a contractor, we take both the construction and maintenance of
    environmental controls very seriously, conducting visual inspections on a daily basis. In addition to
    the risks posed by slips and falls, visual inspections can only provide a limited, view of the
    effectiveness of these controls. The use of a sUAS will provide a birds-eye, view of the controls. Any
    potential breaches will readily be evident as will be the extent of the discharge and potential damage
    done to the surrounding environment. The collection of such data will allow for faster, more focused
    and efficient repair and maintenance times. This too, is squarely within the public interest since a more
    sustainable and cleaner eco-system is beneficial to everyone.

    The sUAS can provide for quick and cost effective aerial monitoring of all or a significant portion of a
    construction site-something that is not possible without this technology. The sUAS can be used to
    monitor site progress on a daily basis, allowing site crews and project managers to examine and
    inspect completed work for flaws, more quickly. Similarly, aerial monitoring will allow for a more
    efficient allocation of equipment and manpower-as it will allow site crews and project managers to
    better identify areas of the project that require additional resources. These considerations are within
    the public interest because they enhance the ability to produce a safer product and work to assure both
    the cost-effectiveness and safety of the work performed.

    The sUAS that we propose to fly for operations under this application weighs less than 5 pounds (apx.
    60oz) and carries no on-board pilot, passengers or cargo. It also carries no combustible fuels or other
    flammable material-unlike larger conventional aircraft that could be used to provide the same services.
    Utilizing a sUAS, instead of a larger conventional aircraft, provides for a much greater degree of
    safety for both our employees and the general public. Lastly, it should also be noted that our sUAS
    will be powered by rechargeable lithium ion batteries-as opposed to the burning of fossil fuels. Hence,
    the environmental impact of utilizing the sUAS for aerial imaging is greatly reduced-especially when
    contrasted with the use of a larger conventional aircraft to provide the same thing.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS

    The grant of exemption to Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. for the Yuneec QSOO Typhoon
    sUAS will be subject to the following operating conditions. The main restrictions have been
    summarized below.

    1. Operations will be conducted over private, controlled-access, or public property where approved.

    2. Written and/or verbal permission from the land-owner/authority will be required before the
    commencement of any flight.

                                                                      4
3. All operations conducted within 5 miles from an airport shall only be initiated after verbal
coordination with the airport authority, or air traffic control when a control tower is present at the
airport.

4. All onsite personnel will consent to the sUAS flyover on site by written waiver and the pilot in
command (PIC) will obtain additional written or verbal consent of anyone who is allowed within 100
feet of the flight operation.

5. All required permissions and pennits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or city
jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental agencies.

6. A briefing will be conducted with regard to the planned sUAS operation prior to the start of each
day's operations. This briefing will be mandatory for all personnel who are performing duties within
the boundaries of the secured area of which the sUAS will be operating.

7. The Yuneec Typhoon Q500 (sUAS) weighs less than 5 pounds (apx. 60oz.).

8. All flights will be operated within the visual line of sight of both the pilot in command (PIC) and an
additional visual observer (VO).

9. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be limited to the amount of time that the
second low battery warning indicator on the hand-held flight control box is achieved. This generally
allows for a flight time of20-25 minutes, as per manufacturer's specifications.

10. All flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level (AGL) and
will operate in the secured area within a confined geo-fence, defined by a maximum 300 foot radius.

11. The minimum crew for each operation will consist of a pilot in command (PIC) and a visual
observer (VO).

12. The pilot in command (PIC) will be an FAA licensed airman with a private pilot's certificate (or a
sUAS certificate, once the FAA establishes the criteria and procedures for obtaining a sUAS license)
and a second class medical certificate.

13. The sUAS will operate in accordance with all safety and operational requirements contained within
the instruction manual attached in the Appendix to this application.

14. Both the pilot in command (PIC) and visual observer (VO) will be trained in operation of the
Yuneec Q500 Typhoon and will have received up-to-date maintenance information regarding the
sUAS.

15. The pilot in command (PIC) will conduct a pre-flight inspection, prior to each flight and determine
that the sUAS is in a condition safe for flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe
operation ofthe sUAS, the aircraft will be prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance
is performed and the sUAS is made safe for flight. All maintenance performed on the sUAS will be
denoted in a Maintenance Log kept specifically for the sUAS.

16. The pilot in command (PIC) and visual observer (VO) will be able to communicate by voice at all
times.

17. The pilot in command (PIC) will be trained in advance for the safe operation of the sUAS to be

                                                                  5
    operated. This will include operation of the sUAS both in normal and in emergency modes of
    operation, and will include familiarization with the instruction manual published by the sUAS
    manufacturer and attached in the Appendix to this application. Training will also include types of
    maneuvers to be performed and the safe operation in relation to persons, property and applicable
    airspace.

    18. Contingency plans will be in place to safely tenninate flight if there is a loss of communication
    between the pilot in command (PIC) and visual observer (VO).

    19. Operations will only be conducted during daylight hours.

V. REGULATIONS FROM WHICH EXEMPTION IS REQUESTED

    Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. ("Petitioner") requests an exemption from the following
    regulations as well as any additional regulations that may technically apply to the operation of
    sUAS's:

    14 C.F.R. Part 21(h): Airworthiness Certificates.
   14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a) (1)

    14 C.P.R.§ 91.203(a) (1) requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within it a
    certificate of airworthiness. 14 C.P.R. Part 21(h) establishes the procedural requirements for the
    issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by 14 C.P.R.§ 91.203(a) (1). The Federal Aviation
    Act and Section 333 gives the FAA authorization to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an
    airworthiness certificate upon consideration of certain characteristics. These characteristics include the
    size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and populated areas of the
    particular UAS. Given the size of the aircraft, that we intend to operate (less than 5 lbs.) and the
    limited operating area associated with these operations, an exemption from 14 C.P.R. Part 21(h) meets
    the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the Reform Act.

    Equivalent Level of Safety

    In this case, a further examination of these criteria demonstrate that the sUAS operated without an
    airworthiness certificate, under the conditions proposed herein, will be at least as safe, or safer, than a
    conventional aircraft (either fixed wing or rotorcraft) with an airworthiness certificate. The sUAS
    operated by Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. has a gross take-offweight of less than 5 pounds
    (apx. 60 oz.). It will not carry a pilot or a passenger. It will not carry explosive materials or flammable
    liquid fuels. It will operate exclusively in a secured area with receipt of permission from the landowner
    and consent obtained from all ground personnel, prior to flight. Unlike other civil aircraft, all proposed
    operations of the sUAS will be tightly controlled and monitored by its pilot in command (PIC) and an
    additional visual observer (VO). Furthennore, the aircraft will be carried to the area of operation, not
    flown.

    Taken together, these safety enhancements provide a greater degree of safety to the Petitioner's
    employees, members of the public and property owners than conventional operations of civil aircraft
    that require an airworthiness certificate under 14 C.P.R. Part 21(h). Such aircraft are considerably
    larger, carry passengers and cargo as well as flammable fuel and operate without the restrictions and
    conditions being proposed for our sUAS. In addition, application of these same criteria clearly
    demonstrate that the proposed operation of our sUAS poses no credible threat to national security due
    to its size, speed of operation, lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels and inability to

                                                                     6
    carry a substantial external load. The FAA has issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. Part 2l(h) a
    sampling includes the following exemptions: 11062, 11080, Ill 09, 11153, and 11174. The FAA has
    issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a) (1), a sampling includes the following exemptions:
    11062, 11080, 11109, 11153, and 11174.

14 C.F.R. § 45.23: Marking of the Aircraft.
14 C.F.R. § 91.9(c)
14 C.F.R. § 45.27(a)

Applicant seeks an exemption from the aircraft marking and identification requirements contained in 14
C.F.R. § 45.23, 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(c) and 14 C.F.R. § 45.27(a).

· 14 C.F.R. § 45.23, Markings of the Aircraft, states:

       (a). Each operator of an aircraft must display on that aircraft marks consisting of the Roman capital
            letter "N'? (denoting United States registration) followed by the registration number of the
            Aircraft. Each suffix letter used in the marks displayed must also be a Roman capital letter.

       (b). When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the registration number is displayed
            on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated
            aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near the entrance to the cabin, cockpit or
            pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words "limited"
            "restricted", "light-sport", "experimental", or "provisional", as applicable.

· 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(c), Civil Aircraft Flight Manual, Marking & Placard requirements, provides that:

          No person may operate a US-registered civil aircraft unless that aircraft is identified in
          Accordance with Part 45 of this chapter.

· 14 C.F.R. § 45.27(a), Rotorcraft, states:

          Each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that rotorcraft horizontally on both surfaces of the
          Cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail the marks required by§ 45.23(b).

Exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 45.23(b) is warranted because the sUAS has no entrance to the cabin,
cockpit or pilot station on which the markings can be placed. Given the size of the sUAS, 2 inch lettering
will be impossible, as well.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Official marking systems for sUAS have yet to be established for operations inside the NAS. Petitioner is
prepared to mark the sUAS with its name, location and origin. Petitioner will also fulfill any other request
made by the FAA on this topic in accordance with 14 C.F.R. § 45 .29(f) where the pilot, observer and any
others working with the sUAS will see the identification of the sUAS.

The FAA has issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 45.23(b), a sampling includes the following
exemptions: 8738, 10167, 10167A and 101700.

The FAA has issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(c), a sampling includes the following
exemptions: 11136, 11170,11171, 11174, and 11185.

                                                                    7
14 C.F.R. § 61.113(a) & (b): Pilot in Command (P.I.C.)

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the private pilot privileges and limitations, outlined in 14 C.F.R. §
61.113(a) & (b). Accordingly, these regulations state:

· (a). Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) ofthis section, no person who holds a
          private pilot certificate may act as a pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers
          or property for compensation or hire: nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot
          in command of an aircraft.

          (b). A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft in
          connection with any business or employment if:

          (1). The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and

          (2). The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire.

Accordingly, under paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, no person who holds a private pilot
certificate may act as pilot in command (PIC) of an aircraft which is carrying passengers or property for
compensation or for hire; Similarly, nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in
command (PIC) of an aircraft. However, a private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in
command (PIC) of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment in certain circumstances-
specifically, if that flight is only incidental to that business or employment and the aircraft does not carry
passengers or property for compensation or for hire.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Because the sUAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operation can achieve the equivalent
level of safety contemplated under these regulations by requiring the pilot in command (PIC) operating
the aircraft to have a private pilot's license rather than a commercial pilot's license. Firstly, any flight
conducted with the sUAS will only be incidental to that business or employment. Secondly, unlike a
conventional aircraft carrying a pilot and living passengers, the sUAS is remotely controlled with no
living thing or any cargo onboard. Additionally, the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon is equipped with numerous
safety features that greatly reduce the risk of human error, contemplated by this regulation.

· At start-up and prior to flight, the sUAS undergoes a self-initialization process. Flight is not
           possible unless this initialization process is successful.

· The maximum altitude of the sUAS is limited to 400 feet and it has the capability to create
           a geo/virtual fence, restricting its horizontal movement. This will allow the pilot in command
           to create a pre-planned flight area-beyond from which the sUAS can't operate.

· Battery strength is displayed on the hand-held, control box allowing for continuous
          monitoring by the pilot in command (PIC). In addition, the control box is equipped
          with low-level battery warning lights and is designed to vibrate and/or send an audible
          alert as the flight battery becomes diminished, thus warning the pilot in command (PIC)
          to land the sUAS.

· The sUAS is equipped with a "Home Mode" function. Once activated, the sUAS will land
          automatically within 13-26 feet of the pilot in command (PIC).

                                                                    8
Furthermore, the sUAS will only be operated within a secure and controlled area. Receipt of permission
from the landowner will always be obtained prior to flight. In addition, any potential persons within
this restricted area will not be exposed to these operations without their pre-obtained consent. Finally, we
propose that a visual observer (VO) be utilized for each flight and be in verbal communication with the
pilot in command (PIC) during its duration.

Taken together, the sUAS to be operated hereunder weighs less than 5 pounds (apx. 60oz.) at lift-off. It
carries no pilot or passengers. It carries no explosive materials, flammable fuels or other liquids. It will
operate, exclusively, within a secured and restricted area. It is equipped with a number of features that
greatly minimize the risks posed by human error and an additional party will be present to visually
monitor the flight in addition to the pilot in command (PIC). For these reasons, the Petitioner believes that
the risks associated with the operation ofthe sUAS are so diminished from the level of risk associated
with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61, that allowing operations of the sUAS as requested
with a private pilot as the pilot in command (PIC) exceeds the present level of safety as contemplated by
14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b).

The FAA has issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 61.113, a sampling includes the following
exemptions: 11062, 1106311109, 11215, 11227, 11229, 11239, 11241,11258, 11283, 11286, 11335.

14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft airworthiness.

Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a). This regulation requires that a civil aircraft be in
an airworthy condition in order to be operated. In the event that the exemption be granted allowing
commercial operation of sUAS without an airworthiness certificate, no FAA regulatory standard will exist
for determining airworthiness.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Petitioner proposes to operate a sUAS with a lift-off, gross weight of less than 5 pounds (apx. 60oz.) and
it will not be flown unless it has been maintained and prepared in accordance with all specifications and
requirements identified by the manufacturer. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by ensuring
compliance with the sUAS instruction manual and quick start guide, attached in the Appendix to this
application.

The FAA has issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91. 7(a), a sampling includes the following
exemptions: 11062, 11063, 11064, 11065, 11066, 11067, 11080, 11109, 11110, 11136, 11138,11150,

14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.

· Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b) (2):

          (b). No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft...

          (2). For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by§ 21.5 of this chapter
          Unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual
          Approved manual material, markings, and placards, or any combination thereof.

                                                                       9
Petitioner's sUAS has a take-off, gross weight ofless than 5 pounds (apx. 60oz.). Given the size of the
sUAS, it has no ability to place or carry such a flight manual onboard the aircraft. Furthermore, there will
be no pilot on board and no room or capacity to carry this item onboard the aircraft.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping the sUAS instruction manual at the ground
control point where the pilot in command (PIC) flying the sUAS will have immediate access to it. The
FAA has issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b)(2), a sampling includes the following
exemptions: 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 1016710167A, 10602, 10700, 11062, 11063,
11064, 11065, 11066, 11067, 11080, 11109, 11110, 11111, 11112, 11114, 11136, 11138, 11150, 11153,
11156, 11157, 11062, 11063, 11080, 11109, 11153, 11174.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration.

· Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 91.203(a) and (b):

          (a). Except as provided in§ 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within it
               the following:

          (1). An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

          (b). No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
               Paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under § 91.714 is
               Displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible.

Petitioner's sUAS has a take-off, gross weight ofless than 5 pounds (apx. 60oz.). Given its size, the
sUAS has no ability to carry certification and/or registration documents, nor is there a place to display
them. Furthermore, there is no pilot onboard, nor are there passengers or a crew.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground control point
where the pilot in command (PIC) flying the sUAS will have immediate access to them. The FAA has
issued several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) & (b), a sampling includes the following exemptions:
9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, 10700, 11062, 11080, 11109, 11153, 11174.

14 C.F.R § 91.103: Preflight Action.

This regulation requires each pilot in command (PIC) to become familiar with specific information before
each flight, including information contained in the FAA-approved flight manual on board the aircraft. As
FAA approved rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided for the aircraft an exemption will be needed.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be provided as set forth on pages 4-5 and 20-27 of the instruction
manual as well as the quick start guide (both are attached within the Appendix to this application). The
pilot in command (PIC) will take all required preflight actions-including reviewing weather, flight battery
requirements, landing and takeoff distances and aircraft performance data before initiation of flight.
Furthermore, the sUAS instruction manual will be kept at the ground control point where the pilot flying
the sUAS will have immediate access to it.

                                                                10
14 C.F.R. § 91.109: Flight Instruction.

Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.P.R.§ 91.109(a), this regulation provides that "no person may
operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that is being used for flight instruction
unless that aircraft has fully functional dual controls." sUAS and remotely piloted aircraft, by their design
do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control is accomplished through the use of a hand-held,
control box that communicates with the aircraft via radio communications.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Given the size and speed of the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon sUAS, an equivalent level of safe training can be
performed without dual controls because no pilot or passengers are aboard the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon
sUAS. In addition, the system is equipped with an automatic "Home Mode" that can be activated at any
time in response to unusual and unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, all persons will remain a safe
distance away should the sUAS experience any difficulties during flight instruction. Finally, the aircraft's
light weight and slow speeds with no pilot or passengers on board will create less of a danger to the
public than a conventional aircraft equipped with dual controls. The FAA has issued exemptions for flight
training withoutfully functional dual controls for a number ofaircraft and also for flight instruction in
experimental aircraft. Exemptions include: 5778K, 9862A, 11062.

14 C.F.R. § 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitude.

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the minimum safe altitude requirements of 14 C.F.R. § 91.119.
Specifically, § 91.119(c) limits aircraft flying over areas other than congested areas to an altitude of 500
feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may
not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle or structure. In addition, section
91.119(d) will allow a helicopter to operate at less than those minimum altitudes when it can be operated
"without hazard to persons or property on the surface", provided that "each person operating the
helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA."
Because aerial monitoring and inspection work must be conducted at relatively low altitudes and
sometimes at altitudes less than 500 feet, an exemption from 14 C.P.R.§ 91.119(c) is requested.

Equivalent Level of Safety

In comparison to flight operations conducted with rotorcraft weighing far more than the Yuneec Q500
Typhoon sUAS and given the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less
than those that are presently allowed with conventional aircraft. An equivalent level of safety will be
achieved given the size, weight, speed, and material of which the sUAS is constructed as well as the
location where it will be operated. As described in the instruction manual, the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon
sUAS will always be operated within a "geo-fenced", restricted area and no flight will take place without
the permission of the landowner or those who control the land. Additionally, any potential buildings and
people within this restricted area will not be exposed to these operations without their pre-obtained
consent. Furthermore, by operating at a lower altitude, the sUAS will effectively maintain separation with
the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with 14 C.P.R. § 91.119. The FAA has issued to
several exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91.119(c,) a sampling includes the following: 11162, 11163, 11164,
11165, 11166, 111080, 11109, 11110, 11111,11112, 11114, 11136, 11138, 11150, 11153, 11174, 11215,
11227, 11229, 11239, 11258 and 11335.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121 Altimeter Settings.

                                                                   11
Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.121, which requires the person operating an aircraft to
maintain cruising altitude or flight level by reference to an altimeter that is set to the elevation of the
departure airport or barometric pressure. An exemption is sought because the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon
sUAS does not have a barometric altimeter, but rather a GPS altitude read-out.

Equivalent Level of Safety
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by following the procedures set forth in the sUAS
instruction manual. The pilot in command (PIC) will be able to confirm the altitude of the launch site, as
it will be shown on the GPS altitude indicator (located on the hand-held, flight control box) before the
flight takes place. Furthermore, the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon sUAS is pre-programmed for a maximum
altitude limited to 400 feet AGL. In addition, the pilot in command (PIC) will be able to continuously
monitor the altitude of the sUAS throughout the flight, as it is displayed on the hand-held, flight control
box. Thus ensuring that the sUAS will only be operated at a safe altitude.

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a) Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions.

Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a)'s fuel requirements for flight in VFR (Visual
Flight Rule) conditions. Accordingly, § 91.151 states:

· (a). No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless (considering wind
          and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing
          and, assuming normal cruising speed -

          (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes: or

          (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

The battery powering the Yuneec Q500 Typhoon sUAS provides for approximately 20-25 minutes of
powered flight. Because of this, it is impossible to meet the 30 minute reserve requirement set forth in 14
C.F.R. § 91.151(a). However, given the limitations on the sUAS's proposed flight area(s), the location of
its operation within a predetermined area and the construction of the sUAS, an exemption from 14 C.F.R.
§ 91.151(a) is required.

Equivalent Level of Safety

Petitioner believes that an exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a) is warranted. Operating the
Yuneec Q500 Typhoon sUAS, without 30 minutes of reserve fuel does not engender the type of risks that
§ 91.151(a) was intended to prevent given the size (less than 5 lbs.), speed (top speed apx. 25 knots) and
light-weight materials of which the sUAS is constructed. Furthermore, the fact that it carries no pilot,
passengers or cargo also enhances its safety. Operation will be limited to a controlled area where only
people that have signed waivers will be pennitted. The pilot in command (PIC) of the sUAS will able to
continuously monitor the strength of the battery, as it is always displayed on the hand-held, flight control
box. Once the battery strength is indicated as "low" on the flight control box, the pilot in command (PIC)
will simply land the sUAS. As an additional safeguard, the "Home Mode" function of the sUAS can be
programmed to operate in conjunction with low battery strength, so the sUAS can be programmed to
automatically "land" once a predetermined amount of battery strength has been utilized. The FAA has
issued similar exemptions to 14 C.F.R. § 91.151 (a) including exemption nos. 2689F, 5745, 10673 and
10808.

14 C.F.R. § 91.405(a), 407(a) (1), 409(a) 2, 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections.

                                                              12
14 C.F.R § 91.405(a) requires that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart E ofthis part and shall between required inspections, except as provided in
paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in Part 43 of this chapter... "
§ 91.407(a) (1) also makes reference to requirements in Part 43. § 91.409(a) (2) requires an annual
inspection for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate.§ 91.417(a) requires the aircraft owner or
operator to keep records showing certain maintenance work that has been accomplished by certificated
mechanics, under Part 43 or licensed pilots and records of approval of the aircraft to return to service. An
exemption to these regulations is needed because Part 43 and these sections apply only to aircraft with an
airworthiness certificate, which the sUAS will not have.

Equivalent Level of Safety

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because the sUAS is nearly maintenance free. The sUAS
will perform several automatic preflight checks, prior to take-off and a failure of any one of them will act
to prevent flight. Visual pre-flight checks that cannot be performed by the system will also be perfonned
prior to each flight. These pre-flight checks will include an inspection of the airframe, an inspection of the
rotors and the inspection of all batteries (flight battery, control box battery). In the event that maintenance
is required, it will be performed and noted in a maintenance log-specific to the sUAS, which will be kept.
Both pre-flight checks and maintenance will be perfonned by the pilot in command (PIC) as this is the
person most familiar with the aircraft and is best suited to maintain it in an airworthy condition.
Furthermore, in the event that unforeseen mechanical issues arise, the sUAS can land immediately in its
predetermined area of operation. It's small size, lack of pilot, passengers and significant cargo plus the
fact that flight operations will only take place in restricted areas for a limited period of time, create less
risk than the same factors associated with conventional fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft performing the
same operation.

VIII. FEDRAL REGISTER SUMMARY

Pursuant to 14 C.P.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal Register,
should it be determined that publication is needed:

Alex E. Paris Contracting Company, Inc. seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 C.P.R. Part 21, Subpart H; 14 C.P.R. § 91.203(a)(l); 14 C.P.R. § 45.23; 14 C.P.R. § 45.27(a), 14
C.P.R.§ 61.113(a) & (b); 14 C.P.R.§ 91.9(c); 14 C.P.R.§ 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.P.R.§ 203(a) & (b); 14
C.P.R.§ 91.7(a); 14 C.P.R.§ 91.103; 14 C.F.R § 91.109(a); 14 C.F.R § 91.119; 14 C.F.R § 91.121; 14

                                                                  13
C.P.R.§ 121; 14 C.P.R.§ 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R § 91.405(a); 14 C.F.R § 91.407(a)(l); 14 C.F.R §
91.409(a)(2); 14 C.F.R § 91.417(a) & (b).

Approval of these exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUAS within the construction industry
will enhance safety by reducing risk to the general public, property owners and on-site (construction),
personnel. Manned aircraft monitoring and surveying creates a greater risk because the craft are much
larger, carry on-board pilots, passengers and cargo and are also powered by combustible fuels. Similar
monitoring and surveying conducted by on-site, personnel on the ground creates a greater risk due to the
possibility of slips and falls. The operation of a small sUAS, weighing less than 5 pounds and powered by
rechargeable lithium ion batteries will virtually eliminate the risk associated with a craft of larger mass
powered by combustible fuels. Likewise, since the sUAS carries no pilot or passengers, these individuals
will not be exposed to the risks associated with manned flights. Finally, the ability of the sUAS to
monitor areas, difficult to access "on-foot" will reduce the risk of employee injuries due to slips & falls.

All operations of this small sUAS will be conducted according to the strict conditions outlined within this
petition. Accordingly, this will provide a level of safety equivalent to that envisioned by Congress when
these regulations were originally enacted. In general, sUAS operations will be conducted only during
daylight hours in predetermined and restricted areas. Property owners and onsite, personnel will have
received advance notice of these operations and will have consented to them beforehand. The sUAS being
operated weighs less than 5 pounds, will be flown no higher than 400 feet and will travel at slow speeds
of no more than 25 knots. Accordingly, the risk to the property owners, on-site personnel and the general
public is greatly reduced and the risk of interference with other aircraft is minimal.

IX. CONCLUSION

Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 33 of the Refonn Act of2012-size, weight, speed,
operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas, operation within a visual line of sight
and national security-provide more than adequate justification for the grant of the requested exemptions
allowing commercial operation of petitioner's sUAS in the construction industry.

the following parties.
