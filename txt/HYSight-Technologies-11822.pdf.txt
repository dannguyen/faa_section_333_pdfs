                                                           Exemption No. 11822
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1093

Mr. Ryan Anschutz
HYSight Technologies
3282 Oakstone Drive
Ontario, OH 44903

Dear Mr. Anschutz:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 14, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of HYSight Technologies (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct public safety
support; inspection, monitoring, and patrolling; filmmaking, cinematography, and
videography; precision agriculture; and surveying.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI Phantom 3, and
DJI Inspire 1.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, HYSight Technologies is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, HYSight Technologies is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+, DJI Phantom 3, and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds
         including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
         petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day

Re: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations from 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b);14 CFR Part 21;14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b);
91.7 (a);91.9 (b) (2);91.103(b); 91.109;91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a);91.203(a) & (b);91.405
(a); 91.407(a) (1); 91.409 (a) (2);91.417 (a) & (b).

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, HYSight Technologies, operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft
Systems ("sUASs") equipped to offer on-demand commercial UAS operations for a host
of industries and applications. These include:

· Public Safety Support Operations
· Solar field voltaic module inspection
· Utility-power generation system inspections and patrolling,
· Pipeline inspection and patrolling,
· Filmmaking, cinematography, and videography,
· Precision agriculture,
· Wildlife and forestry monitoring,
· Aerial surveying, and
· Construction site inspection and monitoring

HYSight Technologies hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation
Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of its sUASs, so long as such operations
are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the
FAA as required by Section 333

As described more fully below, the requested exemption would permit the operation of
small, unmanned and relatively inexpensive sUAS under controlled conditions in
airspace that is 1) limited 2) predetermined 3) controlled as to access and 4) would
provide safety enhancements to the already safe operations using conventional aircraft.
Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of
Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's) responsibilities to "...establish requirements
for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system." Section
333(c) of the Reform Act.
The name and address of the petitioner is:

Regulations from which the exemption is requested:

14 CFR Part 21
14 C.F.R. 45.23(b)
14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b)
14 C.F.R. 91.7 (a)
14 CFR 91.9 (b) (2)
14 C.F.R. 91.103
14 C.F.R. 91.109
14 C.F. R. 91.119
14 C.F.R. 91.121
14 CFR 91.151 (a)
14 CFR 91.203 (a) & (b)
14 CFR 91.405 (a)
14 CFR 407 (a) (1)
14 CFR 409 (a) (2)
14 CFR 417 (a) & (b)

This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing
Section 333(a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of
Transportation to consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate
safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the rulemaking
required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this determination, the
Secretary is required to determine which types of UASs do not create a hazard to users
of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security in light of the following:

· The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
· Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
· Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.

Reform Act § 333 (a). Lastly, if the Secretary determines that such vehicles "may
operate safely in the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish
requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft in the national airspace system." Id.
§333(c) (emphasis added)
Applicant interprets this provision to place the duty on the Administrator to not only
process applications for exemptions under section 333, but for the Administrator to craft
conditions for the safe operation of the UAS, if it should be determined that the
conditions set forth herein do not fulfill the statutory requirements for approval.
The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions.
This statutory authority by its terms includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is
defined under §40101 of the Act that includes sUASs, from the requirement that all civil
aircraft must have a current airworthiness certificate.
The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed
under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of this title if the
Administrator finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. §44701(f) See also 49
USC §44711(a); 49 USC §44704; 14 CFR §91.203 (a) (1).

HYSight Technolgies sUASs are rotorcraft, weighting 55 or fewer lbs. including payload. They
operate, under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 50 knots and have the
capability to hover, and move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously. They
will operate only in line of sight and will operate only within a sterile area. Such
operations will insure that the sUAS will "not create a hazard to users of the national
airspace system or the public." Specific operational sUASs are the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI
Phantom 3, and DJI Inspire 1. The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI Phantom 3, and DJI Inspire 1
are vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aircraft (UA) with a Ground Control Station
(GCS) utilizing electronic tablet or smart phone systems. The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ and
Phantom 3 have a maximum gross weight of approximately 2 pounds 11 ounces, while having a
length of 16 inches width of 16 inches, height of 8 inches, and maximum speed of approximately
29 knots. The DJI Inspire 1 has a maximum gross weight of 6 pounds 7.5 ounces, a length of
17.3 inches, width of 17.7 inches, height of 11.8 inches, and a maximum speed of approximately
42 knots. The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, Phantom 3, and the DJI Inspire 1 UAs are equipped with
four main rotors; driven by Lithium Polymer battery powered electric motors. The DJI Phantom
2 Vision+, Phantom 3, and DJI Inspire 1 UAs that will be operated by HYSight Technologies
will be registered in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 44103, Registration of Aircraft, as well as 14
C.F.R Part 47, Aircraft Registration, and marked in accordance with 14 C.F.R Part 45,
Identification and Registration Marking.

Reform Act Section 333 (b).
Given the small size of the sUASs involved and the restricted sterile environment within
which they will operate, the applicant falls squarely within that zone of safety (an
equivalent level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by
exemption, allow commercial operations of UASs to commence immediately. Also due to
the size of the UASs and the restricted areas in which the relevant sUASs will operate,
approval of the application presents no national security issue. Given the clear direction
in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal Aviation Act, as
amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and
the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental
impacts, including reduced emissions associated with allowing UASs, the grant of the
requested exemptions is in the public interest.

Accordingly, the applicant respectfully requests that the FAA grant the requested
exemption without delay.
AIRCRAFT AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY
The applicant proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that
have the characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These
limitations provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations
under the current regulatory structure because the proposed operations represent a
safety enhancement to the already safe operations conducted with conventional aircraft.
These limitations and conditions to which HYSight Technologies agrees to be bound when
conducting commercial operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

1. The sUAS will weigh less than 55 lbs.
2. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and/or observer.
3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 45 minutes. Flights will be
terminated at 25% battery power reserve should that occur prior to the 45 minute limit.
4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL or, not more than
200 feet above an elevated platform from which filming is planned.
5. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS Pilot, the Visual Observer,
and/or the Camera Operator.
6. sUAS pilot will be an FAA licensed airman with at least a private pilot's certificate and 3rd
class medical certificate.
7. sUAS Pilot will be Pilot in Command (PIC). If a pilot certificate holder other than the
sUAS Pilot, who possess the necessary PIC qualifications, is also present (i.e. the Visual
Observer), that person can also be designated as the PIC.
8. The UAS will only operate within a confined "Sterile Area" of the flight operations area.
9. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to each
day's activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties
within the boundaries of the safety perimeter be present for this briefing.
10. The operator will obtain the consent of all persons involved and ensure that only
consenting persons will be allowed within 100 feet of the flight operation, and this radius
may be reduced to 30 feet based upon an equivalent level of safety determination.
11. Pilot and observer will have been trained in operation of UAS generally and received
up-to-date information on the particular UAS to be operated.
12. Observer and pilot will at all times are able to communicate by voice and/or text.
13. Written and/or oral permission from the relevant property holders will be obtained.
14. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or
city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
agencies.
15. If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UAS will have
capability to return to a pre-determined location within the Security Perimeter and land.
16. The sUAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unpredicted obstacles or
emergencies.
14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 C.F.R. §91.203 (a) (1)
Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements
for the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1). Given
the size and limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by the
Applicant, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements of an
equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal
Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.§44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the
FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon
consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports
and populated areas of the particular UAS. In all cases, an analysis of these criteria
demonstrates that the UAS operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the restricted
environment and under the conditions proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a
conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness certificate
without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

The sUAS to be operated hereunder is less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a
pilot nor passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and
operates exclusively within a secured area as set out in the Manual. Unlike other civil
aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by both
the operator, pursuant to the Manual's requirements, and under the requirements and in
compliance with local public safety requirements, to provide security for the area of
operation as is now done with conventional filming. The FAA will have advance notice of
all operations. These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated
in connection with motion picture and television production, provide a greater degree of
safety to the public and property owners than conventional operations conducted with
airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application
of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security
posed by the UAS, due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack of
explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial external
load. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulations Exemptions Nos. 11251.

14 C.F.R. § 45.23 (b). Marking of the Aircraft
The regulation requires:
When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the registration number is
displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental or
provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near each
entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more
than 6 inches high, the words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or
"provisional," as applicable.
Even though the UAS will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be
needed as the UAS will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which
the word "Experimental" can be placed. Given the size of the sUAV, two-inch lettering
will be impossible. The word "Experimental" will be placed on the fuselage in compliance
with §45.29 (f).
The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the sUAV marked on its
fuselage as required by §45.29 (f) where the pilot, observer and others working with the
sUAV will see the identification of the UAS as "Experimental." The FAA has issued the
following exemptions to this regulation to Exemptions, but not limited to, Nos. 10700, 8738,
10167 and
10167A, 11256, 11251.

14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in
Command.
Sections 61.113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the
sUAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the
equivalent level of safety of current operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft
to have a private pilot's license rather than a commercial pilot's license to operate this
small UAS. Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the sUAS
is remotely controlled with no living thing on board. The area of operation is controlled
and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance. The level of safety
provided by the requirements included in the Manual exceeds that provided by a single
individual holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a conventional aircraft. The
risks associated with the operation of the sUAS are so diminished from the level of risk
associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that
allowing operations of the sUAS as requested with a private pilot as the PIC exceeds the
present level of safety achieved by 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) & (b).

14 C.F.R. §91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.
The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining
airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft and the requirements contained in the
Manual for maintenance and use of safety check lists prior to each flight, as set forth in
Sections J, L and Q, an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.
Section 91.9 (b) (2) provides:
No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft ...
(2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of this
chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved airplane or Rotorcraft
Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or any combination
thereof. The sUAS, given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a
flight manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because
there is no room or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.
The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the
ground control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to it.
The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation, but not limited to: Exemption
Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, 10700,
11251, and 11256.
14 C.F.R. § 91.103: Preflight action
This regulation requires each pilot in command to take certain actions before flight to
insure the safety of flight. As FAA approved rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided
for the aircraft an exemption will be needed. The PIC will take all actions including
reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff distances and aircraft
performance data before initiation of flight.

14 C.F.R. §91.109: Flight instruction:
Section 91.103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned
free balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully
functioning dual controls.
sUASs and remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual
controls. Flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box that
communicates with the aircraft via radio communications. The FAA has approved
exemptions for flight training without fully functional dual controls for a number of aircraft
and for flight instruction in experimental aircraft. See Exemption Nos.5778K & 9862A.
The equivalent level of safety provided by the fact that neither a pilot nor passengers will
be carried in the aircraft and by the size and speed of the aircraft.

14 C.F.R. §91.119: Minimum safe altitudes
Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119 (d)
allows helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the
person operating the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for
helicopters by the FAA. As this exemption is for a sUAS that is a helicopter and the
exemption requests authority to operate at altitudes up to 400 AGL, or not more than
200 above an elevated platform from which filming is planned, an exemption may be
needed to allow such operations. As set forth herein, except for the limited conditions
stated in the Manual, the UAS will never operate at higher than 400 AGL. It will however
be operated in a restricted area with security perimeter, where buildings and people will
not be exposed to operations without their pre-obtained consent. The equivalent level of
safety will be achieved given the size, weight, and speed of the UAS as well as the
location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the required permission of
the property owner or local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property
owner and participants in the aerial activity, all affected individuals will be aware of the
planned flight operations. Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft
weighting far more than the maximum 55lbs. proposed herein and the lack of flammable
fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less than those presently presented
with conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 AGL other industries. In addition, the
low-altitude operations of the sUAS will ensure separation between these small-UAS
operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section
91.119.

14 C.F.R. §91.121 Altimeter Settings
This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure." As the sUAS may not have a
barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed.
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the Manual
and Safety Check list, confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS
altitude indicator before flight.

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions
Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under
VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is
enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising
speed ­ (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly
after that for at least 45 minutes."
The battery powering the sUAS provides approximately 30-50 minutes of powered flight. To
meet the 30-minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR §91.151, sUAS flights would be
limited to approximately 20 minutes in length. Given the limitations on the UAS's
proposed flight area and the location of its proposed operations within a predetermined
area, a longer time frame for flight in daylight or night VFR conditions is reasonable.
Applicant believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) falls within the scope of
prior exemptions. See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to
operate without compliance with FAR 91.151 (a)). Operating the small UAS, in a tightly
controlled area where only people and property owners or official representatives who
have signed waivers will be allowed, with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel, does not
engender the type of risks that Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size
and speed of the small UAS. Additionally, limiting sUAS flights to 20 minutes would
greatly reduce the utility for which the exemption will be granted.
Applicant believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to
45 minutes or 25% of battery power whichever happens first. This restriction would be
more than adequate to return the sUAS to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its
limited operating area.
Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689F,
5745, 10673, 10808, and 11251.

14 C.F.R. §91.203 (a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration
The regulation provides in pertinent part:
(a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has
within it the following:
(1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate. . . .
(b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is
displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.
The UAS fully loaded weighs no more than 55 lbs and is operated without an onboard
pilot. As such, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents
or to display them on the sUAS.
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to them, to the
extent they are applicable to the sUAS. The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to
this regulation. A representative sample of other exceptions includes Exemption Nos.
9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, 10700, 11251, and 11256.

14 C.F.R. §91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections
These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections,
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as
prescribed in part 43 of this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in
compliance with Part 43.

Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to the applicant. The operator pursuant to the
flight manual and operating handbook will accomplish maintenance. An equivalent level
of safety will be achieved because these small UASs are very limited in size and will
carry a small payload and operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If
mechanical issues arise the UAS can land immediately and will be operating from no
higher than 400 feet AGL. As provided in the Manual, the operator will ensure that the
UAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform required maintenance, and keep
a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the operator is the person most familiar
with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to
provide the equivalent level of safety.
*********

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:
Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:
14 C.F.R. §21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R 45.23(b);14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113( a) & (b);91.7 (a); 91.9
(b) (2);91.103(b);91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a);91.203(a) and (b); 91.405 (a);
91.407 (a) (1); 91.409 (a) (2); 91.409 (a) (2) and 91.417 (a) & (b) to operate
commercially a small unmanned vehicle (55lbs or less).

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUASs, will enhance safety
by reducing risk. Conventional operations, using jet or piston power aircraft, operate at
extremely low altitudes just feet from the subjects being filmed and in extreme proximity
to people and structures and present the risks associated with vehicles that weigh in the
neighborhood of 4,000lbs, carrying large amounts of jet A or other fuel. Such aircraft
must fly to and from the operational location. In contrast, a sUAS weighing fewer than 55
lbs. and powered by batteries eliminates virtually all of that risk given the reduced mass
and lack of combustible fuel carried on board. The sUAS is carried to the operation site
and not flown. The sUAS will carry no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose
them to the risks associated with manned aircraft flights.
The operation of small UASs, weighting less than 55 lbs., conducted in the strict
conditions outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant
of the exemptions requested herein, including exempting the applicant from the
requirements of Part 21 and allowing commercial operations. These lightweight aircraft
operate at slow speeds, close to the ground, and in a sterile environment and, as a
result, are far safer than conventional operations conducted with turbine helicopters
operating in close proximity to the ground and people.

Privacy
All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's
prior consent and knowledge. Filming will be of people who have also consented to
being filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where filming will take place.
The grant of this exemption request will provide improved safety in both day and night
operations. Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012-
-size, weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas
and operation within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than
adequate justification for the grant of the requested exemptions allowing commercial
operation of applicant's UAS. It is of note that certain public safety operations may involve
advanced monitoring technology such as Infrared Red, Night Vision, etc. These specific
operations will be governed pursuant to all applicable Local, State, and Federal laws regarding
search and seizure including court approval of said operations via search warrant.

Conclusion
As set forth herein, HYSight Technologies seeks an exemption pursuant to 14 C.F.R 11.61 and
Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA), which will permit safe
operation of the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI Phantom 3, and DJI Inspire 1 UASs commercially,
without an airworthiness certificate, for the limited purpose of conducting the aforementioned
on-demand commercial sUAS operations that include:

· Public Safety Support Operations
· Solar field voltaic module inspection
· Utility-power generation system inspections and patrolling,
· Pipeline inspection and patrolling,
· Filmmaking, cinematography, and videography,
· Precision agriculture,
· Wildlife and forestry monitoring,
· Aerial surveying, and
· Construction site inspection and monitoring
By granting this Petition, the FAA Administrator will be fulfilling the Congressional mandate of
the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, while also advancing the interests of the
public, by allowing HYSight Technologies to safely, efficiently, and economically operate
sUASs commercially within the NAS.

WHEREFORE, in accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations and the FAA
Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, section 333, HYSight Technologies respectfully
requests that the Administrator grant this Petition for an exemption from the requirements of 14
C.F.R Sections 45.23(b); Part 21; 61.113(a) & (b), 91.7(a); 91.9(b); 91.103(b); 91.109; 91.119;
91.121; 91.151(a); 91.203(a); 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(1) & (a)(2), and 91.417(a) &
(b), and permit HYSight Technologies to operate the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, DJI Phantom 3,
and the DJI Inspire 1 commercially in the United States.

HYSight Technologies only utilizes safe and reliable sUASs. DJI is an industry leader in small
UAS production. DJI UASs are loaded with ground breaking software enabling the user to set
parameters which will not allow flight into controlled airspace. Parameters can also be set to
limit flight to no higher than a predetermined and set altitude as well as limit flight to a
predetermined and set distance. In addition, DJI software provides real-time altitude and location
information to the PIC via the linked monitor (smart phone/tablet devices)

DJI INSPIRE 1 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

HYSight Technologies only utilizes safe and reliable UASs. DJI is an industry leader in small
UAS production. DJI UASs are loaded with ground breaking software enabling the user to set
parameters which will not allow flight into controlled airspace. Parameters can also be set to
limit flight to no higher than a predetermined and set altitude as well as limit flight to a
predetermined and set distance. In addition, DJI software provides real-time altitude and location
information to the PIC via the linked monitor (smart phone/tablet devices)

STANDARD PROVISIONS

A. General.

1. The approval of this COA is effective only with an approved FAA Grant of Exemption.

2. A copy of the COA including the special limitations must be immediately available to all
    operational personnel at each operating location whenever UAS operations are being
    conducted.

3. This authorization may be canceled at any time by the Administrator, the person
    authorized to grant the authorization, or the representative designated to monitor a
    specific operation. As a general rule, this authorization may be canceled when it is no
    longer required, there is an abuse of its provisions, or when unforeseen safety factors
    develop. Failure to comply with the authorization is cause for cancellation. The operator
    will receive written notice of cancellation.

B. Safety of Flight.

1. The operator or pilot in command (PIC) is responsible for halting or canceling activity in
    the COA area if, at any time, the safety of persons or property on the ground or in the air
    is in jeopardy, or if there is a failure to comply with the terms or conditions of this
    authorization.

See-and-Avoid

Unmanned aircraft have no on-board pilot to perform see-and-avoid responsibilities;
therefore, when operating outside of active restricted and warning areas approved for
aviation activities, provisions must be made to ensure an equivalent level of safety exists
for unmanned operations consistent with 14 CFR Part 91 §91.111, §91.113 and §91.115.

a. The pilot in command (PIC) is responsible:

    · To remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and activities at
         all times,

    · For the safety of persons or property on the surface with respect to the UAS, and

    · For compliance with CFR Parts 91.111, 91.113 and 91.115

b. UAS pilots will ensure there is a safe operating distance between aviation activities
and unmanned aircraft (UA) at all times.

c. Visual observers must be used at all times and maintain instantaneous communication
with the PIC.

d. The PIC is responsible to ensure visual observer(s) are:

                                                     Small UAS Operations 200 feet and below for

FAA FORM 7711-1 UAS COA Attachment  Page 3 of 6
                    FAA-2015-1093

             · Able to see the UA and the surrounding airspace throughout the entire flight, and

             · Able to provide the PIC with the UA's flight path, and proximity to all aviation
                  activities and other hazards (e.g., terrain, weather, structures) sufficiently for the
                  PIC to exercise effective control of the UA to prevent the UA from creating a
                  collision hazard.

         e. Visual observer(s) must be able to communicate clearly to the pilot any instructions
         required to remain clear of conflicting traffic.

    2. Pilots are reminded to follow all federal regulations e.g. remain clear of all Temporary
         Flight Restrictions, as well as following the exemption granted for their operation.

    3. The operator or delegated representative must not operate in Prohibited Areas, Special
         Flight Rule Areas or, the Washington National Capital Region Flight Restricted Zone.
         Such areas are depicted on charts available at
         http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/. Additionally, aircraft operators
         should beware of and avoid other areas identified in Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS)
         which restricts operations in proximity to Power Plants, Electric Substations, Dams,
         Wind Farms, Oil Refineries, Industrial Complexes, National Parks, The Disney Resorts,
         Stadiums, Emergency Services, the Washington DC Metro Flight Restricted Zone,
         Military or other Federal Facilities.

    4. All aircraft operated in accordance with this Certificate of Waiver/Authorization must be
         identified by serial number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have
         identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C.
         Markings must be) as large as practicable.

C. Reporting Requirements

    1. Documentation of all operations associated with UAS activities is required regardless of
         the airspace in which the UAS operates. NOTE: Negative (zero flights) reports are
         required.

    2. The operator must submit the following information through
         mailto:9-AJV-115-UASOrganization@faa.gov on a monthly basis:
