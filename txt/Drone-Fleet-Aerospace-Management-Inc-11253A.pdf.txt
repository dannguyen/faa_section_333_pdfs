                                                      Exemption No. 11253A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0817

Mr. Simon Nielsen
CEO
Drone Fleet & Aerospace Management, Inc.
606 Venice Boulevard, Suite E
Venice, CA 90291

Dear Mr. Nielsen:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letters dated April 23 and June 4, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Drone Fleet & Aerospace Management, Inc. (hereinafter
petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14,
Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. You requested an amendment to conduct closed-set motion picture and
filming and add the Freefly Cinestar 8, DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire, AeroVironment Puma
AE, PrecisionhAwk Lancaster, AirRobot AR180 and AirRobot AR200, and 3D Robotics
Spektre Industrial Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11253
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft and closed-set motion picture and filming to its
UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11253 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft. Condition No.
2 has been updated to permit closed-set motion picture and television filming.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI S1000, DJI
         Phantom 2, Drone-Fleet Carbon Fiber V5, Freefly Cinestar 8, DJI Phantom 3, DJI
         Inspire, AeroVironment Puma AE, PrecisionhAwk Lancaster, AirRobot AR180 and
         AirRobot AR200, and 3D Robotics Spektre Industrial Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         permitted.
                                                                                     3

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.
Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
