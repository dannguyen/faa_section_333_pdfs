                                                          Exemption No. 11467
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0261

Mr. Jeffrey J. Antonelli
Attorney
Antonelli Law
100 North LaSalle Street Suite 2400
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Mr. Antonelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 29, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Aerial Inspection Resources, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct examination and monitoring of power lines, pipelines and related utility
structures.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received one comment in support of the petition made to the docket.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Spreading Wings S1000.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Aerial Inspection Resources LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
                                                                                                                 3

91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform
aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Aerial Inspection Resources, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Spreading
         Wings S1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
                                                                                                            4

    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act)
and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Antonelli Law on behalf of Aerial Inspection Resources LLC ("AIR"), an
operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUAS") equipped to conduct aerial inspection

of utility infrastructure, hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation
Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of its sUASs, so long as such operations

are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the

FAA as required by Section 333. The intended sUAS operations contemplated by this petition

are in the public interest because they clearly satisfy the "Four D's" of exemplary uses of UAS:

to replace work that is Dangerous, Difficult, Dull, or Dirty, and at the same time provide an

equivalent or greater level of safety than alternative manned aircraft operations.

Approval of exemptions for AIR will allow commercial operations of the DJI S1000 to examine
and monitor power lines, pipelines, and structures in Class G airspace nationwide. The requested
exemption should be granted because operation of small UASs, weighing approximately 24.25
lbs. (11 kg.), inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the strict conditions outlined below,
will provide an equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended, while still allowing commercial
operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the exemption are far safer than conventional
operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft weighing thousands of pounds and
carrying highly flammable fuel, and operating in close proximity to the ground, power lines,
transmission towers, pipelines, and people. The seven factors Congress directed the FAA to
consider when approving Section 333 exemption petitions - size, weight, speed, operational
capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated areas, and operation within visual line of
sight ­ each support the request. In particular, the aircraft are small, and will operate at slow

I. Publishable Summary

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 C.F.R 21(h); 14 C.F.R. 43.7; 14 C.F.R. 43.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.11; 14 C.F.R. 45.27; 14
C.F.R. 45.29; 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c); 14 C.F.R.
91.103(b)(2); 14 C.F.R. 91.105; 14 C.F.R. 91.109; 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b); 14 C.F.R.
91.119(b) and (c); 14 C.F.R. 91.121; 14 C.F.R. 91.151; 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b); 14
C.F.R. 215; 14 C.F.R. 91.403; 14 C.F.R. 91.405; 14 C.F.R. 91.407; 14 C.F.R. 409; and 14
C.F.R. 91.417 to operate commercially a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) (25lbs or
less).

    Approval of exemptions for AIR will allow commercial operations of the DJI S1000 to
    examine and monitor power lines, pipelines, and are related utility structures in Class G
    airspace nationwide. The sUAS will collect high resolution still photographs, as well as
    infrared and ultraviolet spectral images, including a light weight Lidar system to collect
    "point cloud" data of these elements. AIR will use the Lidar system to create accurate
    surface elevation models and digital elevation models. The requested exemption should be
    granted because operation of small UASs, weighing approximately 24.25 lbs. (11 kg.),
    inclusive of battery and payload, conducted in the strict conditions outlined below, will
    provide an equivalent level of safety, as Congress intended, while still allowing
    commercial operations. The lightweight aircraft covered by the exemption are far safer than
    conventional operations conducted with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft weighing
    thousands of pounds and carrying highly flammable fuel, and operating in close proximity
    to the ground, power lines, transmission towers, pipelines, and people. The seven factors
    Congress directed the FAA to consider when approving Section 333 exemption petitions -
    size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports, proximity to populated
    areas, and operation within visual line of sight ­ each support the request. In particular, the
    aircraft are small, and will operate at slow speeds, and close to the ground in order to more
    safely and efficiently conduct inspections that would otherwise involve a risk of death to
    the inspectors. The substantial increase of safety and decrease of risk to human life,
    coupled with the low risk use of sUASs to conduct these inspections, weighs heavily in
    favor of granting the exemption.

III. Aerial Inspection Resources LLC's Operations

A. The sUAS

         The requested exemption will permit AIR to operate the DJI S1000, with a maximum
weight of approximately 24.25 lbs. (11 kg), inclusive of batteries and technical payload. This
rotorcraft operates at a speed of no more than 20 knots and has the capability to hover and move
in the vertical and horizontal planes simultaneously.

         The sUAS will have the following specifications or equivalent:

Airframe: DJI S1000
Control System: A2, which includes the Main Controller (MC), Internal Measurement Unit
(IMU) with a built-in internal sensor, barometric altimeter (which measures attitude and
altitude), compass, GPS, and radio receiver (Rx).
Tx: Futaba 8FG
Rx: Internal in A2
Motors: DJI 4114-11
Propellers: DJI-Innovations Composite folding blades with 15" diameter and 5.2" fixed propeller
pitch
Data Link: DJI 2.4 Ghz Data Link
Video Link: DJI 5.8 Ghz
OSD: iOSD Mark II, which allows live telemetry to be displayed to the visual observer,
including the battery level and altitude
Gimbal: Zenmuse
Batteries: Lithium Polymer batteries with capacity of 8,000-42,000 mah

         Please refer to Exhibits 1-9 for further information about the DJI S1000 and A2 control
system and the Futaba 8FG transmitter.

B. Flight Conditions

         The sUAS will be flown in Class G airspace under 400 feet above ground level ("AGL")
and under controlled conditions over property that is restricted as laid out in Exhibit 19, Section
4.4. The sUAS will be used to monitor pipelines, power lines, and condition of transmission
towers nationwide. AIR's work will be monitored by their utility clients. AIR will work with
local FSDO when planning operations. AIR will only operate its sUAS in visual meteorological
conditions (VMC): no less than 500 feet below and no less than 2,000 feet horizontally from a
cloud or when visibility is at least 3 statute miles from the PIC. The flight crew will always make
a safety assessment of the risk of every operation, and will only operate when it is determined
that no undue hazards are present.

         Please refer to the following sections of Exhibit 19 for more information about the flight
conditions:

         4.24: Weather Limits

         10.4: Personnel Responsibilities for Deployments
         11.2: Weather

C. Flight Operations

         The purpose of every sUAS flight will be to safely, accurately, and efficiently aerially
inspect assets such as pipelines, power lines, and transmission towers. The sUAS will collect
high resolution still photographs, as well as infrared and ultraviolet spectral images, including a
light weight Lidar system to collect "point cloud" data of these elements. AIR will use the Lidar
system to create accurate surface elevation models and digital elevation models.

         Every sUAS flight will use at minimum a two person flight crew: a pilot-in-command
(PIC) and a visual observer (VO). The PIC will have, at minimum, a private pilot certificate.
Both the PIC and VO will have sUAS-specific training from AIR prior to becoming employees
as well as annually. For further information, please refer to Exhibit 19, Section 9: Training and
Exhibit 20, submitted confidentially for proprietary reasons for further information.

      The standard operational procedures are set out in Exhibit 19. Please refer to the following
sections for information pertaining to operations:

      4.3: DJI S1000 Setup Checklist
      4.4: DJI S1000 Preflight Checklist
      4.5: DJI S1000 Takeoff Checklist
      4.7: DJI S1000 Landing Checklist
      7.3: Personnel (including the operational duties of the PIC and the VO)
      10.4: Personnel Responsibilities for Deployments
      10.5: Personal Equipment
      10.6: Log Books
      11: Pre-Flight/Post-Flight Actions
      12: Emergency Procedures

      While the majority of flights will be manually piloted, some flights will be preprogrammed
into the DJI S1000 by the PIC. This automated feature will be used when using the Lidar system
in order to obtain the most accurate data for the target area. Throughout automated flights, the
PIC will always hold the transmitter, monitor the telemetry data on the iOSD Mark II, and be
prepared to abort the operation and fly the sUAS manually should an emergency situation occur.
The VO will also be observing the telemetry data on a ground station laptop.

      For manually piloted flights, the PIC will fly the DJI S1000 and the VO will control the
camera collecting high resolution still images.

      Due to the fact that power lines are often adjacent to public highways, AIR will necessarily
operate closer than 500 feet to non-participating individuals. In order to protect these individuals
and provide suitable buffer zones and barriers, AIR will follow the principals set forth in Part 6
of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), as set out by the U.S. Department
of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. AIR's flight crew will also rely on its own
research and knowledge of the area when preparing an operation. Please refer to Exhibit 19,
Section 8.6: Public Notification and Traffic Control and Section 8.7: Checklist for Work Zone
Layout & Operation in Exhibit 19 for further information. AIR will work with the local FSDO to
plan where it will be operating, and it will avoid flying in congested locations.

                                                          7
      AIR has anticipated the possibility for a number of different emergencies, and has
accounted for this in Exhibit 19, Section 12: Emergency Procedures. These procedures will
include, prior to each flight, the setting of a "home spot" in the event of a lost connection with
the DJI S1000.

IV. Privacy

         There is little concern that the proposed flights will cause invasions of privacy because all
flights will occur over public utilities on public or private rights of way. When the sUAS is being
flown, the onboard cameras will be focused on the pipeline or overhead wire, and thus turned so
as to be facing away from any occupied structures that may be in the area to minimize
inadvertent video or still images of uninvolved persons. All data collected will be for private use
only and will not be distributed through public channels. If such data is later made available for
public view, all images containing uninvolved persons will be blurred or blacked-out. No attempt
will be made to identify any individuals filmed during the flights except in cases where they are
trespassing upon or damaging customer property, or interfering with the applicant's or its
customers' operations.

V. Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

         AIR proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at
least an equivalent or higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory structure.

         These limitations and conditions to which AIR agrees to be bound when conducting
commercial operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

  1. The sUAS will weigh approximately 24.25 lbs. (11 kg.).

  2. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and visual observer.

  3. The PIC will have, at minimum, a private pilot's license.

  4. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will result in no less than a 20%
      battery reserve.

  5. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.

  6. Minimum flight crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS pilot and the visual
      observer.

  7. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to each day's
      activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties in
      connection with the operations be present for this briefing.

  8. AIR will submit a written Plan of Activities, and any additional necessary paperwork, to
      the FSDO at least one day before the proposed operations begin.

  9. Pilots are required to possess a second class medical certificate. Pilots are required to
                                                          8
      possess, at minimum, a private pilot certificate, and VOs must have completed training
      with AIR prior to operations.

  10. PICs will complete, at minimum, eight hours of sUAS flight training with AIR prior to
      operations, and will be required to participate in annual training thereafter.

  11. Pilot and observer will have been trained in operation of sUAS generally and received up-
      to-date information on the particular sUAS to be operated.

  12. Pilot and observer will at all times be able to communicate by voice.

  13. Written and/or oral permission from the landowners/authorized agents of the landowners
      over which flights will be held.

  14. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or city
      jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate governmental
      agencies.

  15. The sUAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unexpected obstacles or
      emergencies.

  16. If the sUAS and its radio control link disconnect during flight, the system's failsafe
      protection will be triggered and the multirotor will return to home and land automatically,
      rather than flying off uncontrollably or landing at an unknown location

  17. Approval of commercial flights as outlined in this petition presents no national security
      issue. PICs will possess, at minimum, a private pilot's certificate, so they will have been
      subject to security screenings by the Department of Homeland Security.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size,
weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation
within visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the
grant of the requested exemption allowing commercial operation of applicant's sUAS in the
pipeline and power line inspection industries, pursuant to AIR's rules of operation.

VI. Public Interest and Safety

         The planned sUAS use will increase ground safety for power line and transmission tower
inspections, and pipeline inspections.

         A. Power Line and Transmission Tower Inspections

         Use of the sUAS will increase ground safety. Currently, electrical companies conduct
visual inspections using manned helicopters in very close physical proximity to power lines and
transmission towers. Power lines transmit extremely high voltage electricity and are in both rural
and heavily populated urban areas. All lines need to be inspected, both on the surface and
internally.

         As the FAA has recognized, use of manned helicopters to conduct tasks which could

                                                          9
otherwise be completed with sUASs can be dangerous, as they are large, operated by an onboard
pilot in addition to other onboard crewmembers, carry highly flammable fuel, and are operated
over large distances. Exhibit 10. Inspecting power lines with a manned helicopter is very
dangerous for all the crew members involved as the aircraft is required to fly slowly and very
close to the power lines. Manned helicopters are susceptible to weather patterns as well.

         There have been several instances in recent years in which inspectors and crew members
lost their lives performing such inspections. Three people were killed in an accident in Silt,
Colorado in January 2014. The helicopter struck the power line and crashed, quickly killing all
those on board. Exhibit 11. Two people lost their lives in a similar situation in August 2014 in
Alabama. Exhibit 12. In Texas, in 2013, two transmission line inspectors that were suspended
from the helicopter by large cables were killed when the cables struck the power line and
snapped. Exhibit 13. Moreover, especially in populated areas, the use of manned helicopters to
conduct these inspections creates a substantial risk of injury or death for individuals on the
ground.

         Additionally, use of manned helicopters can be expensive, and is not very reliable ­ "it
can, in fact, provide images only of the upper part of the [electrical] cables, and critical
specifications such as internal corrosion of the steel reinforced aluminum conductors (ACSR)
cannot be detected." Exhibit 14 at 1.

         The use of sUASs to conduct power line inspections will ameliorate many of these
concerns. First, sUASs are significantly safer than manned aircraft. The DJI S1000 weighs no
more than 25 lbs., which is orders of magnitude smaller than a manned helicopter. The pilot and
crew are located on the ground, not hovering hundreds of feet in the air above electrical cables,
risking their lives for the inspection. In the event of a sUAS collision with the power lines, the
crew will be a safe distance from the site of the accident. Many sUASs, including the DJI S1000
that AIR will use, are battery-powered and do not contain flammable liquids. sUASs require less
room for take-off and landings than do manned aircraft, and can be flown for short distances,
which significantly decreases the potential for accidents. sUASs rely on GPS signals and flight
control algorithms that can make them capable of handling more adverse weather safely.

         Second, sUASs are significantly less expensive than manned aircraft to operate, and they
use fuel more efficiently. Third, the DJI S1000 has significantly greater mobility to better
examine the electrical cables and concrete transmission towers. Finally, using a sUAS will allow
inspectors to inspect power lines and transmission towers more quickly than if they were to use a
manned helicopter. This will also decrease the risk to the inspectors, and allow inspectors to
respond more quickly in the event an emergency inspection is needed.

         B. Pipeline Inspections

         AIR also seeks to use the sUAS to conduct pipeline inspections. Currently, for above-
ground operations, the inspectors must walk along the pipeline with sensor equipment. This can
be time consuming, due to the length of pipelines. Inspectors may also have to traverse lengths of
the pipeline in adverse weather and geographic conditions. Additionally, the inspectors may be
exposed to hazardous materials, such as crude oil and natural gas.

         Using a manned, fixed wing aircraft in an attempt to alleviate some of these concerns
creates many of the same risks mentioned in the previous section. Manned aircraft weigh
significantly more than the DJI S1000, and carry both onboard crewmembers, and highly

                                                         10
flammable fuel.

         Using a DJI S1000 equipped with a high resolution camera and Lidar system, as AIR
proposes, will be much safer. The proposed operations will provide a greater level of safety for
inspectors because they are not subject to the hazards associated with manned aircraft, and
because they can stand at a greater distance from the pipelines to avoid exposure from hazardous
materials.

         Additionally, AIR's inspections of underground pipes, conducted with the DJI S1000,
will be important in preventing ruptures of the pipeline system. According to the U.S.
Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(PHMSA), in 2014, there were 29 serious pipeline incidents, and an additional 268 significant
pipeline incidents, with 19 fatalities and 96 injuries.1 Exhibit 15. Additionally, in January 2015
alone, a ruptured pipeline in Montana spilled tens of thousands of gallons of oil into the
Yellowstone River, contaminating the water for thousands of individuals for several days,
forcing the city to rely on bottled water and empty fire hydrants. Exhibit 16. A ruptured pipeline
in North Dakota spilled three million gallons of the saltwater byproduct produced by oil and
natural gas. Exhibit 17.

         AIR's proposed use of the DJI S10000 will greatly expand the ability to conduct
inspections of pipelines. A two-man crew with a sUAS weighing less than 25lbs and which does
not carry flammable fuel will be significantly more efficient in conducting these investigations
than either using a manned helicopter, which will travel a greater distance to the inspection spot,
or a team on foot which cannot move as quickly. This will lead to more area being covered and
problems being identified before devastating ruptures occur.

VII. Regulations from Which Exemption is Requested

A. 14 C.F.R. 21(h): Airworthiness Certificates

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 21(h). This exemption meets the requirements
for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 based on the small size, light weight,
relatively slow speed, and use in controlled rural environments on private land, as described
previously in this petition.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR's proposed exemption meets the requirements for an
equivalent level of safety of this section, pursuant to Section 333, based on the following factors:

     Small size: the DJI S1000 has a diagonal length of 1055 millimeters, 41.53 inches.
     Light weight: 24.25 lbs. (11 kg.).
     Relatively slow speed: 10 m/s (20 knots).

1 The PHMSA defines "serious incidents" as those including a fatality or injury requiring in-
patient hospitalization, but this data excludes first far incidents, which are gas distribution
incidents with a cause of "other outside force damages" and sub-cause of "nearby fire/explosion"
as the primary cause of incident. "Significant incidents" include any of the following conditions,
excluding first fire incidents: (1) fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization; (2)
$50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars; (3) highly volatile liquid releases of 5
barrels or more or other liquid releases of 50 barrels or more; or (4) liquid releases resulting in an
unintentional fire or explosion. Exhibit 15.

                                                         11
     Operational capacity: currently, with the largest battery AIR intends to use, the DJI
         S1000 has a maximum battery life of 25 minutes, and can travel no more than 2,000
         meters from the PIC.

     Proximity to airports: flights will be in Class G airspace.
     Proximity to populated areas: AIR will avoid flying over congested areas, and will work

         with local FSDO to determine safe areas for operations. Local FSDO may carve out areas
         indicated as yellow in the sectional chart and allow AIR to fly in these specifically
         designated carved-out areas. Additionally, when, through necessity, the sUAS will be
         operating near power lines adjacent to populated areas and roads, AIR will follow
         procedures set out by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway
         Administration to provide an adequate buffer and blockade area to protect non-
         participating individuals.
     Operation within visual line of sight: The PIC will always fly the sUAS within his line of
         sight.
     Location: operations will be along pipelines and power lines nationwide. AIR will work
         with local FSDO when planning flights.
     Altitude: no more than 400 feet AGL, but the majority of flights are anticipated at no
         more than 100 feet AGL.
     Restricted area in which the sUAS will be operated: AIR will restrict access to the flight
         operational area by setting out barriers that will prevent nonparticipating individuals and
         vehicles from entering the area. Flights will be aborted if a nonparticipating individual or
         vehicle enters the area.
     Substantial experience of the PIC: as outlined in Exhibit 19, the PIC will have, at
         minimum, a private pilot certificate and a second-class medical certificate. PICs will also
         go through training, as outlined in Exhibit 19, Section 9: Training and Exhibit 20.

B. 14 C.F.R. 43.7: Persons authorized to approve aircraft, airframes, aircraft engines,
         propellers, appliances, or component parts for return to service after maintenance,
         preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 43.7. This part provides, inter alia, that the
holder of a mechanic certificate or a repair station certificate may approve an aircraft, airframe,
aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or component part for return to service.

         Equivalent level of safety: The nature of the sUAS is that of a model aircraft, and AIR's
service technicians will conduct maintenance as outlined in Exhibit 19 and required by the
manufacturer of the sUAS, DJI. Please refer to the following documents:

     Exhibit 19:
             o Section 5: Aircraft Handling, Service, and Maintenance;
             o Section 10.6: Logbooks; and
             o Section 11.6: Maintenance.

     Exhibit 1.

         The capabilities of AIR's service technicians to maintain and repair the sUAS will meet
the requirement for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 for the type of sUAS, its
intended use, and the operating environment.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 43.11. This part provides, inter alia, that
maintenance record entries be maintained and for the listing of discrepancies and placards by
inspectors. The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room for placards to be placed in or on
it and no inspections for sUAS have been certified by FAA at the present time.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR's flight crews will keep log books of all maintenance
and repair at the ground station, as envisioned in the August 8, 2014 Memorandum,
"Interpretation regarding whether certain required documents may be kept at an unmanned
aircraft's control station." Exhibit 18. This request provides an equivalent level of safety as 14
C.F.R. 43.11 because the documentation will be at the ground station with the PIC, where it will
be useable in case of an emergency, rather than with the sUAS.

D. 14 C.F.R. 45.11: Marking of products.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.11. This part provides, inter alia, that the
manufacturers of aircraft, engines, propellers, mark such aircraft, engines, or propellers with an
approved fireproof identification plate. The sUAS, due to its small size, does not have room for
fireproof placards to be placed in it. Any required placards could become hazardous, due to the
additional weight and strain placed on the sUAS.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR's flight crew will keep information related to the sUAS,
including the user manual, at the ground control station and affix its N-Number, once obtained
from the FAA Registration Office, on the "arms" of the sUAS as large as practicably possible.
This exemption provides an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 45.11 because the relevant
documentation will be at the ground station with the PIC, where it will be useable in case of an
emergency, rather than with the sUAS. Additionally, the fuselage is marked with "DJI," the
manufacturer of the sUAS.

E. 14 C.F.R. 45.27: Location of marks; nonfixed-wing aircraft

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.27. The FAA has stated:

         "The petitioner's [UAS] must be identified by serial number, registered in
         accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings in
         accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be as large as
         practicable." Exhibit 10 at 14.

         AIR is prepared to identify its sUASs by serial number, register them in accordance with
14 C.F.R. part 57, and have N-Number markings on the sUASs. However, 14 C.F.R. 45.27
requires that each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that rotorcraft horizontally on both
surfaces of the cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail the marks required by §45.23. The DJI S1000, due
to its small size, does not have a cabin, fuselage, boom or tail to display the marks required by
§45.23.

         Equivalent level of safety: Once AIR receives N-Numbers for its sUASs, it will display
these marks on the "arms" of the aircraft as large as practicably possible. This exemption

                                                         13
provides an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 45.27 because the sUASs will be registered
with the FAA Aircraft Registration Branch. In the event of incident, the sUAS will be traceable
to AIR.

F. 14 C.F.R. 45.29: Size of marks

         The FAA has previously determined that relief from this section is not necessary, so long
as the sUAS in question is registered with the FAA and markings are as large as practicably
possible. Exemption No. 11136 at 13. AIR requests the FAA make the same determination for
this petition.

         Alternatively, AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 45.27. This part provides, inter
alia, at subpart (3) that the registration marks for rotorcraft must be at least 12 inches high. The
sUAS, due to its small size, does not have any surface area large enough to display marks
anywhere near 12 inches high.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIRS will affix its registration numbers as large as
practicably possible on its "arms" once it obtains N-Numbers for its sUASs. This exemption
provides an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 45.29 because the sUAS will be registered
with the FAA Aircraft Registration Branch. In the event of incident, the sUAS will be traceable
to AIR.

G. 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

         The FAA has previously stated that no exemption is required for this section. Exhibit 10
at 19. AIR requests the same determination to be made for this Petition.

         Alternatively, AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a). The regulation requires
that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition. As there will be no
airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft should this exemption be granted, no standard will
exist for determining airworthiness.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will keep the DJI S1000's maintenance and safety
information at the ground station, where it will be readily accessible to the PIC and VO before,
during, and after operations. The PIC will be able to reference this material when making the
determination regarding airworthiness of the DJI S1000. This exemption provides an equivalent
level of safety as 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) because the PIC will be able to make the determination of
whether the sUAS is in an airworthy mechanical and electrical condition, in accordance with 14
C.F.R. 91.7(b).

H. 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard
         requirements.

         The FAA previously stated that exemption to this section was not necessary. Exhibit 10
at 19. AIR requests the same determination to be made for this Petition.

         Alternatively, AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2). This part provides:

         "(b) No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft...
                                                         14
         (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
         this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved Airplane or
         Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
         any combination thereof."

         First, there does not currently exist a method of approving manuals for sUAS. Second,
given the size and configuration of the sUAS, there is no space to carry such a flight manual on
the aircraft. In addition, carrying the manual on the aircraft would be pointless, since there is no
pilot or other person on board who could read or use it. On August 8, 2014, the FAA issued a
memorandum entitled "Interpretation regarding whether certain required documents may be kept
at an unmanned aircraft's control station." This document stated that in the case of sAUS,
"maintaining these documents at the pilot's control station would meet the intent of the rule as
the pilot would be able to produce the documents for his or her own information or to an FAA
inspector." Exhibit 18.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will keep its flight manual at the ground station, where
both the PIC and VO can access it. An equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2) is
provided because the intent of this rule ­ the pilot having access to this material during flight ­ is
met.

I. 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements.

         The FAA has previously determined that relief from this section is not necessary.
Exemption No. 11136 at 16. AIR requests the FAA to make the same determination about its
petition.

         Alternatively, AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c). This part provides: "(c)
No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft unless that aircraft is identified in
accordance with part 45 of this chapter."

         As stated above, AIR will obtain N-Numbers from the FAA Registration Office and the
sUASs, due to its small size, does not have room to contain fireproof placard or to display
aircraft marks in a conventional size. However, once AIR obtains its N-Numbers, it will place
the number on the "arms" of the aircraft as large as practicably possible.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will obtain N-Numbers from the FAA Registration
Office and affix it to the "arms" of the aircraft as large as practicably possible. An equivalent
level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.9(c) is met because the sUASs will be registered with the FAA
and identifiable in the event of an incident.

J. 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2): Preflight action.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.103(b)(2) to the extent that it is applicable.
This part provides:

         "Each pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all
         available information concerning that flight. This information must include--... (b)
         For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following

                                                         15
         takeoff and landing distance information: ... (2) For civil aircraft other than those
         specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, other reliable information appropriate
         to the aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under expected values of airport
         elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and temperature."

         AIR's flight crew in fact will, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all
available information concerning that flight, as outlined in Section 11 of Exhibit 19. As the
flights of the sUAS will not be at airports, the information required of Part 91.103(b)(2) does not
apply.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR shall perform preflight operations as outlined previously
in this petition, and flights will not be at airports. An equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R.
91.103(b)(2) will be met because the PIC and VO will become familiar with the conditions prior
to the flight, as outlined in Exhibit 19, Section 11.2: Weather and 11.4: Planning.

K. 14 C.F.R. 91.105: Flight crewmembers at stations.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.105 since this part is not applicable due to
the sUAS carrying no flight crewmembers.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will not operate the aircraft unless someone is at the
radio controls at all times. This will provide an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.105
because the flight crew will be at their stations at all times during the flight. The stations will not
be on the aircraft but on the ground.

L. 14 C.F.R. 91.109: Flight instruction; Simulated instrument flight and certain flight
         tests.

         The FAA has previously stated that relief from this section was unnecessary when there
are no training scenarios in which a dual set of controls would be utilized or required. Exhibit 10
at 20. AIR requests the same determination to be made here.

         Alternatively, AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.109. Section 14 C.F.R.
91.109 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that is
being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls. Remotely
piloted aircraft, including the DJI S1000 here, are designed and constructed without dual
controls. Flight control will be accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates
with the aircraft via a radio transmitter.

         Equivalent level of safety: The requested exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.109 will provide
an equivalent level of safety to this section because AIR's training will not require dual controls.
Rather, training will take place as outlined in Exhibit 19, Section 9: Training and in the AIR
UAS Training Syllabus. Additionally, the DJI S1000 is a small sUAS and will carry neither a
pilot nor passengers.

M. 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b): Right-of-way rules: Except water operations.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 113(b) to the extent that it applies to overhead
aircraft operating at or above 500 feet AGL as the sUAS will be operating no higher than 400

                                                         16
feet AGL. This part provides:

         "(b): General. When weather conditions permit, regardless of whether an
         operation is conducted under instrument flight rules or visual flight rules,
         vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and
         avoid other aircraft. When a rule of this section gives another aircraft the right-of-
         way, the pilot shall give way to that aircraft and may not pass over, under, or
         ahead of it unless well clear."

         For example, if another aircraft is operating overhead at 10,000 feet AGL there is no
danger posed to that other aircraft if the sUAS is operating under it or ahead of it at or beneath
400 feet AGL. Despite this, should another aircraft enter the area in which AIR is operation,
because the flight will be within his or her line of sight, the PIC will be able to give right of way
to that aircraft.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will operate its sUAS to see and avoid and give way to
other aircraft that might enter nearby airspace at or below 400 feet AGL, and will give right-of-
way to manned aircraft. Additionally, inspections of power lines and transmission towers will
not interfere with manned flight, because they are pre-existing structures that pilots will not be
flying near.

         Regardless of the type of inspection being conducted, this exemption will provide an
equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.113(b) because the sUAS has significantly greater
mobility than a much larger, manned aircraft. As a result, the PIC will be able to react and
respond to avoid any collision much more quickly than the other pilot.

N. 14 C.F.R. 91.119(b) and (c): Minimum safe altitudes: General.

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.119 subpart (c). This regulation provides:

         "Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft
         below the following altitudes...

         (b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over
         any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle
         within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.

         (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface,
         except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft
         may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or
         structure."

         AIR will not operate the sUAS any higher than 400 feet AGL. Furthermore, AIR will
necessarily operate its sUASs closer than 500 feet to the power lines and the pipelines it will be
inspecting. As outlined in Exhibit 19, Section 8: Safety, AIR will follow the principals set forth
in Part 6 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), created by the U.S.
Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to ensure safety when it will
necessarily be flying closer than 500 feet to traffic.

                                                         17
         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will operate the sUAS no higher than 400 feet AGL.
AIR's sUAS operations, as set out in Section 8 of Exhibit 19, will provide at least an equivalent
level of safety to manned aircraft that are maintaining a distance of at least "500 feet to any
person, vessel, vehicle, or structure." The 400 feet AGL maximum will provide an equivalent
level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.119(c) because, since 1981 with AC 91-57, this height has been
an operating standard for model aircraft.

         As for flying closer than 500 feet to "any person, vessel, vehicle or structure," the
proposed exemption will provide an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.119(c) because
non-participating individuals will be protected by barriers, as set out in Part 6 of the MUTCD.
The barriers will sufficiently protect nonparticipating individuals in the event of an accident. The
FAA has previously granted a similar exemption request in Exemption Nos. 11136 and 11138.
Additionally, the flight crew will make a safety assessment prior to each operation regarding the
risks of operating in a certain area, and only operate when the risk does not present an undue
hazard to themselves or to others.

O. 14 C.F.R. 91.121: Altimeter Settings

         AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.121. This Part provides guidelines for
altimeter use in maintaining the cruising altitude or flight level of the aircraft. AIR is not
requesting a general exemption from the requirement that its sUAS have an Altimeter. The DJI
S1000's flight controller will have an internal measurement unit ("IMU"). The IMU has a built-
in internal sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both attitude and altitude. Exhibit 5,
page 12. Rather, AIR requests an exemption from the requirement to set its altimeter to a station
along the route, or out of an airport, because the DJI S1000 is not traveling point-to-point and is
limited in the distance it can travel from the PIC. Additionally, AIR will not be flying into or out
of an airport.

         Equivalent level of safety: The requested exemption provides an equivalent level of
safety to 14 C.F.R 91.121 because AIR will not operate the sUAS above 400 feet AGL in a
sustained cruising flight mode such as a manned aircraft will typically fly. The PIC will at all
times be controlling the maximum height of the sUAS through the telemetry features of the DJI
iOSD Mark II. Additionally, the sUAS will be operated within the line of sight of the PIC. The
FAA has previously granted this exemption in the MPAA Exemptions. Exhibit 10.

P. 14 C.F.R. 91.151: Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.

        AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. Part 91.151. This Part provides that:

         "(a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
         the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed-- (1)
         During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after
         that for at least 45 minutes.

         (b) No person may begin a flight in a rotorcraft under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to
         the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly
         after that for at least 20 minutes."

                                                         18
         The sUAS AIR will fly is powered by electricity, using lithium polymer batteries that
currently have a maximum flight time of 25 minutes. Therefore, due to the limitations of the
batteries, it is currently impossible to comply with Part 91.151. However, the sUAS will be
operated in a manner with at least the equivalent level of safety as a manned aircraft complying
with Part 91.151.

         Operation of a sUAS with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel does not engender the type
of risks that Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate. During the entire flight, the PIC will
always have a visual line of sight of the sUAS, and be able to monitor the battery life via the
telemetry display on the iOSD Mark II. For manually driven flights, the VO will also have a
transmitter linked to the camera as well as an iOSD Mark II to monitor the telemetry display. For
automatic flights, the VO will be monitoring the battery life via the telemetry display on the
laptop at the ground station. Additionally, there will be a timer set to ensure that the flight time
does not exceed 80% of the battery life of the sUAS. Thus, the sUAS will always have enough
power to land safely, given the minimum level of reserve capacity of the batteries.

         Granting an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) is entirely consistent with similar
exemptions already granted to other operations, including the MPAA Exemptions. Exhibit 10.

         Equivalent level of safety: AIR will limit flights to 80% of battery power. The proposed
exemption meets an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.151 because, given the limitations
on AIR's proposed operations and the location of those operations, a reduced minimum power
reserve for flight in daylight VFR conditions is reasonable.

Q. 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b): Civil aircraft: Certifications required.

         The FAA has previously determined that exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b) is
not necessary. Exhibit 10 at 20.

         Alternatively, AIR requests an exemption from 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a) and (b). This section
provides in part:

         "(a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless
         it has within it the following:

         (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

         (2) An effective U.S. registration certificate issued to its owner...

         (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate
         required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued
         under § 91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to
         passengers or crew."

         First, there are currently no procedures in effect for providing airworthiness certificates
for sUAS. However, as a condition to the approval of exemption, AIR will display N-Numbers,
once received, on the sUASs. Additionally, the flight crew will keep the DJI S1000 and the AIR
UAS manuals at the ground station.

                                                         19
         Second, AIR will use the DJI S1000, which has an equivalent level of safety as a manned
aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. This sUAS provides a number of safety features,
including the automatic return to home failsafe. This will be set as laid out in Exhibit 19, Section
4.4: DJI S1000 Preflight Checklist.

         Because of the use of GPS with the sUAS, the operator will set the initial location of
flight takeoff ("home position") and if the radio control link is broken, the autopilot system will
recognize this broken control link and cause the sUAS to automatically return to the home
position as recorded by the GPS instrumentation. Please refer to Exhibit 5, page 30 of that
document for more information regarding this failsafe procedure. Additionally, because the
sUAS team will mark off an area with traffic cones that has a 20 ft. radius, approximately 30 ft.
from the operators, that will be used as the "home position" for the sUAS to return, no one will
be standing in the way of the path.

         These enhancements and procedures provide a greater degree of safety to the public and
property owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued
under Subpart H. Application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat
to national security posed by the UAS, due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation,
lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial payload.

         In the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed, operation of the sUAS
will be at least as safe as a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an
airworthiness certificate.

         Equivalent level of safety: The DJI S1000 is less than 25 lbs. inclusive of batteries and
technical payload, carries neither a pilot nor passengers, and carries no explosive materials or
flammable liquid fuels. It will be tightly controlled and monitored by the operator and the
observer, and in compliance with local public safety requirements, in order to provide security
for the area of operation. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations because AIR will
notify both ATC and the local FSDO prior to operations, as described previously in this petition.
Granting the proposed exemption will achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R.
91.203(a) and (b) because the operators will be safely on the ground, rather than in a helicopter
hovering above power lines or walking on foot in adverse weather along pipelines.

R. 14 C.F.R. 91.215: ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use

         This section requires that installed Air Traffic Control (ATC) transponder equipment
must meet specific performance and environmental requirements, and aircraft must be equipped
with an operable coded radar beacon transponder.

         There are presently no known commercially available ATC transponders that meet the
payload requirements of a sUAS and are available at reasonable cost. However, because the
sUASs used by AIR will not be flying into or near airports, and will fly no higher than 400 feet
AGL, there is very low risk of collision with any manned aircraft. In addition, because there will
be no need to have contemporaneous communication with ATC Control, due to the short
distances, short flight times, and restricted altitude the sUASs will operate within, AIR requests
an exemption from this section. Additionally, the sUAS is too small to contain ATC transponder
equipment in any form that is known to be available commercially.

                                                         20
         Equivalent level of safety: An equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.215 will be met
because AIR will not fly its sUAS into or near airports, and all operations will be below 400 feet
AGL, so there is very low risk of collision with any manned aircraft. AIR will contact local ATC
before operations to issue a NOTAM, and the local FSDO with its flight plan, as described
previously in this petition. AIR also will give right of way to any manned aircraft that do appear.

S. 14 C.F.R. 91.403: General

         This section requires that the owner or operator of an aircraft is primarily responsible for
maintaining that aircraft in an airworthy condition. AIR will adhere to this requirement.
However, this Section also limits maintenance to that "prescribed in this subpart and other
applicable regulations, including part 43 of this chapter." Because of this limitation, and because
of the exemptions under Part 43 requested above, AIR requests an exemption from this Section.

         This exemption meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to
Section 333 based on the small size, light weight, relatively slow speed, controlled area, and use

         Equivalent level of safety: To achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.403,
AIR will maintain its sUAS in an airworthy condition and adhere to all manufacturer
requirements for inspecting and maintaining the DJI S1000. AIR's service technicians will
conduct maintenance as outlined in Exhibit 19 and required by the manufacturer of the sUAS,
DJI. Please refer to the following documents:

     Exhibit 19
             o 5: Aircraft Handling, Service, and Maintenance;
             o 10.6: Logbooks; and
             o 11.6: Maintenance.

     Exhibit 1

         The maintenance records will be available to the flight crew before, during, and after
operations.

T. 14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a) and (d): Maintenance Required

         The FAA has previously determined that relief from 14 C.F.R. 91.405 is warranted.
Exhibit 10 at 15. This section requires that aircraft be inspected as prescribed by Section E, 14
C.F.R. §§91.401-91.421. As shown below, AIR is applying for an exemption for these sections,
due to the fact that its operators will inspect the sUAS prior to each flight and keep maintenance
records of all parts that are replaced. Because the Sections discussed below are concerned with
manned aircraft, and as such have inspection requirements designed for the safety of passengers,
they are inapplicable to AIR.

         AIR is also applying for an exemption to subpart (d) of this section, which requires a
placard to be installed and references §43.11. As noted previously, AIR requests an exemption to
the placard requirement, because, due to the small size of the sUAS, there is no room to place the
placard.

         Despite the requested exemption from subparts (a) and (d) of this section, AIR will
follow subparts (b) and (c) of this subpart.

                                                         21
         Equivalent level of safety: To achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R.
91.405(a) and (b), AIR will keep logbooks detailing all inspection, maintenance, and repairs to
the sUAS. AIR will also follow DJI's guidelines for inspection and maintenance. As the FAA
has determined in Exemption Nos. 11136 and 11138, following the manufacturer's guidelines
will achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.405(a) and (d), because of the small
size of the sUAS in question and the limited nature of operations.

U. 14 C.F.R. 91.407: Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,
         or alteration

         The FAA has previously determined that relief from 14 C.F.R. 91.407 is warranted.
Exhibit 10 at 14. This section prevents any aircraft from operation that "has undergone
maintenance, preventative maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration unless (1) [i]t has been
approved for return to service by a person authorized under § 43.7 of this chapter; and (2) [t]he
maintenance record entry required by §43.9 or §43.11, as applicable, of this chapter has been
made."

         However, AIR has requested an exemption from §§ 43.7 and 43.11 as described
previously. The capability of the operators to maintain and repair the sUAS meets the
requirements for an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 for both the type of sUAS,
its intended use, and the rural operating environment. Additionally, due to the small size of the
sUAS, there is no room to place inspection placards.

         Therefore, because AIR has requested an exemption from 43.7 and 43.11, AIR
respectfully requests an exemption from 91.407.

         Equivalent level of safety: The proposed exemption will meet an equivalent level of
safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.407 because AIR will regularly inspect and maintain its sUASs in
accordance with the DJI S1000 and AIR UAS manuals. AIR will keep detailed inspection and
maintenance records that will be available to the flight crew before, during, and after operations.
Please refer to the following sections of Exhibit 19 for further information:

          5: Aircraft Handling, Service, and Maintenance;
          10.6: Logbooks; and
          11.6: Maintenance.

V. 14 C.F.R. 91.409: Inspections

         The FAA has previously determined that relief from 14 C.F.R. 91.409 is warranted.
Exhibit 10 at 15. This section lays out specific requirements for inspections of aircraft. AIR
requests an exemption from these requirements because they are intended to maintain the safety
of manned aircraft significantly larger and capable of significantly longer flights than is sUAS.

         Equivalent level of safety: As discussed above and in Exhibit 19, AIR has an inspection
procedure that provides an equivalent level of safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.409. Please refer to Exhibit
19, Section 5.3: Preventative Maintenance, and Section 11.1: Inspections for further information.

                                                         22
W. 14 C.F.R. 91.417: Maintenance records
         The FAA has previously determined that relief from 14 C.F.R. 91.417 is warranted.

Exhibit 10 at 15. AIR requests an exemption from this Section, as it is only applicable for aircraft
with an airworthiness certificate. Because AIR will not have an airworthiness certificate, this
Section is inapplicable.

         Equivalent level of safety: The requested exemption will meet an equivalent level of
safety to 14 C.F.R. 91.417 because AIR will keep detailed maintenance records, as described in
Exhibit 19, Section 11.6: Maintenance. The detailed maintenance records will be accessible to
the PIC and the VO before, during, and after operations.

INTELLIGENT ORIENTATION
CONTROL (IOC)

In course lock flying, the forward direction is the same as a recorded nose direction. See the following figures

Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC),
wherever the nose points, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction:

In home lock flying, the forward direction is the same as the direction from home point to the multi-rotor. See the
following figures

                                                HOME POINT                  HOME LOCK

POINT OF INTEREST (POI)

A2 has a POI function: Point of Interest. When the GPS signal is good, users can record the current position of the aircraft as a point of interest by a preset
switch on the remote control. The aircraft can achieve a circling flight around the point of interest with the nose pointing at the POI in an area of 5 meters
to 500 meters radius, when the roll command is given. This function is easy to set and simple to operate, it is suitable for all-round shooting of a fixed
scenic spot.

INTELLIGENT
LANDING GEAR FUNCTION

Once you enabled the Intelligent Landing Gear function in the assistant software, the
landing gear is default at the Lower position when the aircraft is on the ground; and
the system will lower the landing gear in emergency, motor failure or auto landing, to
protect the aircraft and gimbal; you can control to lower or retract the landing gear by
a switch when the aircraft altitude is over 5m from the ground.

(b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR). The proposed exemption, if granted,
would allow operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for the purpose of scripted,
closed-set filming for the motion picture and television industry.

The petitioner requests relief from the following regulations:

       Part 21 prescribes, in pertinent part, the procedural requirements for issuing and
       changing design approvals, production approvals, airworthiness certificates, and
       airworthiness approvals.

       Section 45.23(b) prescribes, in pertinent part, that when marks include only the Roman
       capital letter "N" and the registration number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-
       sport category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator

AFS-14-320-E

                                          42
                                                2
must also display on that aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot
station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words
"limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as applicable.

Section 61.113(a) and (b) prescribes that--

          (a) no person who holds a private pilot certificate may act as a pilot in
              command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for
              compensation or hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as
              pilot in command of an aircraft.

          (b) a private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an
              aircraft in connection with any business or employment if:

                   (1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and

                   (2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation
                       or hire.

Section 91.7(a) prescribes, in pertinent part, that no person may operate a civil aircraft
unless it is in an airworthy condition.

beginning a flight, become familiar with all available information concerning that
flight, to include--

          (a) For a flight under IFR or a flight not in the vicinity of an airport, weather
              reports and forecasts, fuel requirements, alternatives available if the
              planned flight cannot be completed, and any known traffic delays of which
              the pilot in command has been advised by ATC;

          (b) For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following
              takeoff and landing distance information:

                       and

                                               43
                                                3
                   (2) For civil aircraft other than those specified in paragraph (b)(1) of

                       this section, other reliable information appropriate to the aircraft,
                       relating to aircraft performance under expected values of airport
                       elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and
                       temperature.

Section 91.109 prescribes, in pertinent part, that no person may operate a civil aircraft
(except a manned free balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that
aircraft has fully functioning dual controls.

Section 91.119 prescribes that, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person
may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:

          (a) Anywhere. An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency

              the aircraft.

          (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface,
              except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the
              aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel,
              vehicle, or structure.

          (d) Helicopters, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control aircraft. If the
              operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the
              surface--

                   (1) A helicopter may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed
                       in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, provided each person
                       operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes
                       specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA; and

                   (2) A powered parachute or weight-shift-control aircraft may be
                       operated at less than the minimums prescribed in paragraph (c) of
                       this section.

Section 91.121 requires, in pertinent part, each person operating an aircraft to maintain
cruising altitude by reference to an altimeter that is set "to the elevation of the departure
airport or an appropriate altimeter setting available before departure."

                                               44
                                                4

Section 91.151(a) prescribes that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under
VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is
enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal
cruising speed, (1) during the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At
night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes. [emphasis added]

Section 91.203(a) prohibits, in pertinent part, any person from operating a civil aircraft
unless it has within it (1) an appropriate and current airworthiness certificate; and (2) an
effective U.S. registration certificate issued to its owner or, for operation within the
United States, the second copy of the Aircraft Registration Application as provided for
in § 47.31(c). Section 91.203(b) prescribes, in pertinent part, that no person may
operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate or a special flight
authorization issued under § 91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that
it is legible to passengers or crew.

Section 91.405(a) requires, in pertinent part, that an aircraft operator or owner shall
have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of the same part and shall,
between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of the same section,
have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of the chapter.

Section 91.407(a)(1) prohibits, in pertinent part, any person from operating an aircraft

The petitioner supports its request with the following information:

The petitioner has provided the following information ­ contained in its petition and
supplemental proprietary Flight Operations and Procedures Manual (hereafter FOPM) and
Motion Picture and Television Operations Manual (hereafter MPTOM) ­ in support of its
exemption request. The petitioner submitted additional information in response to the FAA's
August 7, 2014 request which is posted to the docket. The FAA has organized the petitioner's
information into three sections: 1) the unmanned aircraft system, 2) the UAS Pilot In
Command (PIC), and 3) the UAS operating parameters.

Unmanned Aircraft System

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a proprietary design, conceived and constructed by
Astraeus Aerial, and referred to as the Astraeus Aerial Cinema System V.3CS UAS aircraft
variant, serial #001 onward (hereafter referred to as V.3). This aircraft has eight rotors and
eight motors in a quadcopter configuration (X8). The petitioner states that given the size,
weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by the
applicant, an exemption from 14 CFR part 21, Subpart H (Airworthiness Certificates), subject
to certain conditions and limitations, is warranted and meets the requirements for an
equivalent level of safety under 14 CFR part 11 and Section 333 of the FAA Modernization
and Reform Act of 2012 (PL 112-95). The petitioner further states that UAS operated without
an airworthiness certificate in the restricted environment and under the conditions and
limitations proposed by the petitioner will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional
aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness certificate issued under 14
CFR part 21, Subpart H and not subject to the proposed conditions and limitations.

The petitioner states that the unmanned aircraft (UA) to be operated under this request is less
than 55 lbs. fully loaded, flies at a speed of no more than 50 knots, carries neither a pilot nor
passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exclusively
within a secured area as set out in the MPTOM. In addition, the petitioner has integrated
safety features into the design of the UAS, as described in the petitioner's FOPM, to ensure
the safety of persons and property within and surrounding the limited operating area. The
petitioner further describes that, in the event the UAS loses communications or its GPS signal,
the UA will have the capability to return to a pre-determined location within the Security
Perimeter and land. It will also have the capability to abort a flight in the event of unpredicted
obstacles or emergencies.

The petitioner states that even though its UAS will have no airworthiness certificate, an
exemption may be needed from 14 CFR § 45.23 as the UA will have no entrance to the cabin,
cockpit, or pilot station on which the word "experimental" can be placed. Given the size of the
UA, the petitioner notes that the two-inch lettering will be impossible. The petitioner asserts
that an equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the UA marked with the word
"experimental" on the fuselage in compliance with 14 CFR § 45.29(f), in a location where the
pilot, observer, and others working with the UA will see the identification.

                                                       47
                                                        7

The petitioner states that the maintenance requirements in the pertinent sections of 14 CFR
part 91 are only applicable to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate in accordance with part
43. The petitioner states that its V.3 UAS does not have specific maintenance instructions;
therefore the petitioner has developed and documented in its MPTOM and FOPM an "on-
condition" maintenance process for the V.3 UAS affected by this exemption. The petitioner
has also stated that it intends to follow any manufacturers' recommended instructions and
procedures when those procedures exist for certain components of its V.3 UAS.

UAS Pilot In Command (PIC)

The petitioner asserts that since the UA will not carry a pilot or passengers on board, the
proposed operations will not adversely affect safety by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft
to have a private pilot's license rather than a commercial pilot's license. In support of its
position, the petitioner argues that, since there are no standards for either private or
commercial UAS pilot certificates, knowledge of airspace regulations and dexterity in the
control and operation of the UAS acquired from actual operation of the aircraft will be the
most important factors in establishing an equivalent level of safety. Furthermore, the
petitioner explains that, given the restricted and controlled airspace within which operations
will take place, the key factors needed by the PIC are knowledge of the airspace within which
the "closed-set filming" operation will take place and how that airspace fits into the National
Airspace System (NAS). The petitioner also states that it cannot be assumed that a
commercial pilot, approved to operate a helicopter or fixed wing aircraft, has the skill or
ability to safely operate an unmanned aerial vehicle, operating at 400 feet AGL or lower,
within strictly controlled pre-approved airspace. The petitioner asserts that there are relatively
few certificated pilots who are also qualified to fly the type of UAS utilized in motion picture
industry image-capture operations. Astraeus further asserts that there are even fewer
commercially certificated pilots that can fly these UAS, to the point that to do both is
considered rare.

Additionally, the petitioner states that the aircraft will be operated within a secure
environment, which no one will be allowed to enter unless they are part of the production,
have been fully briefed of the risks prior to operation of the UAS, and have consented to the
risks associated with being in the operating area. Should there be a mishap, the UA being
flown pose significantly less of a threat than the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft now being
employed because they are a fraction of the size, carry no flammable fuel, and do not carry
crew or passengers. This is in stark contrast to conventional aircraft that are flown to the site,
carry flammable fuel, carry passengers and crew, and operate in a much larger area.

UAS Operating Parameters

The petitioner states that all flights will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of a
pilot and/or observer, and that the UA flights will be limited to a maximum altitude of 400
feet AGL. The petitioner further states that an operator will ensure that only consenting
production personnel will be allowed within 100 feet of the UA operation, but this radius may
be reduced to 30 feet based upon an equivalent level of safety determination, as stated in their
MPTOM, with the advance permission of the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).
The petitioner asserts that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved given the size, weight,

                                                       48
                                                        8

and speed of the UAS, as well as the location where it is operated. The petitioner states that
the UAS will be operated within a safe operating perimeter, the boundaries of which will be
determined by production personnel and the UAS PIC based on the site-specific filming
activities and speed of the UAS required for the operation, and coordinated with the
jurisdictional FAA FSDO and local government officials as applicable, as outlined in the
MPTOM and FOPM. The petitioner states that only participating and consenting production
personnel will be allowed within this perimeter; the petitioner also states their intention to
comply with the guidelines outlined in Order 8900.1 V3, C8, S1 with regard to
nonparticipating personnel outside the safety perimeter. The petitioner argues that, compared
to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than its maximum 55 lb. UA,
and the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated with its UAS operations is far less than
those with conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 feet AGL in the movie industry.

With respect to preflight actions, the petitioner notes it may need an exemption from 14 CFR
§ 91.103, because it will not have approved rotorcraft flight manuals. The petitioner asserts
that an equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the PIC taking all preflight actions as set
forth in their MPTOM and FOPM, including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements,
landing and takeoff distances, and aircraft performance data before initiation of flight.
Additionally, the petitioner states that a briefing will be conducted prior to each day's filming
regarding planned UAS operations, and all personnel who will be performing duties within
the boundaries of the safety perimeter will be required to attend.

With respect to the fuel requirements, the petitioner notes that, in order to meet the 30 minute
reserve requirements in 14 CFR § 91.151, UAS flights would have to be limited to
approximately 10 minutes. The petitioner argues that, given the limitations on the UA's
proposed flight area and the location of its proposed operations within a predetermined area, a
longer time frame for flight in daylight or night VFR conditions is reasonable. The petitioner
believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 30 minutes or
25% of battery power, whichever occurs first.

The petitioner notes that it may need an exemption from 14 CFR § 91.121, as its UAS may
have a GPS altitude read out instead of a barometric altimeter. The petitioner asserts that an
equivalent level of safety will be achieved, as outlined in its MPTOM. Specifically, the
altitude information will be provided to the UAS PIC via a digitally encoded telemetric data
feed. Prior to each flight, a zero altitude initiation point will be established and confirmed for
accuracy by the PIC.

Public Interest

The petitioner states that, given the small size of the UA involved and the restricted sterile
environment within which it will operate, its proposed operation "falls squarely within that
zone of safety (an equivalent level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA
must, by exemption, allow commercial operations of UAS to commence immediately." Also
due to the size of the UA and the restricted areas in which the UAS will operate, approval of
the application presents no national security issue. The petitioner states that, given the clear
direction in Section 333, the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed
operations, and the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in

                                                       49
                                                        9

environmental impacts, and including reduced emissions associated with allowing UAS for
movie and television operations, granting the requested exemptions is in the public interest.

Discussion of Public Comments:

A summary of the petition was published in the Federal Register on June 26, 2014 (79 FR
36378). Eighty-six comments were received.

Of the 86 comments received, including eight from associations, 50 comments supported the
exemption request, 22 opposed, and 14 were neutral. The petition received comments on the
following topics: economic impact, UAS, PIC, operational capabilities, airspace, privacy,
sense and avoid, and data link.

Comments supporting the exemption request came from individuals and industry groups,
including the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), Aerospace
Industries Association (AIA), the National Association of Realtors, the News Media
Coalition, and the National Press Photographers Association. Supporting comments cited the
petitioner's intent to use controlled access airspace, licensed airmen, and preflight safety
briefings, as well as the economic benefits of UAS.

Several trade organizations submitted letters to the docket, expressing various issues and
concerns with the Astraeus petition for exemption, including the Air Line Pilots Association
International (ALPA), the National Agricultural Aviation Association (NAAA), and the
United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (USHPA).

ALPA expressed concern regarding certain conditions outlined in Astraeus' petition. ALPA
notes that the proposed operations will be for "compensation or hire," and ALPA believes that
the pilot must hold at least a current FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate with an appropriate
category and class rating for the type of aircraft being flown as well as specific and adequate
training on the UAS make and model intended to be used. Similarly, a current 2nd Class FAA
Medical certificate should be required for a UAS pilot operating an aircraft for compensation
or hire commercial operations as is required in the NAS today. NAAA and USHPA also
commented on pilot qualification. Specifically,

         NAAA believes that the Part 61 regulations currently in effect do not address the licensing of
         pilots of an unmanned aircraft used for commercial purposes. We believe it is necessary for
         the FAA to evaluate pilots of these aircraft on their knowledge and skills in UAV operations.
         Requirements for this licensing should be developed along with other rigorous rules and
         qualifications to ensure safe integration of the unmanned aircraft into the NAS.

The FAA has carefully reviewed the knowledge and training required by holders of both
private and commercial certificates, as well as the separation of Astraeus' proposed operations
from other manned operations. Additional details are available in the ensuing analysis of this
issue with regards to 14 CFR § 61.113.

ALPA commented that although the anticipated operation is expected to occur below 400 feet
above the surface, the petition also makes reference to operations 200 feet above structures of
unspecified and therefore unlimited height. This would put the aircraft at the same altitude

                                                       50
                                                       10

strata as other aircraft in the NAS, with only geographic separation to mitigate the risk of
collision. However, in subsequent materials posted to the docket, Astraeus has removed
operation from elevated platforms. All operations will be limited to 400 feet AGL, which is
specified in the conditions and limitations below.

ALPA further notes that the aircraft "may not have a barometric altimeter" so the ability to
accurately maintain altitude must be addressed. NAAA noted the same in its comments. The
FAA agrees with ALPA and NAAA and addresses this concern in its analysis of the
exemption from 14 CFR § 91.121, finding that the alternative means of compliance proposed
by Astraeus does not adversely affect safety.

ALPA and an individual comment that Command and Control (C2) link failures are one of the
most common failures on a UAS, and that lost link mitigations should require safe modes to
prevent fly-aways or other scenarios. The FAA agrees and carefully examined the proposed
operation to ensure that the vehicle design and the petitioner's MPTOM and FOPM addressed
potential hazards related to C2 failure. The FAA finds that the UAS to be operated by
Astraeus has sufficient design features to address these hazards. The FAA also finds that the
MPTOM and FOPM have incorporated safety procedures to be followed by all operational
participants should a C2 failure occur. Further detail is contained in the analysis of the UAS
below.

NAAA stated that it represents the interests of small business owners and pilots licensed as
commercial applicators. NAAA members operate in low-level airspace, and clear low-level
airspace is vital to the safety of these operators.

NAAA stated that seeing and avoiding other aircraft and hazardous obstructions is the
backbone for agricultural safety, and agricultural pilots depend on pilots of other aircraft to
perform their see and avoid functions needed to prevent collisions. NAAA believes that UA
operations at low altitudes will increase the potential of collision hazards with agricultural
aircraft. In its comments, the USHPA submitted similar concerns relative to activities of other
low altitude user groups including ballooning, skydiving, powered ultralights, etc.

NAAA acknowledged Astraeus' plan to submit a written Plan of Activities to the FSDO three
days before the proposed operations, as required by the petitioner's MPTOM. However,
NAAA maintains, as does the USHPA, that in addition to this, issuance of a NOTAM
advising nonparticipating pilots of the planned activity is vital to disseminating this safety
information. The FAA agrees and has incorporated this into the conditions and limitations of
this exemption. Further detail is contained in the analysis of the operating parameters below.

NAAA commented that UA should have assigned numbers that can be read from a suitable
distance to aid in identification when enforcement of flight regulations is required. The
USHPA commented similarly, noting that while the current identification standards are not
feasible on small UA given their reduced size, identification appropriate for these design
parameters could be defined and created without undue burden or negative impacts on UAS
operations. The FAA partially agrees with NAAA and USHPA. UA operated under this
exemption will be marked in accordance with 14 CFR part 45 or as otherwise authorized by
the FAA. Further detail is contained in the analysis of the UAS below.

                                                       51
                                                       11

USHPA states that it is a nonprofit member organization with the specific and primary
purpose to engage exclusively for scientific and educational purposes in the development,
study, and use of fuel-less flight systems and aircraft capable of being launched by human
power alone. USHPA commented that it believes with proper notification of time and place,
along with other considerations, safety can be maintained. USHPA's notification concerns
will be addressed by the conditions and limitations that will require an Air Traffic
Organization issued Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) to address airspace
requirements and notification. Further detail is contained in the analysis of the UAS operating
parameters below.

Related to the operation of the UA within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot and/or
observer, USHPA believes operation of any UA in three-dimensional space presents unique
challenges in accurately determining position in relation to stationary or mobile objects.
USHPA comments that utilization of an observer for operational redundancy is prudent and
encouraged, but should not be considered a viable replacement for the pilot in command.
USHPA believes that the identification of navigational requirements and accurately conveying
them to the pilot in command would not be provided with adequate precision or sufficient
response time in a crisis situation and recommends that dual control systems be utilized as a
redundant safety measure common in commercial aviation environments. The FAA notes
USHPA's concerns; additional detail is provided in the analysis of the UAS below.

USHPA also asserts that manned flight should always maintain right of way over all UA
operations. The FAA agrees and has incorporated this into the conditions and limitations of
this exemption.

Several comments noted that small UAS can be hard to see during the day, due to their small
size and factors such as sun glare. Commenters also noted concerns with regard to weather
and wind conditions affecting operations. The FAA addressed these concerns by adding
operating restrictions in the conditions and limitations regarding stand-off distance from
clouds, altitude restrictions, and operating distance from non-participating personnel. Further
detail is contained in the analysis of the UAS operating parameters below.

The petition received several comments suggesting that UAS operated under this exemption
should have the ability to monitor and communicate with other aircraft or install transponders,
or that the UAS should not operate until they can sense and avoid other aircraft. One
commenter suggested that the FAA should implement a buffer between these UAS operations
and manned operations, while another raised concern with near misses with other aircraft.
Two comments noted that UAS are susceptible to accidents and GPS jamming. The FAA
believes the limitations under which the petitioner will operate (i.e. VLOS and at or below
400 feet AGL) and the UAS emergency procedures as outlined in the petitioner's FOPM and
MPTOM are sufficient mitigations to this risk so that the operations will not adversely affect
safety. Further information is contained in the analysis of the UAS below.

One commenter suggested that the FAA should require testing of software and systems prior
to operation, including testing to RTCA standards. The FAA believes the preflight checks
discussed in the analysis of the UAS operating parameters are sufficient to mitigate this risk,
and addresses this in the conditions and limitations below.

                                                       52
                                                       12

The FAA also received comments not related to the UA and its operation as proposed by the
petitioner, but rather addressing more general UAS issues, which are discussed below.

The FAA received two comments asking how the FAA plans to monitor or conduct
surveillance of the petitioner's UAS operations. The FAA expects operators to comply with
its regulations and the terms of the exemption. The jurisdictional FSDO will be the primary
office responsible for oversight of the operations.

The FAA received several comments that integrating UAS operations via a broadly applicable
rule was a more suitable method than the exemption process, and that industries other than the
motion picture industry should be allowed to participate. Section 333 provides interim
authority to the Secretary of Transportation, which facilitates limited, controlled UAS
operations prior to the completion of a UAS regulatory structure. The FAA is using its
exemption process to facilitate implementation of Section 333 and to address FAA rules that
would be applicable to the proposed operations. We have received and are considering
exemption petitions from a broad array of industries and applications for this technology.
Additionally, the FAA is engaged in a rulemaking process that will allow broader applications
of UAS operations.

Two commenters suggested this exemption process should be available to anybody, regardless
of organizational size or resources. The FAA will consider any request for exemption
submitted to it, no matter the source.

One commenter stated that meaningful public review of the petition was not possible because
some of the documents submitted by the petitioner are confidential. The FAA routinely
considers confidential materials in its exemption process. The FAA reviewed and considered
the petitioner's information in its analysis of the petition.

The petition received several comments on privacy. A commenter expressed concern that the
UAS could be used for spying. Other commenters stated that there are strong privacy
regulations in place. Specifically, a commenter states that the petitioner addressed privacy
issues in its request by mandating that all filming be within a contained environment with all
participants fully aware that they are being filmed. The petitioner states that all UAS flights
will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's prior consent
and knowledge, and that only people who have consented or otherwise have agreed to be in
the area where filming will take place will be filmed. The FAA notes that the terms of this
grant of exemption are consistent with the petitioner's proposal in this area.

The FAA's analysis is as follows:

Unmanned aircraft system (UAS)

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR part 21 Certification procedures for
products and parts, the FAA finds that, based on the limited size, weight, operating
conditions, design safety features, and the imposed conditions and limitations, the petitioner
has demonstrated that its operations would not adversely affect safety compared to similar

                                                       53
                                                       13

operations conducted with aircraft that have been issued an airworthiness certificate under
14 CFR part 21, Subpart H.

Commercial motion picture and television aerial filming operations with manned aircraft are
typically conducted with aircraft holding standard airworthiness certificates issued under
part 21, subpart H. These aircraft are normally modified via the Supplemental Type Certificate
(STC) process to install cameras and other equipment not included in the original aircraft
design.

Manned helicopters conducting motion picture and television aerial filming can weigh 6,000
lbs. or more and are operated by an onboard pilot, in addition to other onboard crewmembers,
as necessary. The petitioner's UA will weigh less than 55 lbs. with no onboard pilot or crew.
The pilot and crew will be remotely located from the aircraft. The limited weight significantly
reduces the potential for harm to participating and nonparticipating individuals or property in
the event of an incident or accident. The risk to an onboard pilot and crew during an incident
or accident is eliminated with the use of a UA for the aerial filming operation.

Manned aircraft are at risk of fuel spillage and fire in the event of an incident or accident. The
UA carries no fuel, and therefore the risk of fire following an incident or accident due to fuel
spillage is eliminated.

During motion picture and television aerial filming with manned aircraft under the conditions
of an FAA issued Certificate of Waiver, aircraft can be operated in very close proximity to
participating persons. The safety of these individuals is maintained through use of an aircraft
with standard airworthiness certification under 14 CFR part 21, Subpart H, operation of the
aircraft by a qualified and competent pilot, and operating according to limitations necessary to
ensure safety. In these situations, the filming subject and production personnel are exposed to
risk by virtue of their close proximity to an aircraft in flight. Compared to manned aircraft, the
UA being operated by the petitioner reduces the risk to participating persons in close
proximity to the aircraft due to the limited size, weight, operating conditions, and design
safety features of the UAS.

This exemption does not require an electronic means to monitor and communicate with other
aircraft, such as transponders or sense and avoid technology. Rather the FAA is mitigating the
risk of these operations by placing limits on altitude, requiring stand-off distance from clouds,
permitting daytime operations only, and requiring that the UA be operated within visual line
of sight and yield right of way to all other manned operations. Additionally, the exemption
provides that the operator will request a NOTAM prior to operations to alert other users of the
NAS.

The petitioner's UAS has the capability to operate safely after experiencing certain in-flight
failures. The UA is also able to respond to a lost-link event with a pre-coordinated,
predictable, automated flight maneuver. With regard to USHPA's concerns about dual control
systems, current FAA regulations permit motion picture and television filming operations by
manned aircraft that do not require a copilot. Additionally, under this exemption, the FAA
requires that the UAS PIC hold a current third class medical certificate. Historically, instances
of complete PIC incapacitation are rare. In all other cases other than complete incapacitation,

                                                       54
                                                       14

the PIC has the ability to terminate the flight operation or initiate the automated return to
home procedure outlined within the FOPM. The FAA also believes that the multiple control
redundancies described in the petitioner's FOPM are sufficient to mitigate risks associated
with the loss of GPS signal. In consideration of these factors and the UA size, weight, speed
and other operating limitations associated with this aerial filmmaking operation, the FAA
finds that there is no adverse safety affect relative to similar operations conducted by manned
aircraft with a flight crew complement of one.

These safety features also provide for no adverse safety affect to participating and
nonparticipating individuals compared to a manned aircraft that holds a standard airworthiness
certificate performing a similar operation.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of PL 112-95 in reference to
49 USC 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area
associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined
that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the
requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 45.23(b) Display of marks, the
petitioner's request is made under the assumption that marking with the word "experimental"
will be required as a condition of an exemption request. This marking is reserved for aircraft
that are issued experimental certificates under § 21.191. Since the petitioner's UAS will not
be certificated under 14 CFR § 21.191, a grant of exemption for 14 CFR § 45.23(b) is not
necessary.

The petitioner's UA must be identified by serial number, registered in accordance with 14
CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part
45, Subpart C. Markings must be as large as practicable.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR §§ 91.405(a) Maintenance
required, 91.407(a)(1) Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or
alteration, 91.409(a)(2) Inspections, and 91.417(a) and (b) Maintenance records, the FAA has
determined that relief from 91.409(a)(1) is also necessary, because it is an alternate inspection
requirement of 91.409(a)(2).

The petitioner's FOPM contains the maintenance requirements for the V.3 UAS, to include
"on-condition" maintenance and modifications. The petitioner's MPTOM and FOPM were
reviewed and do not sufficiently support the regulatory relief sought under 14 CFR part 91,
Subpart E. The FAA has carefully considered the petitioner's supplemental information and
determined that its operations will not adversely affect safety with regard to the regulatory
maintenance and alteration requirements of 14 CFR §§ 91.405(a)(1), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), provided changes are made to the MPTOM and
FOPM as required by the conditions and limitations included in this exemption. These
changes include: requirements to develop and document maintenance, overhaul, replacement,
and inspection requirements in the absence of manufacturer's requirements; procedures to
document and maintain maintenance records with regard to the petitioner's UAS; and UAS

                                                       55
                                                       15

technician qualification criteria. They also require the petitioner's FOPM to include preflight
inspection procedures that account for any discrepancies not already covered in the manual.
The FAA finds these additional requirements are necessary to ensure the petitioner's proposed
UAS operations do not adversely affect safety in the NAS and of people and property on the
ground. Therefore, the FAA finds that exemption from 14 CFR §§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) is warranted subject to the conditions and
limitations below.

Pilot In Command of the UAS

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 61.113(a) and (b) Private pilot
privileges and limitations, comments were received that voiced concerns about pilot
certification. One such comment came from ALPA, which states that one of the "areas that
must be addressed to ensure safe operations" is Astraeus' proposal to use a private pilot with a
third class medical as its UAS PIC. ALPA believes that the UAS pilot should possess a
commercial pilot certificate with appropriate category and class rating for the type of aircraft
being flown and the corresponding second class medical certificate, as well as specific and
adequate training on the UAS make and model intended to be used. Similar concerns were
also raised by other associations such as USHPA and NAAA.

Given these grounds, the FAA must determine the appropriate level of pilot certification for
Astraeus' proposed operation. Title 14 CFR part 61 requires that operations conducted for
compensation or hire necessitate a commercial pilot certificate and at least a second class
medical certificate. In considering the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 61.113(a)
and (b), the FAA must consider the following factors as they relate specifically to Astraeus'
proposed operations:

Separation from manned aircraft operations: Astraeus proposes operations in a "sterile
environment" of closed-set motion-picture filming. In this controlled environment, their
operations will remain within visual line of site (VLOS) and below 400 feet AGL.
Additionally, the FAA has added further conditions and limitations that will require a
Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) from the FAA Air Traffic Organization to
address airspace requirements and notification requiring Astraeus to request a Notice to
Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in advance, but not less than 48 hours prior to the
operation. Astraeus will also be required to avoid and yield right-of-way to all manned
operations.

The current aeronautical knowledge requirements for a private pilot compared to a
commercial pilot: The FAA analyzed the areas of knowledge specified in 14 CFR part 61 for
that of a commercial pilot versus a private pilot. The results show that the required areas of

The specific UAS airmanship skills required for Astraeus' PIC(s): Some of the
requirements for Astraeus' PIC(s) are provided in their proprietary documents. However, as
with other exemptions that contain specific pilot qualifications, e.g. Exemption Nos. 7830,
6802K, and 6540N, those pilot requirements become conditions and limitations within the
grant of exemption. An abbreviated summary of those PIC requirements include the
following:

             a. The PIC must possess a Private Pilot's Certificate and a valid third-class
                  medical certificate;

             b. The PIC must have accumulated and logged a minimum of 200 flight cycles
                  and 25 hours of total time as a UAS rotorcraft pilot and at least 10 hours
                  logged as a UAS pilot with a similar UAS type (single blade or multirotor).

             c. The PIC must have accumulated and logged a minimum of five hours as UAS
                  pilot with the make and model of UAS to be utilized for operations under the
                  exemption and three take-offs and landings in the preceding 90 days.

             d. The PIC must have successfully completed the qualification process as
                  specified in the MPTOM and FOPM, to include a knowledge and skill test.

The FAA's analysis regarding PIC requirements: The parallel foundation of aeronautical
knowledge required for private and commercial pilots is shown in the above table. Private

                                                      58
                                                       18

pilot airmanship skills are furthered through manned flights in the NAS. Commercially
certificated pilots build additional experience through these manned flights as well. The
additional experience and airmanship skills obtained by commercially certificated airmen
contribute to their ability to overcome adverse situations that could be encountered in flights
conducted for compensation or hire. However, the experience obtained beyond a private pilot
certificate in pursuit of a commercial pilot certificate in manned flight does not necessarily aid
a pilot in the operational environment proposed by the petitioner; the FAA considers the
overriding safety factor for the limited operations proposed by the petitioner to be the
airmanship skills acquired through UAS-specific flight cycles, flight time, and specific make
and model experience, culminating in verification through testing.

The FAA shares ALPA's concerns regarding appropriate training on the UAS being utilized.
The FAA has reviewed the petitioner's knowledge and experience criteria for its PICs. The
FAA finds that the combination of aeronautical knowledge, UAS airmanship skills, and
verification through testing is a sufficient method for Astraeus to evaluate a pilot's
qualifications, given that operations will be conducted within the limitations outlined in this
exemption.

The knowledge and airmanship test qualifications have been developed by Astraeus for the
UAS operations proposed in their petition for exemption. There are no established practical
test standards that support a jurisdictional FAA FSDO evaluation and approval of company
designated examiners. The petitioner will conduct these tests in accordance with its FOPM
and the conditions and limitations noted below. Given the constraints of the proposed
operations, the FAA believes this would not adversely affect the safety of the NAS.

The petitioner plans to operate in a unique and limited environment. Given the 1) separation
of these closed-set filming operations from other manned operations, 2) the parallel nature of
private pilot aeronautical knowledge requirements to those of commercial requirements, and
3) the UAS airmanship skills of Astraeus' PICs, the FAA finds that the additional manned
airmanship experience of a commercially certificated pilot would not correlate to the
airmanship skills necessary for Astraeus' specific proposed operations. Upon consideration of
the overall safety case presented by the petitioner and the concerns of the commenters, the
FAA finds that granting the requested relief from 14 CFR § 61.113(a) and (b), provided the
conditions and limitations outlined below, would not adversely affect the safety of the NAS.

Another consideration supporting the certificate requirement is that pilots holding a private
pilot certificate are subject to security screening by the Department of Homeland Security.
This requirement should ameliorate security concerns over UAS operations under this
exemption.

Operating parameters of the UAS

Astraeus has stated that it plans to comply with the waiver process as described in FAA Order
8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 8, Section 1 (V3, C8, S1) Issue a Certificate of Waiver for Motion
Picture and Television Filming. The FAA agrees with this philosophy; however, the current
section of Order 8900.1 has specific processes that preclude a jurisdictional FAA FSDO from
issuing the required Certificate of Waiver, because the section did not originally provide for

                                                       59
                                                       19

UA operations. One example of this is the minimum pilot qualifications ­ the pertinent
section of Order 8900.1 provides no way to relieve Astraeus from the pilot requirements.
Also, the sample form 7711-1 used for issuing the Certificate of Waiver specifically states
"this section not used for Unmanned Air Vehicle authorizations."

Therefore, the FAA will exempt Astraeus from the applicable regulations normally waived
during that process. The FAA will then include the required notifications and coordination
with jurisdictional FSDOs through the conditions and limitations listed below. Motion picture
and television filming waivers similar to Astraeus' operation are normally issued from one
jurisdictional FSDO and can be used in locations covered by other geographically responsible
FSDOs through notification. Those local FSDOs then have the ability to review the proposed
plan of activities and associated operations manual(s) and levy any additional local special
provisions. Since Astraeus' operation deals specifically with UAS, this exemption will take
the place of the Certificate of Waiver normally issued by a jurisdictional FSDO under 8900.1
V3, C8, S1. Every FSDO with jurisdiction over the area that Astraeus plans to operate within
must still be notified, just as with manned filming operations, and those FSDOs will have the
ability to coordinate further conditions and limitations with the UAS Integration Office to
address any local concerns, as stated below in the conditions and limitations section of this
exemption.

The petitioner must also obtain a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) from the
FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) prior to conducting any operations. This is an existing
process that not only makes local Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities aware of UAS
operations, but also provides ATO the ability to consider airspace issues that are unique to
UAS operations. The COA will require the operator to request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM),
which is the mechanism for alerting other users of the NAS to the UAS activities being
conducted. Therefore, the FAA believes that adherence to this process is the safest and most
expeditious way to permit Astraeus to conduct their proposed UAS operations. The conditions
and limitations below prescribe the requirement for Astraeus to obtain an ATO-issued COA.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.7(a) Civil Aircraft
Airworthiness, Astraeus' request is based on the fact that no airworthiness certificate will be
issued for the UAS. As previously noted, the petitioner's UAS will not require an
airworthiness certificate in accordance with 14 CFR part 21, Subpart H. Based on the fact that
an airworthiness certificate will not be issued, exemption from § 91.7(a) is not necessary.

In accordance with the pertinent part of 14 CFR § 91.7(b), the PIC of the UAS is responsible
for determining whether the aircraft is in condition for safe flight. The petitioner's manuals for
maintenance and operations include safety checklists to be used prior to each flight.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.9(b)(2) Civil aircraft flight
manual, marking, and placard requirements and § 91.203(a) and (b) Civil aircraft:
Certifications required, the original intent of these regulations was to display an aircraft's
airworthiness, certification, and registration documents so they would be easily available to
inspectors and passengers. Based on the FAA Memorandum subject "Interpretation regarding
whether certain required documents may be kept at an unmanned aircraft's control station,"

                                                       60
                                                       20

dated August 8, 2014, the requested relief from 14 CFR §§ 91.9(b)(2) and 91.203(a) and (b) is
not necessary.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.103 Preflight action, although
there will be no approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual as specified in paragraph
(b)(1), the FAA believes that the petitioner can comply with the other applicable requirements
in 14 CFR § 91.103(b)(2). The procedures outlined in the petitioner's MPTOM and FOPM
address the FAA's concerns regarding compliance with § 91.103(b). The petitioner has also
stated its intent to comply with § 91.103(a): "The PIC will take all actions including reviewing
weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff distances and aircraft performance
data before initiation of flight." The FAA has imposed stricter requirements with regard to
visibility and distance from clouds; this is to both keep the UA from departing VLOS and to
preclude the UA from operating so close to a cloud as to create a hazard to other aircraft
operating in the NAS. The FAA also notes the risks associated with sun glare; the FAA
believes that the PIC's and VO's ability to still see other air traffic, combined with the PIC's
ability to initiate a return-to-home sequence, are sufficient mitigations in this respect. The PIC
will also account for all relevant site-specific conditions in their preflight procedures.
Therefore, the FAA finds that exemption from 14 CFR § 91.103 is not necessary.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.109 Flight instruction;
Simulated instrument flight and certain flight tests, the petitioner did not describe training
scenarios in which a dual set of controls would be utilized or required, i.e. dual flight
instruction, provided by a flight instructor or other company-designated individual, that would
require that individual to have fully functioning dual controls. Rather, Astraeus evaluates the
qualification of its PICs based on their experience with the UAS to be operated and verifies
through testing, in lieu of formalized training. As such, the FAA finds that the petitioner can
conduct its operations without the requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.109.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.119 Minimum safe altitudes, the
petitioner failed to specify the pertinent part of 14 CFR § 91.119 from which they require
relief. Relief from 14 CFR § 91.119(a) , which requires operating at an altitude that allows a
safe emergency landing if a power unit fails, is unprecedented and unwarranted. Relief from §
14 CFR 91.119(b), operation over congested areas, is not applicable, because the petitioner
states that operations will only be conducted within the sterile area described in the MPTOM.

Although the petitioner specifically mentioned relief from 14 CFR § 91.119(d), the FAA finds
that relief is only needed from 14 CFR § 91.119(c), which is consistent with the relief
typically provided to manned operations in FAA Order 8900.1 V3, C8, S1 Issue a Certificate
of Waiver for Motion Picture and Television Filming. This Order allows for relief from §
91.119(c) with respect to those participating persons, vehicles, and structures directly involved
in the performance of the actual filming. In accordance with the petitioner's stated intention to
adhere to Order 8900.1 V3, C8, S1, persons other than participating persons1 are not allowed

1 Per Order 8900.1 V3, C8, S1, participating persons are all persons associated with the filming production, and
they must be briefed on the potential risk of the proposed flight operation(s) and must acknowledge and accept
those risks. Nonparticipating persons are the public, spectators, media, etc., not associated with the filming
production.

                                                       61
                                                       21

within 500 feet of the operating area. This provision may be reduced to no less than 200 feet if
an equivalent level of safety can be achieved and the Administrator has approved it. For
example, an equivalent level of safety may be determined through evaluation by an aviation
safety inspector of the filming production area to note terrain features, obstructions, buildings,
etc. Such barriers may protect nonparticipating persons (observers, the public, news media,
etc.) from debris in the event of an accident.

The FAA notes the petitioner's additional guidelines in its MPTOM to protect its participating
production personnel, and finds that relief from 14 CFR § 91.119(c) is warranted, provided
adherence to the procedures outlined in the petitioner's MPTOM and FOPM, and the FAA's
additional conditions and limitations outlined below. However, all nonparticipating personnel
will be required to be at least 500 feet from flight operations, with possible relief to allow
reductions to 200 feet, as specified above.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.121 Altimeter Settings, the FAA
believes that an altitude reading is a critical safety component of the petitioner's proposed
operation. Although the petitioner will not have a typical barometric altimeter onboard the
aircraft, the FAA finds the petitioner's intention to operate the UA within VLOS and at or
below 400 feet AGL, combined with the petitioner's intention to provide altitude information
to the UAS pilot via a digitally encoded telemetric data feed, which downlinks from the
aircraft to a ground-based on-screen display, to be a sufficient method for ensuring the UAS
operations do not adversely affect safety. The altitude information will be generated by
equipment installed onboard the aircraft, as specified using GPS triangulation, or digitally
encoded barometric altimeter, or radio altimeter, or any combination thereof. Prior to each
flight, a zero altitude initiation point will be established and confirmed for accuracy by the
UAS PIC. The FAA has determined that good cause exists for granting the requested relief to
14 CFR § 91.121.

Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 91.151(a) Fuel requirements for
flight in VFR conditions, relief has been granted for manned aircraft to operate at less than the
minimums prescribed in 14 CFR § 91.151(a), including Exemption Nos. 2689, 5745, and
10650. In addition, similar UAS-specific relief has been granted in Exemption Nos. 8811,
10808, and 10673 for daytime, Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions. The petitioner states
that its UAS operations will be conducted in a controlled closed-set filming environment, with
UA under 55 pounds, at speeds below 50 Knots, and within VLOS. These factors, combined
with Astraeus' stated intention to terminate flights after 30 minutes or with 25% remaining
battery power (whichever occurs first), provides the FAA sufficient reason to grant the relief
from 14 CFR § 91.151(a) as requested in accordance with the conditions and limitations
proposed by Astraeus.

With respect to the petitioner's request to operate at night, the FAA finds that the petitioner
has not provided a sufficient safety case and mitigations, per FAA Order 8900.1 V16, C5, S3
General Operational Requirements, to avoid collision hazards at night. All previous UAS-
specific grants of relief from 14 CFR § 91.151(a) have restricted flights to daytime VFR
conditions only. While the FAA acknowledges the petitioner's stated film set lighting
techniques to mitigate the risks of nighttime operations, the petitioner has not provided

                                                       62
                                      22

sufficient data and analysis regarding the PICs' and VOs' ability to maintain VLOS with the
UA and conduct their functions to see and avoid other potential obstacles and air traffic,
relative to the lighting configuration on the film set. There is a limitation outlined below that
precludes nighttime UAS operations. The petitioner may provide additional data and seek an
amendment to its exemption to permit night operations.

Additionally, in evaluating the petitioner's proposed operating parameters with regard to
VLOS and a safe operating perimeter, the FAA considered operations from a moving device
or vehicle. Since the petitioner did not discuss provisions for these circumstances, the
conditions and limitations below preclude operations from moving devices or vehicles.

Public Interest

The FAA finds that a grant of exemption is in the public interest. The enhanced safety
achieved using a UA with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no
passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying
crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation
enabled by this exemption is in the public interest. The FAA also finds that UAS provide an
additional tool for the filmmaking industry, adding a greater degree of flexibility, which
supplements the current capabilities offered by manned aircraft.

The table below summarizes the FAA's determinations regarding the relief sought by the
petitioner:

The FAA's Decision
In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. §§ 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Astraeus Aerial is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.113(a) and (b); 91.119(c); 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1);
91.409(a)(1) and (2); and 91.417(a) and (b) to the extent necessary to allow Astraeus to
operate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for the purpose of scripted, closed-set filming for
the motion picture and television industry. This exemption is subject to the conditions and
limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

Relative to this grant of exemption, Astraeus is hereafter referred to as the operator.

The Flight Operations and Procedures Manual (FOPM) and Motion Picture and Television
Operations Manual (MPTOM) are hereafter collectively referred to as the operator's manual.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

The operator proposed the following conditions and/or limitations, which were accepted by
the FAA.2

1. The unmanned aircraft (UA) must weigh less than 55 pounds (25 Kg), including energy
    source(s) and equipment. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to
    the following aircraft described in the operator's manual: Astraeus Aerial Cinema System
    V.3CS UAS aircraft variant, serial #001 onward (V.3). Proposed operations of any other
    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this grant.

2. The UA may not be flown at a ground speed exceeding 50 knots.

3. Flights must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL), as indicated by the procedures specified in the operator's manual. All altitudes
    reported to ATC must be in feet AGL.

2 Conditions and limitations outlined by the operator may have been modified for clarity.

                                                       24

4. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times. This
    requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued medical certificate.

5. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The VO may be used to satisfy the
    VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability. The VO and
    PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times.

6. The operator's manual is considered acceptable to the FAA, provided the additional
    requirements identified in these conditions and limitations are added or amended. The
    operator's manual and this grant of exemption must be maintained and made available to
    the Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operator's manual, the
    conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed. Otherwise, the
    operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operator's manual.

    The operator may update or revise its operator's manual. It is the operator's responsibility
    to track such revisions and present updated and revised documents to the Administrator
    upon request. The operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions
    for extension or amendment. If the operator determines that any update or revision would
    affect the basis for which the FAA granted this exemption, then the operator must petition
    for amendment to their exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be
    contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the operator's manual.

7. Prior to each flight the PIC must inspect the UAS to ensure it is in a condition for safe
    flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the
    aircraft is prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed
    and the UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight. The Ground Control Station, if
    utilized, must be included in the preflight inspection. All maintenance and alterations must
    be properly documented in the aircraft records.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or
    flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo a
    functional test flight in accordance with the operator's manual. The PIC who conducts the
    functional test flight must make an entry in the UAS aircraft records of the flight. The
    requirements and procedures for a functional test flight and aircraft record entry must be
    added to the operator's manual.

9. The operator must follow the manufacturer's UAS aircraft/component, maintenance,
    overhaul, replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements. When unavailable, aircraft
    maintenance/component/overhaul, replacement, and inspection/maintenance requirements
    must be established and identified in the operator's manual. At a minimum, requirements
    for the following must be included in the operator's manual:

                                                       65
                                          25

a. Actuators / Servos;

b. Transmission (single rotor);

c. Powerplant (motors);

d. Propellers;

e. Electronic speed controller;

f. Batteries;

g. Mechanical dynamic components (single rotor);

h. Remote command and control;

i. Ground control station (if used); and

j. Any other components as determined by the operator;

10. The Pilot In Command (PIC) must possess at least a private pilot certificate and at least a
    current third-class medical certificate. The PIC must also meet the flight review
    requirements specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or
    her pilot certificate.

11. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of motion picture filming (or similar
    operations), the PIC must have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b), a minimum of 200 flight cycles and 25 hours of total time as a UAS
    rotorcraft pilot and at least ten hours logged as a UAS pilot with a similar UAS type
    (single blade or multirotor). Prior documented flight experience that was obtained in
    compliance with applicable regulations may satisfy this requirement. Training,
    proficiency, and experience-building flights can also be conducted under this grant of
    exemption to accomplish the required flight cycles and flight time. During training,
    proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for flight operations
    are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA with appropriate distance
    from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

12. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of motion picture filming (or similar
    operations), the PIC must have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b), a minimum of five hours as UAS pilot operating the make and model
    of UAS to be utilized for operations under the exemption and three take-offs and three
    landings in the preceding 90 days. Training, proficiency, experience-building, and take-off
    and landing currency flights can be conducted under this grant of exemption to accomplish

                                          66
                                                       26

    the required flight time and 90 day currency. During training, proficiency, experience-
    building, and take-off and landing currency flights all persons not essential for flight
    operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA with
    appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

13. Prior to any flight operations authorized by this grant of exemption, the PIC and VO must
    have successfully completed a qualification process, as outlined in the operator's manual.
    As this is a requirement stipulated by the operator, the test must be developed and
    implemented by a qualified person designated at the sole discretion of the operator. A
    record of completion of this qualification process must be documented and made available
    to the Administrator upon request.

14. Prior to operations conducted for the purpose of motion picture filming (or similar
    operations), a flight demonstration, administered by an operator-approved and -qualified
    pilot must be successfully completed and documented. This documentation must be
    available for review upon request by the Administrator. Because the knowledge and
    airmanship test qualifications have been developed by the operator, and there are no
    established practical test standards that support a jurisdictional FAA FSDO evaluation and
    approval of company designated examiners, the petitioner will conduct these tests in
    accordance with the operator's manual.

15. The UA may not be operated directly over any person, except authorized and consenting
    production personnel, below an altitude that is hazardous to persons or property on the
    surface in the event of a UAS failure or emergency.

16. Regarding the distance from participating persons, the operator's manual has safety
    mitigations for authorized and consenting production personnel. At all times, those
    persons must be essential to the closed-set film operations. Because these procedures are
    specific to participating persons, no further FSDO or aviation safety inspector approval is
    necessary for reductions to the distances specified in the petitioner's manuals. This is
    consistent with the manned aircraft procedures described in FAA Order 8900.1, V3, C8,
    S1 Issue a Certificate of Waiver for Motion Picture and Television Filming.

17. Regarding distance from nonparticipating persons, the operator must ensure that no
    persons are allowed within 500 feet of the area except those consenting to be involved and
    necessary for the filming production. This provision may be reduced to no less than
    200 feet if it would not adversely affect safety and the Administrator has approved it. For
    example, an equivalent level of safety may be determined by an aviation safety inspector's
    evaluation of the filming production area to note terrain features, obstructions, buildings,
    safety barriers, etc. Such barriers may protect nonparticipating persons (observers, the
    public, news media, etc.) from debris in the event of an accident. This is also consistent
    with the same FAA Order 8900.1, V3, C8, S1.

                                                       67
                                                       27
18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-

    determined location within the security perimeter and land or be recovered in accordance
    with the operator's manual.

19. The UAS must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies in
    accordance with the operator's manual.

20. Each UAS operation must be completed within 30 minutes flight time or with 25% battery
    power remaining, whichever occurs first.

In addition to the conditions and limitations proposed by the operator, the FAA has
determined that any operations conducted under this grant of exemption must be done
pursuant to the following conditions and limitations:

21. The operator must obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver
    or Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under this grant of exemption.
    This COA will also require the operator to request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not
    more than 72 hours in advance, but not less than 48 hours prior to the operation.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be as
    large as practicable.

23. The operator must develop procedures to document and maintain a record of the UAS
    maintenance, preventative maintenance, alterations, status of replacement/overhaul
    component parts, and the total time in service of the UAS. These procedures must be
    added to the operator's manual.

24. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer Safety
    Bulletins.

25. The operator must develop UAS technician qualification criteria. These criteria must be
    added to the operator's manual.

26. The preflight inspection section in the operator's manual must be amended to include the
    following requirement: The preflight inspection must account for all discrepancies, i.e.
    inoperable components, items, or equipment, not covered in the relevant preflight
    inspection sections of the operator's manual.

27. Before conducting operations, the radio frequency spectrum used for operation and control
    of the UA must comply with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or other
    appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

                                                       68
                                                       28
28. At least three days before scheduled filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this

    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local FSDO with jurisdiction
    over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day notification may be waived with the
    concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities must include at least the following:

    a. Dates and times for all flights;

    b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS filming production conducted
         under this grant of exemption;

    c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of the
         UAS;

    d. Make, model, and serial or N-number of UAS to be used;

    e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the filming production event;

    f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners and/or
         local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those who gave
         permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;

    g. Signature of exemption-holder or representative; and

    h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city, town,
         county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted and the altitudes essential to
         accomplish the operation.

29. The documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the PIC at
    the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
    upon request.

30. The UA must remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned operations and
    activities at all times (including, but not limited to, ultralight vehicles, parachute activities,
    parasailing activities, hang gliders, etc.).

31. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

32. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

33. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet horizontally
    from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

                                                       69
                                           29

34. The UA may not operate in Class B, C, or D airspace without written approval from the
    FAA. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of the geographic center of a non-
    towered airport as denoted on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter of
    agreement with that airport's management is obtained, and the operation is conducted in
    accordance with a NOTAM as required by the operator's COA. The letter of agreement
    with the airport management must be made available to the Administrator upon request.

35. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported to
    the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be reported
    to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the
    NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov. Further flight operations may not be conducted until the
    incident, accident, or transgression is reviewed by AFS-80 and authorization to resume
    operations is provided.

Unless otherwise specified in this grant of exemption, the UAS, the UAS PIC, and the UAS
operations must comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts
45, 47, 61, and 91.

This exemption terminates on September 30, 2016, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

SILT, Colo.  Authorities say a helicopter conducting a power line inspection tour near Silt in
western Colorado hit power lines and crashed on Monday, killing all three people on board.

The Garfield County Sheriff's Office said the crash occurred at around 11:20 a.m. near Dry
Hallow Road  about 2 miles off Interstate 70.

The helicopter crashed when it struck power lines while performing survey work for a power
company, said  Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman  for the Federal Aviation Administration.

Sheriff's Office spokesman Walt Stowe said witnesses saw the crash and drove to the scene to
help, but all three occupants were dead. Stowe said the crash debris was in a tight area, no
more than 50feet wide.

"The terrain is kind of hilly, ravines and draws" covered by sage brush, Stowe said.

A deputy is guarding the crash site until National Transportation Safety Board and FAA
officials arrive.

Kenitzer says a preliminary report will likely be completed by the NTSB in the next week or
two.

7NEWS has learned that the chopper was registered to DBS Helicopters
(http://www.dbshelicopters.com/) in Rifle, Colo.

According to the company's website, it operates the Bell LongRanger L3 helicopter.

Two people died when a helicopter crashed yesterday during a flight to inspect power lines in rural western
Alabama, authorities said.

The helicopter was being used to monitor highvoltage power lines in a remote area about 30 miles west of
Birmingham when it crashed, killing both the pilot and a worker for Alabama Power Co., authorities said.

The helicopter, a McDonnell Douglas 369E, was owned by RotorWorks, a Georgiabased contracting firm
that also employed the pilot, he said.

A Turlock man working as a line inspector in Texas died Monday when the
helicopter cable he was tethered to snapped.

David Edward Oliveira, 26, of Turlock and Christopher Geoffrey Breed, 27, of
Moscow, Idaho, were killed in the accident in Martin County, Texas.

Both men were attached to a cable that was suspended from a helicopter that was
flying over a rural section of Texas to do line inspections. The men fell more than
100 feet to their death when the cable struck a power line, according to the Martin
County Sheriff's Office.

Oliveira and Breed were employed with Haverfield Aviation, based in Pennsylvania.
The two men were conducting an aerial inspection of power lines that transfer
windmill energy for Wind Energy Transmission Texas.

The helicopter pilot was able to land nearby and was taken to an area hospital with
an unspecified injury.

The accident is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration, the
National Transportation Safety Board and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.

Abstract

Electrical power companies usually perform regular visual inspection to check the status of their transmission lines mainly using

helicopter equipped with external gimbals housing infrared and ultraviolet camera to detect hot spots and corona discharges. This

solution is quite expensive, dangerous for the crew and not very reliable. Focus of this paper is, presenting the state of the art of the

most important current projects concerning the two main categories of robots offering a solution of automation, vertical take-off

and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and rolling on wires robots (RWR), to create a simple roadmap that can

guide researchers and industries in the implementation of a                                      LIVE LINE POWER LINE INSPECTION

          : a rigorous live line inspection strategy based on a completely autonomous mobile platform capable of a meaningful

payload and a power line data management system including specific tool for image and signal data processing to automatically

detect defects or abnormal conditions.

Montana city gets OK to drink water after oil
spill in river

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- Thousands of people in a Montana city can resume drinking from their taps after a
federal official said there are no further signs of contamination from a weekend crude oil spill into a nearby
river.
Paul Peronard with the Environmental Protection Agency said test results received Thursday no longer show
elevated levels of cancercausing benzene in the municipal water supply of Glendive.
Officials had detected the benzene levels after 40,000 gallons of oil spilled on Saturday from a pipeline break
beneath the Yellowstone River upstream from the city.

                                                                     85                                                 1/9

                               Workers recovered about 10,000 gallons of oil from a ruptured pipeline that spilled crude
                                   into Yellowstone River and contaminated the drinking water supply of the eastern

                                  Montana city downstream. An estimated 40,000 gallons is still in the river and will be
                                difficult to remove because of a thick layer of ice. (AP Photo/The Billings Gazette, Larry

Peronard says residents should run the water from their taps to flush any residual contamination.
Officials are struggling to clean the crude, most of which is believed trapped beneath ice on the river.

North Dakota: Pipeline Rupture Spills 3 Million
Gallons of Saltwater

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS JAN. 22, 2015

        Earthen barriers have been set up across a creek and water was being tested
        Thursday around the site of a nearly threemilliongallon leak of saltwater
        generated by oil drilling, the largest spill of its kind in North Dakota's current
        oil rush. The berms were built at Blacktail Creek to prevent potentially
        contaminated water from flowing out of the creek and into a bigger body of
        water that leads into the Missouri River. The pipeline operator, Summit
        Midstream Partners, and state inspectors will keep testing the soil and water
        at Blacktail Creek and the larger Little Muddy Creek. The saltwater produced
        by oil and natural gas production is much saltier than seawater and may also
        contain petroleum and residue from hydraulic fracturing. The spill was
        detected Jan. 6 during a periodic inspection by the company, which said
        Thursday that the cause of the rupture in the pipeline and when exactly it
        happened were still unknown.

          the headline: North Dakota: Pipeline Rupture Spills 3 Million Gallons of Saltwater.

Memorandum

Date:     AUG -$ 2014
To:
From:     ~~John Duncan, Director, Flight Standards Service, AFS-1
          t:kwtia .Mark W. Bury, Assistant Chief Counsel for Intemationa:1
                                                                            and

          Regulations, AGC-200

Prepared by: Dean E. Griffith, Attorney, AGC-220

Subject:  Interpretation regarding whether certain required documents may be kept at an
          unmanned aircraft's control station.

This memorandum addresses whether the pilot of an unmanned aircraft may keep airworthiness
certificates, aircraft manuals, and aircraft registration certificates at the unmanned aircraft's
ground control station and satisfy the regulatory requirements of sections 91. 9(b), 91.203 (a) and
(b), 47.3(b)(2), and 47.3l(c) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. This question has been
brought to our attention because of the impracticality of placing these documents on a small
aircraft with no pilot on board. As discussed below, we find that the intent of these regulations is
met if the pilot of the unmanned aircraft has access to these documents at the control station from
which he or she is operating the aircraft.

Section 91.9(b) prohibits operation ofU.S.-registered civil aircraft unless "there is available in
the aircraft" an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual or other material, markings and placards.
The FAA stated that the purpose of this rule is to "insure that the information is readily available
to the pilot" for use during operations. See 40 Fed. Reg. 24665 (June 9, 1975), 37 Fed. Reg.
20022 (Sept. 23, 1972). The text of the rule and preamble to subsequent revisions of the rule
confirm the intent that the pilot is to have access to the material during flight. Accordingly, we
find that the intent of the rule is met if the information is maintained at the pilot's control station
such that it is available to the pilot.

Section 91.203(a) prohibits operation of a civil aircraft "unless it has within it" an appropriate
and current airworthiness ce1iificate and the aircraft's registration certification. Section
91.203 (b) requires that the airw01ihiness certificate be "displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance
so that it is legible to passengers or crew." Similarly, sections 47.3(b)(2) and 47.3l(c) allow an
applicant for aircraft registration to cany "in the aircraft" the second copy of the registration
application as temporary authority to operate without registration. These documents demonstrate
that the aircraft is appropriately certificated and registered, or is in the process of being
registered. Additionally, the FAA has previously addressed the requirement to display the

                                95
                                                                                                                                                     2

airworthiness certificate and found that the regulation permits displaying the certificate so that it
is only legible to the flight crew even if not legible to passengers. See Legal Interpretation to
Leonard A. Ceruzzi, from Donald P. Byrne, Acting Assistant Chief Counsel, Regulations and
Enforcement Division (Aug. 7, 1990). Accordingly, we find that maintaining these documents at
the pilot's control station would meet the intent of the rule as the pilot would be able to produce
the documents for his or her own information or to an FAA inspector.
We note that this memorandum is to be narrowly construed to unmanned aircraft systems and is
not intended to apply to operation of manned aircraft or optionally piloted aircraft with a pilot on
board.
