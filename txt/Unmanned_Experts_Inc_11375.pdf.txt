                                                           Exemption No. 11375
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015-0090

Mr. Mr. Drew A. Jurkofsky
Unmanned Experts, Inc.
720 South Colorado Boulevard
Penthouse North
Denver, CO 80246

Dear Mr. Jurkofsky:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated January 15, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Unmanned Experts, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct precision aerial surveying.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is an Aeryon SkyRanger.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Unmanned Experts, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Unmanned Experts, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Aeryon SkyRanger
         when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
         other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within the
         visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used to
         satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability.
         The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times; electronic
         messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must be
         designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the duration
         of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties required of the
         VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (herein referred to as
Reform Act) and 14 CFR Part 11, Unmanned Experts, a small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS)
consultancy and training firm, hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation
Regulations (FARs) to allow commercial operation of sUAS for precision aerial surveying, so long as
such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or as may be
established by the FAA as required by Section 333.

As detailed in this document and the attached Aeryon SkyRanger User Guide (herein referred to as
User Guide), the requested exemption would permit the operation of sUAS under controlled
conditions in airspace that is 1) limited, 2) predetermined, 3) controlled as to access and 4) would
provide safety enhancements to the already best practices safety protocols followed by Unmanned
Experts. Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of
Transportation's responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems in the national airspace system." Section 333(c) Reform Act.

The name and address of the applicant is:

AUTHORITY FOR EXEMPTIONS

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA authority to issue exemptions. This statutory
authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under §40101 of the Act, including
sUASs, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current airworthiness certificate.

The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under
subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections §44702-44716 of this title if the Administrator
finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 USC §44701(f). See also 49 USC §44711(a); 49 USC
§44704; 14 CFR 91.203(a)(1).

Section 333(b) of the Reform Act assist the Secretary in determining whether sUASs may operate in
the national airspace system without creating a hazard to the user, the public, or a threat to national
security. In making this determination, the Secretary must consider:

     The sUAS' size, weight, speed and operational capability;
     Whether the sUAS operates within the visual line of sight of the operator;
     Whether the sUAS operates outside of highly populated areas and away from close proximity

         to airports.

Reform Act 333(a). If the Secretary determines that a sUAS "may operate safely in the national
airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft in the
national airspace system." Id. 333(c).

The Aeryon SkyRanger is a multirotor aircraft weighing 6.5 pounds, including payload. It has the

ability to operate under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 30 knots and has the capability to

hover and move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously. The sUAS will operate only in
the pilot's or visual observer's visual line of sight at all times. Such operations will insure that the
sUAS will "not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public." Reform Act

Section 333(b).

Given the small size of the sUAS involved and the restricted environment within which they will
operate, our application falls squarely within the zone of safety (an equivalent level of safety) in which
Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption, allow commercial operations of sUASs to
commence immediately. Also due to the small size of the UAS and the low altitudes in which our
sUAS will operate, approval of the application presents no national security issue.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness certificates

Subpart H, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of airworthiness certificates as
required by FAR §91.203(a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area associated with the aircraft
to be utilized by Unmanned Experts, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements of
an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation
Act (49 USC §44701(f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft
from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed,
operational capability and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular sUAS. In all
cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the sUAS operated without an airworthiness
certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed, will be at least as safe, or
safer, than a conventional aircraft operating with an airworthiness certificate without the restrictions
and conditions proposed.

14 CFR 45.23(b): Marking of the aircraft

This regulation requires that certain experimental, provisionally certified aircraft, or light-sport
category aircraft to be marked with letters between 2 inches and 6 inches high "limited", "restricted,"
"light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," near each entrance to a cabin, cockpit or pilot station.

Even though the UAS will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be needed as the sUAS
will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the word "Experimental" can be

placed. Given the size of the sUAS, 2 inch lettering will be impossible. Unmanned Experts will mark
the sUAS with the organization's name and address. An insurance barcode attached to the aircraft will

also be linked to Unmanned Experts.

14 CFR 61.113(a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command

Sections 61.113(a) and (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the sUAS will
not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent level of safety of
current operations by requiring the pilot operating the aircraft to have completed a UAS flight training
course of 100 hours before flying a sUAS. Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and
passengers, the sUAS is remotely controlled with no living thing or cargo on board. The area of
operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance as set
forth in the User Guide. The risks associated with the operation of the small UAS are so diminished
from the level of risk associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted,
that allowing operations of the sUAS as requested exceeds the present level of safety achieved by 14
CFR 61.113(a) and (b).

14 CFR 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition.
As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this exemption be granted,
no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft and
the requirements contained in the User Guide for maintenance and use of safety checklists prior to
each flight an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

14 CFR 91.9(b)(2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking and placard requirements

The sUAS, given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight manual on the
aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no room or capacity to carry
such an item on the aircraft.

The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the User Manual at the ground control
point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to it.

14 CFR 91.103: Preflight action

This regulation requires each pilot in command take certain actions before flight to ensure the safety of
flight. An exemption is needed from this requirement as the pilot will take separate preflight actions,
including checking for weather conditions, checking flight battery requirements, checking takeoff and
landing distances, and all other actions in the User Guide and safety checklists. These actions will
provide an equivalent level of safety.

14 CFR 91.109: Flight instruction

Section 91.103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that
is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls.

By design, sUASs and remotely piloted aircraft do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight
control is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft via radio
communications. The equivalent level of safety is provided by the fact that neither a pilot nor
passengers will be carried in the aircraft, the ability to control the sUAS via radio signals from the
controller and by the size and speed of the aircraft.

14 CFR 91.119: Minimum safe altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119(d) allows
helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person operating the
helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the FAA. This exemption
is for a multirotor craft that flies similarly to a helicopter, with vertical takeoff and vertical landing,
which will typically operate at altitudes of 200 feet above ground level (AGL), so an exemption may
be needed to allow such operations. The sUAS will never operate at altitude higher than 400 AGL and
all operations will occur during daylight hours under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) only.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight and speed of the sUAS as well as
the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the permission of the property owner
or local officials. Because advance notice to the property owner and any onsite personnel, as well as
the precautions outlined below, all affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations.

Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all non-participating persons (persons other
than the pilot in command (PIC) or visual observer (VO)), vessels, vehicles and structures, unless:

1. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect non-participating persons from

debris in the event of an accident. The PIC will ensure that non-participating persons remain

under such protection. If a situation arises where non-participating persons leave such

protection and are within 500 feet of the sUAS, flight operations will cease immediately
and/or;

2. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the land
    owner/controller has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
    the risk of operating closer to those objects and;

3. Operations near the PIC or VO do not present an undue hazard to the PIC or VO, per 14
    CFR 91.119(a).

The sUAS will remain within visual line of sight of the PIC or VO. Flight operations will be
conducted at least 5 miles from an airport and at least 3 miles from any city or densely
populated area. The PIC or VO will provide notification to the local Flight Standards District
Office and airport controller of all operations within 5 miles of an airport. The FAA will have
advance notice of all operations through the filing of notices-to-airmen.

Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than the sUAS
proposed herein and carrying flammable fuel, any risk associated with our operations is far less
than those presently presented with helicopters and other conventional aircraft operating at or
below 500 feet AGL. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the sUAS will ensure
separation between these UAS operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must
comply with Section 91.119.

14 CFR 91.121: Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating the aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the sUAS may not have a barometric

altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent

level of safety will be achieved by the PIC confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on

the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR 91.151(a): Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

Section 91.151(a) outlines fuel requirements for beginning a flight in VFR conditions. Our
sUAS is limited to operations in controlled environments and has a limited flight time which
require an exemption from 14 CFR 91.151(a).

The battery powering the sUAS provides approximately 50 minutes of powered flight. To meet
the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR 91.151, sUAS flights would be limited to
approximately 20 minutes in length. Given the limitations on the sUAS's proposed flight area
and the location of its proposed operations within a predetermined area, a longer time frame for
flight in daylight VFR conditions is reasonable.

An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 40 minutes, or enough

battery reserve to ensure that the sUAS lands at the ground station with at least 20% of battery

Unmanned Experts                   PROPRIETARY                                              Page 5 of 8

power (as determined by the onboard monitoring system and the PIC), whichever happens first.
This restriction would be more than adequate to return the sUAS to its planned landing zone
from anywhere in its limited operating area.

14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b): Carrying civil aircraft certification and registration

The sUAS has no cabin, cockpit or pilot station and is operated without an onboard pilot.
Therefore, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or to
display them on the sUAS.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access to them, to the extent
they are applicable to the sUAS.

14 CFR 91.405(a); 407(a)(1); 409(a)(2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as provided
in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this
chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

Given that these sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate,
these sections will not apply to Unmanned Experts. Maintenance will be accomplished by the
operator pursuant to the User Guide. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because
these sUASs are very limited in size and will carry a small payload and operate only in
restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise, the sUAS can land
immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL. As provided in the User
Guide, the operator will ensure that the sUAS is in working order prior to initiating flight,
perform required maintenance and keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the
operator is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in
an airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

PUBLIC INTEREST

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUASs for precision aerial surveys
enhances safety while reducing risk. Manned aircraft monitoring and surveying creates a
greater risk because the craft are much larger, have combustible fuel, and carry an onboard
human pilot. In contrast, a sUAS weighing 6.5 pounds and powered by batteries eliminates
virtually all of that risk given the reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on board.
The sUAS will carry no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks
associated with manned aircraft flights.

Conducting aerial surveys with the Aeryon SkyRanger, instead of manned aircraft, will greatly
benefit the public by drastically reducing the levels of air and noise pollution generated during
traditional aerial survey flight operations. By using battery power and electric motors, the

SkyRanger produces no air pollution and is a viable, environmentally conscious alternative to
the cabin class, six cylinder internal combustion twin engine aircraft that are typically utilized
for aerial surveys, while burning approximately 20-30 gallons per hour of leaded aviation fuel.
The SkyRanger, while reducing the carbon footprint of aerial surveys, also reduces noise
pollution as the sUAS is propelled by battery powered electric motors rather than an internal
combustion engine.

EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Unmanned Experts proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that
have the characteristics and that operate within the limitations listed herein. These limitations
provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current
regulatory structure because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to the
already safe protocols followed by aerial survey operations conducted with helicopters and
other conventional aircraft.

Unmanned Experts will be bound by the following limitations when conducting its sUAS
operations under an FAA issued exemption:

    1. The sUAS will weigh less than 6.5 pounds.
    2. Flights will be operated within line of sight of a pilot and/or observer.
    3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 40 minutes. Flights will be

         terminated at 20% battery power reserve should that occur prior to the 40 minute limit.
    4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.
    5. Flight operations will be conducted 5 miles from an airport and at least 3 miles from any

         city or densely populated area, which are depicted in yellow on VFR sectional charts.
    6. Flight operations within 5 miles of an airport require notification and approval from the

         local Flight Standards District Office and airport controller.
    7. Flight operations will occur during daylight hours and under visual meteorological

         conditions only.
    8. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations through the filing of notices-to-

         airmen.
    9. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS pilot and visual observer.
    10. The sUAS pilot will be an FAA licensed airman with at least a private pilot's certificate

         and third class medical.
    11. The pilot and visual observer will have been trained in the operation of the sUAS.
    12. The pilot and visual observer will at all times be able to communicate by voice and/or

         text.
    13. Written and/or oral permission from the relevant property holders will be obtained.
    14. Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all non-participating persons,

         vessels, vehicles and structures unless:
             a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect non-participating persons
                  from debris in the event of an accident. The pilot will ensure that non-participating
                  persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where non-participating

                  owner/controller has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
                  assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and;
             c. Operations near the pilot or visual observer do not present an undue hazard to
                  the pilot or visual observer.
    15. If the sUAS loses communication or loses its GPS signal, the sUAS will have the
         capability to return to a safe, pre-determined location and land.
    16. The sUAS will have the capability to abort flight in case of unpredicted obstacles or
         emergencies.

PRIVACY

All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's prior
consent and knowledge. Images taken will be of individuals who have also consented to being
filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where aerial photography will take place.
