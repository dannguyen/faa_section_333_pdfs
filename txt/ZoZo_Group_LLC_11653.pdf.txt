                                                           Exemption No. 11653
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAAГ2015Г0661

Ms. LaSheita Sayer
ZoZo Group, LLC
700 East 24th Avenue, Suite 2
Denver, CO 80205

Dear Ms. Sayer:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 13, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of ZoZo Group, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial imagery documentation of highway construction projects.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom FC40 P330.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. Д 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, ZoZo Group, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR ДД 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, ZoZo Group, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom FC40
         P330 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of
         any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR Д 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR Д 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR Д 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR Д 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR ДД 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

 3. STATUTORY AUTHORITY

         The Pederal Aviation Act grants the PAA authority to issue exemptions to any
regulations made pursuant to this title under 49 U.S.C. Д44701(f), should the exemption be
deemed to be in the public interest.

         Section 333(b) of the Reform Act gives guidance in determining whether a UAS may
operate safely within the National Airspace System (NAS) without creating hazard to the user or
the public. The factors to be considered under this subsection are:

         и The size, weight, speed, and operational capability of the UAS;
         и Whether the operation of the UAS will be in close proximity to airports and

                   populated areas; and
         и Whether the operation of the UAS will be within visual line of sight of the

                   operator.

4. PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS

        Applicant is a public relations firm specializing in the management of public information
   services on public works projects, primarily through the Colorado Department of
   Transportation (CDOT). Applicant's role on these projects is to provide accurate and timely
   information to the taxpaying public of Colorado regarding government funded construction
   projects. Applicant serves on public works projects throughout the State of Colorado and is
   typically involved in 25 to 35 public information projects each year, each requiring weekly or
   monthly progress imaging. Due to the limited ground-level accessibility of construction sites,
   one challenge Applicant has encountered is the inability to fully demonstrate the effective
   use of taxpayers' dollars through ground level imaging.

        Applicant also proposes to use the UAS to enhance the safety of its team that document
   the progress of each construction project. The UAS will substantially improve safety
   conditions for Applicant's team by allowing members to remain a safe distance from traffic
   and construction equipment while documenting the progress of each construction project.

        In order to more safely and effectively illustrate the progress on public works projects,
   Applicant requests exemptions from FAR provisions concerning the commercial use of civil
   aircraft in the national airspace (NAS). Granting this exemption will help provide improved
   public information regarding highway construction and improve safety conditions for
   Applicant's employees.

 5. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

    The following conditions and limitations, to which Applicant agrees to be bound, provide for
at least an equivalent level of safety to operations under the current regulatory scheme. The
conditions and limitations proposed for the commercial operation of the UAS owned and
operated by Applicant are as follows:

1. The UAS will weigh less than fifteen pounds, including payload.
2. Flights will operate at speeds of less than 40 knots
3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 10 minutes or less.
4. Flight time, date, and location will be recording before and after each operation.

ZoZo Group, LLC  Petition for Exemption - Requests for UAS  Page 4of 12
5. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.
6. Operations will occur during normal Visual Flight Rule Meteorological Conditions
7. UAS Pilot will be Pilot in Command (PIC).
8. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the PIC who will keep the UAS within his

    visual line of sight at all times. One or more Visual Observers may also be present for
    operations, if determined necessary by the PIC.
9. The PIC will be trained in flight operations and safety procedures as detailed in the
    submitted flight operations and procedures manual.
10. The PIC will hold at least a current third-class medical certificate.
11. Notification to stakeholders will be delivered prior to the scheduled flight operations.
    Stakeholders will be identified in accordance with the public information specifications set
    forth by the public entity for each project. Notification may be provided on the flyers
    distributed to notify such stakeholders of the project start.
12. The UAS will be programmed to return to a pre-determined location within the secure
    perimeter and land should the UAS lose communications or GPS signal.
13. The PIC will complete a customized UAS flight course, to be commissioned and designed
    by a professional instructor.
14. Operations will not take place over densely populated areas or within five miles of an
    airport. The UAS will not be operated by the PIC from a moving vehicle.
15. Prior to proposed operations, the PIC will have completed UAS training described above
    and will have logged at least one successful takeoff and landing in the proceeding 90 days
    with the UAS to be used in the proposed operations in order to ensure that the UAS is in
    good operating condition.
16. The PIC will land the UAS prior to battery levels dropping below the manufactures'
    recommended minimum level for safe operations.
17. An integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) on the UAS which allows the UAS to hover
    and land safely if communication with remote control pilot is lost will be initiated prior to all
    operations.

    Because Applicant plans to use this small aircraft in low-speed, low-altitude operations only
under normal weather conditions within the VLOS of the pilot, the operation of the aircraft by

Applicant in the National Airspace System will not pose a threat to public safety and should be
exempted from the regulations listed above.

 6. SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates; 14 C.F.R. 91.203(a)(1)

         ZoZo Group's UAS is a DJI Phantom FC40 P330 rotorcraft, weighing less than fifteen
pounds, including payload. It carries no hazardous or flammable materials, is unmanned, and
operates at speeds of no more than 40 knots. The aircraft can hover and move in a vertical and
horizontal plane simultaneously and is equipped with remote link failsafe including a "return to
home" feature. Flight operations will only take place in a predetermined and limited area during
normal weather conditions and always within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot in
Command (PIC). All operations will fall within Class G airspace, under 400 feet AGL.
Applicant therefore seeks complete relief from this Section.

14 C.F.R. 45.23(b) - Display of Markings

         The size of the DJI Phantom UAS makes it impossible to mark the aircraft in accordance
with Section 45.23(b). Labeling areas of the aircraft is unnecessary because the UAS will have
no entrance, cabin, cockpit, or pilot station. Applicant therefore seeks complete relief from this
Section.

14 C.F.R. 61.113 (a)-(b)- Private Pilot privileges and limitations; Pilot in Command (PIC)

          14 C.F.R. 61.113 restricts a person with a private pilot's certificate from being the PIC in
a commercial flight. Due to the size and weight of Applicant's UAS, the condition that no
passengers or pilot will be carried on board, and the condition that no property will be
transported, Applicant proposes an alternative requirement for the PIC of their UAS.

      The limited size, weight, and operational capacity of the DJI Phantom in combination with
the restrictions on use detailed above eliminates the need for a commercial pilot with the in-
depth aeronautical knowledge required in commercial pilot licensure. The limited capacity of the
battery in the DJI Phantom UAS restricts the overall flight time of the aircraft. The DJI

ZoZo Group, LLC  Petition for Exemption - Requests for UAS  Page 6of 12
Manufacturer suggests that the maximum battery life is between 15-18 minutes. Applicant
proposes a limitation on flight time to ensure that the UAS retains enough charge to safely land
and make any emergency maneuvers. In light of the estimated battery life, no flights shall go
longer than 10 minutes per battery charge or shall use more than 80% ofbattery life during each
flight operation. Additionally, the DJI UAS is also equipped with failsafe modes to alert the
operator when battery life is no longer able to support the continued flight of the UAS. Page 15
of the FOPM explains emergency battery procedures for this DJI Phantom UAS. An equivalent
level of safety provided by the regulations in 14 C.F.R. 61.113 (a)-(b) can be achieved by pairing
a basic aeronautical understanding along with a customized UAS-specific training program
designed for Applicant's specific use of the UAS. Given the unique operational capabilities and
safety features of Applicant's UAS, Applicant proposes that the PIC not be required to hold a
commercial pilot certification. Instead, Applicant proposes its operators should be required to:

    и Complete a customized UAS flight school course, to be commissioned and designed by a
         professional instructor.

    и Be trained in flight operations and safety procedures as detailed in the submitted flight
         operations and procedures manual.

    и Have logged at least one successful takeoff and landing in the proceeding 90 days with
         the UAS to be used in the proposed operations in order to ensure that the UAS is in good
         operating condition.

    и Complete the checklist provided in the FOPM prior to operation.

14 C.F.R. 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

         The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. In light of the size, features, and nature of proposed use, Applicant seeks complete
relief from this section.

Applicant proposes a pre-flight inspection checklist to be completed prior to each flight
operation in place of such airworthiness certificates which will include:

    и Checking battery condition and levels in both the transmitter and UAS.
    и Establishing communication between the transmitter and UAS.
    и A visual check for power lines, antennas and other overhead objects.

ZoZo Group, LLC  Petition for Exemption - Requests for UAS  Page 7of 12
    и Evaluation of wind and weather conditions.

14 C.F.R. 91.9(b)(2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft.

         The applicant proposes that all materials suggested in 14 C.P.R.Д 91.9(b), Д 91.203(a)
and (b),Д 47.3(b)(2), and 47.31(c) be available at the ground station within reach of the PIC
during flight operations. Because the manufacturer of the DJI phantom does not have an FAA-
approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual, a supplementary customized Flight Operations and
Procedures Manual (FOPM) will be created by Applicant. Applicant will thus satisfy the intent of the
regulation.

14 C.F.R. 91.103- Preflight action

         The pre-flight checklist proposed above, to be included in the FOPM, will provide an
equivalent level of safety to that provided by the regulations in this section. Before each flight,
the PIC will perform all pre-flight check items listed above including reviewing weather,
checking battery levels, aircraft performance data, and estimates of landing and takeoff
distances.

14 C.F.R. 91.109- Flight Instruction

         This Section provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free
balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual
controls.

          By its design, UAS do not include dual controls or any type of throw-over controls to aid
in flight instruction. However, because the transmitter is hand-held, an instructor can take over
control of the UAS easily by simply handing the controller to the instructor. This will provide an
equivalent level of safety as the dual-control feature provides in commercial aircraft during
training and instruction.

14 C.F. R. 91.119- Minimum safe altitudes: General

          Due to the size and speed of Applicant's UAS, the device may be operated at less than
the minimums prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section. The regulation states that over
populated areas the aircraft cannot be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle,

ZoZo Group. LLC  Petition for Exemption - Requests for UAS  Page 8of 12
or structure. Since the typical photo assignment would be photography of unopened intersections
and/or roads, it may become necessary to operate at distances closer than 500 feet. Due to the
small size and weight of the UAS and the type of locations it will be flying over, operating the
device at a closer proximity would not adversely affect public safety or national security. Also
the UAS will not carry a pilot or any passengers and will also not store any types of flammable
or hazardous liquids on board therefore greatly reducing any potential harm.

         An equivalent level of safety to that achieved by this provision will be achieved in
Applicant's proposed operations given the size, weight, and speed of the UAS as well as the
nature of the proposed use of the UAS. The majority of flight operations will take place over
closed construction sites and other sparsely populated areas. No flight will be taken without
notice to identifiable stakeholders.

14 C.F.R. 91.121- Altimeter settings

         The DJI Phantom does not have a barometric altimeter. Instead, the device has a GPS
altitude read out. Applicant seeks complete relief from this Section. An equivalent level of
safety will be achieved by use of the GPS altitude indicator to confirm the altitude of the launch
site shown before flight, pursuant to the FOPM Manual and Safety Check list.

14 C.F.R. Д 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

         Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under
VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel
to fly to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed- (1) During the
day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45
minutes."

         Due to the specifications of the DJI Phantom its battery does not allow for flights longer
than 15 minutes. Given that flight operations will typically be completed in 7-10 minutes,
requiring a reserve of30 minutes of power would be impractical for Applicant's UAS. Further,
the intention in the proposed operations of the UAS is to photograph/video record areas which
typically under three miles in length in a very short period of time.

14 C.F.R. 91.203 (a)-(b)- Civil Aircraft; Certifications Required

The regulation provides in part:
    (a) Except as provided inД 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within
         it the following:
         (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate....
         (2) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
              paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under Д91.715 is
              displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

         Because Applicant's UAS weighs less than fifteen pounds and lacks the capacity to carry
any additional materials, aside from its battery and the attached camera; in order to achieve an
equivalent level of safety the applicant proposes that the paperwork required by 91.203 to be
located at the ground station, immediately accessible to the PIC.

14 C.F.R. 91.405, 14 C.F.R. 91.407, 14 C.F.R. 91.409, 14, C.F.R. 91.417- Inspections,
Maintenance required, Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding
or Alteration, Maintenance Records

         Section 91.405(a) requires, in pertinent part, that an aircraft operator or owner shall have
the aircraft inspected and shall, between required inspections, have any deficiencies repaired.

         Section 91.407(a)(l) prohibits, in pertinent part, any person from operating an aircraft
that has undergone maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, or alteration unless it has
been approved for return to service by a person authorized under Section 43.7.

         Section 91.409(a)(2) prescribes, in pertinent part, that no person may operate an aircraft
unless, within the preceding year, it has had an inspection for the issuance of an airworthiness
certificate.

         Section 91.417(a) and (b) prescribes, in pertinent part, that records of maintenance must
be kept.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because Applicant's small UAS is very limited in
size and will carry a small payload consisting only of a camera, and operate only in restricted
areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise, the UAS can land immediately and
will never exceed an altitude of 400 feet AGL. Further, because there is no certified inspection
facility for the DJI Phantom UAS, it is impossible for Applicant to comply with these
regulations.

Pursuant to 14 C.P.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal
Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:
14 C.P.R. Parts 21- Subpart H; 14 C.P.R. 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R 61.113 (a)-(b); 14 C.P.R. 91.7 (a);
14 C.P.R. 91.9 (b) (2); 14 C.P.R. 91.103; 14 C.P.R. 91.109; 14 C.F. R. 91.119; 14 C.P.R. 91.121;
14 C.P.R.Д 91.151(a); 14 C.P.R. 91.203 (a)-(b); 14 C.P.R. 91.405 (a); 14 C.P.R. 91. 407 (a) (1);
14 C.P.R. 91.409 (a) (2); 14 C.P.R. 91.417 (a) -(b) to operate commercially a small unmanned
vehicle (55lbs or less) for aerial imagery documentation of highway construction projects.

         Approved commercial flight operations would result in more comprehensive and
effective public information provided to drivers and the tax-paying public of Colorado regarding
construction projects in the state. Additionally, approval of this exemption would help increase
public safety by making project documentation protocol safer. Current procedures endanger the
safety of Applicant's team by requiring team members to enter potentially unsafe construction
zones to document progress. Applicant's use of a UAS will allow to more accurately and safely
capture high resolution images ofproject progress.

          The size, weight, and limited operational capabilities of the DJI Phantom UAS owned by
Applicant provide no substantial risks to the integrity or safety of the NAS and poses no threat to
national security. The UAS will not carry any passengers or a pilot, will not contain any
flammable or hazardous materials, and will always operate in Class G airspace at speeds lower
than 40 knots. Along with the physical features of the UAS itself, the procedures imposed by this
exemption create a level safety that is equivalent or greater than the safety provided by current
regulations.

Cautions for Product Use

        Before use of the product, please accept some flight training (Using a simulator to practice flying, getting
        instruction from a professional person, etc.).
        Check that all parts of the multi-rotor are in good condition before flight. Do not fly with aging or broken parts.
        Check that the propellers and the motors are installed correctly and firmly before flight. Make sure the rotation
        direction of each propeller is correct. Do not get close to or even touch the working motors and propellers to
         avoid serious injury.
         Do not over load the multi-rotor (should be less than 1200g).
         Make sure that the transmitter battery and flight battery are fully charged.
         Try to avoid interference between the remote control transmitter and other wireless equipment.
         Make sure to switch on the transmitter first, then power on the multi-rotor before takeoff! Power off the
         multi-rotor first, then switch off the transmitter after landing!
         The fast rotating propellers of PHANTOM will cause serious damage and injury. Always fly the multi-rotor 3m or
         above away from you and unsafe conditions, such as obstacles, crowds, high-voltage lines, etc. FLY
         RESPONSIBLY.
         All parts must be kept out of the reach of children to avoid CHOKE HAZARD; if a child accidentally swallows any
         part you should immediately seek medical assistance.

  8. The LED may blink Yellow 4 times quickly(««««). Start motor is disable during LED blinking Yellow 4 times

      quickly(««««), as the system is warming up.

и After the system start and self-checking has finished, if the LED blinks Red, Yellow and Green continually, that

means the ltviU data is abnormal. The PHANTOM will not work, please connect to the Assistant Software and

follow the tips to do operation. If it blinks red and yellow lights alternately         that means the

compass error is too big, it can be caused by the following three cases. Please connect to the Assistant Software,

select the "tools" tab and follow the tips of the "ltviU Calibration" to do operation.

1. There are ferromagnetic substance around; first make sure that the compass has been calibrated correctly, you

can lift the aircraft up (about 1m from the ground), and stay away from the surrounding possible ferromagnetic

material object, if there is no red and yellow flashing after lifting it up about 1m from the ground, then it will not

affect the flight.

2. The compass module had been put near a magnet; in this situation please timely replace the compass for a new
one, otherwise it will lead to some abnormal action, or even loss of control.

3. The compass is not properly calibrated; in this situation please calibrate the compass correctly again, please see
the GPS compass calibration for details.

7. GPS & Compass Calibration

If the Compass Module is not used, you can skip this step.

The GPS module has a built-in magnetic field sensor for measuring the geomagnetic field, which is not the same in
different areas. The GPS module will not work unless the Compass Module has been connected. Make sure the
Compass Module connections are correct.
Please always keep the compass module away from the magnet. If this situation occurs please change the compass
module before flying. Otherwise it may damage the compass module and lead the aircraft to work abnormally or even
be out of control.

                                                                                                                                   Make sure to keep away from
ferromagnetic substance and other electronic equipment when calibrating or flying. If you keep having calibration
failure, it might suggest that there is magnetic interference or other ferromagnetic substance, please avoid flying in this
area.

1. Quickly switch the control mode switch from ATTl. Mode to GPS A TTl.
   Mode and back to ATT/. Mode for 6 to 10 times, The LED indicator will turn

to constantly yellow.                                                                      GPS ATTl. Mode

2. Rotate your aircraft around the horizontal axis (about 360░) until the LED                      ATTl. Mode
                                                                                        ATTl. Mode->GPS ATTl. Mode ->
changes to constant green, and then go to the next step.                                ATTl. Mode is one time , quickly

3. Hold your aircraft vertically and rotate it (its nose is downward) around the                 switch 6 to 10 times

vertical axis (about 360░) until the LED turns off, meaning the calibration is

finished.

4. If the calibration was successful, calibration mode will exit automatically. If the

calibration has failed, the LED keeps flashing quickly Red. Switch the control

                       the calibration, and then re-start from  l.

l. If in GPS A TTl. Mode, place the aircraft in an open space without buildings or trees. Take off the aircraft

     after 6 or more GPS satellites are found (Red LED blinks once or no blinking). If in A TTl. Mode, you can skip
     this step.
2. Place the aircraft 3 meters away from you and others, to avoid accidental injury.
3. Start-up
  ./ Switch on the transmitter first, then power on multi-rotor! Keep the aircraft stationary until the system

         start and self-check has finished.
  ./ Please wait for the system to warm up gradually with the LED blinks Yellow 4 times quickly(««@«). You

         should not start the motors until the blinking disappears.
   ./ Keep the aircraft stationary, and execute the CSC to start the motors.

  ./ Release the yaw, roll and pitch sticks and keep them at the neutral position, at the same time raise the
         throttle stick from the bottom. The motors will stop if you do not push the throttle stick from the bottom
         within 3 sec and you will need to re-start the motors.

  ./ Keep raising the throttle stick until all the rotors are working, push the throttle stick to the mid position
         and then take-off your multi-rotor gently, pay attention not to push the stick excessively.

  ./ Pay attention to the aircraft movement at any time, and use the sticks to adjust the aircraft's position.
         Keep the yaw, roll, pitch and throttle sticks at the mid position to hover the aircraft at desired height.

4. Lower the aircraft slowly until touch down is achieved. The motors will stop automatically after 3 seconds, or

     you can repeat the start-up stick command to stop the motors sooner.
                                                                                                        tr::mo.mitt<>r after landing.

./ DO NOT fly near to ferromagnetic substances, to avoid strong magnetic interference with the GPS.
./ It is recommended to land the aircraft slowly, to prevent the aircraft from damage when landing.
./ If the Transmitter indicates low-battery alert, please land ASAP. In this condition the Transmitter may cause

      the aircraft to go out of control or even crash.

The flowchart of failsafe and how to regain control

An introduction of Go-Home and Landing.

Home-point: Every time you power on, after fi~st motors start, and if 6 or more GPS satellites are found (Red light blinks
once or no blinking) for 10 seconds, the current position of multi-rotor will be saved as home-point by MC automatically.

    The flowchart of failsafe and how to regain control(the following content is for the firmware v3.12)
    This section will demonstrate the working logic of failsafe and how to regain control.
    The following description is effective only when:
   l. The aircraft is in flight.

    2. The GPS works normally and signal is GOOD (;~6 satellite, the LED blinks a single red light or
    no red light).

                                                    during (l) or (2), it will resume normal flight immediately.
                                                           the aircraft will slow down and hover.

If you want the aircraft to Return Home, please do not turn the                          If you choose to turn off the transmitter,
               back on within 3 seconds*, otherwise the aircraft will exit               you must be pretty sure that you know

This product is not suitable for people under the age of 18. Please carefully read the "Quick

Start Guide", "User Guide", disclaimer, and fully watch the "Quick Start Videos" before

using the PHANTOM. Users should make every effort to fly regularly in order to improve

their flight skills as an advanced level pilot  ) . Please fly safely and responsibly.

Please follow these guidelines prior to flying your Phantom:

               turn on the Remote Controller prior to turning on the Phantom.
    Toggle SL S2 to the top.
     Be sure there are no distractions when you're flying.
     When starting your training, be sure you are in a very large open area. Be aware of your
    surroundings. Always fly in areas void of obstacles and away from traffic and people.
     Before actually taking off, be sure you have calibrated the compass and you have full
    GPS satellite reception (Slow Continuous Green Flashing).
     Never fly over 400 feet.
     During training, stay behind your imaginary barrier and never fly behind yourself.
     When in doubt, gently pull down on the throttle stick and land.
     DO NOT PANIC.

The aircraft camera should face AWAY from the pilot before takeoff.    CAUTION
DO NOT fly the Phantom within a radius of 2 meters.                  FORBIDDEN
DO NOT touch the propellers after the Phantom has been started.      NO TOUCH
Take off and land with battery facing you.

Hover in one spot keeping battery facing you, make
sure to control Left/Right/Forward/Back movement.

Rotate left, rotate   but try to keep the battery
pointed at yourself.
Slowly fly forward/back/left/right with back of
Phantom pointed at yourself.

Fly forward to a spot 20-30 feet away.
Then fly back keeping the battery pointed at yourself.

 tv1ark a spot (B) on the ground lOft away from the Phantom's
take off point. Hover and fly towards that spot and land at
the spot (B). Then go back into a hover and bring the Phantom
 back to its original position (A) and land again.
