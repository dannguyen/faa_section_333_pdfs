                                                           Exemption No. 11643
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0606

Mr. Dennis M. Fisher
President
Rapid Mortgage Company
272 West Central Avenue
Springboro, OH 45066

Dear Mr. Fisher:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 2, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft
system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography, videography, and cinematography to enhance
community awareness and to augment real estate videos.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received one comment in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.
                                                                                                                 2

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Dennis M. Fisher is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Dennis M. Fisher is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

RE: Petition For Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act of the Federal
Aviation Regulations from 14 C.F.R. Part 91.7(a); 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a);
91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(1)&(2); 91.417(a)&(b)

To whom it concerns,

I, Dennis M. Fisher, President of Rapid Mortgage Company, am writing pursuant to the
FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and the procedures contained within 14
C.F.R. 11, to request that I, Dennis M. Fisher, an FAA licensed Commercial Pilot with
ASEL, AMEL, Instrument Airplane and Glider ratings and Flight Instructor ratings in ASEL,
Instrument Airplane and Gliders and operator of small unmanned aircraft such as the
Phantom 2 Vision +, be exempted from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed
below so that I, Dennis M. Fisher on behalf of my company Rapid Mortgage Company,
may operate ultra-lightweight unmanned aircraft systems ("UAS") commercially in
airspace regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA").

As described herein I, Dennis M. Fisher, am a licensed, HUD approved mortgage lender
based in the State of Ohio; experienced in flying fixed wing aircraft and gliders for
commercial and recreational purposes. I intend to use a Phantom 2 Vision + with a High
Definition still and video camera for aerial photography/videography/cinematography to
enhance community awareness for those individuals and companies unfamiliar with or
desiring a unique perspective of the geography of the community; and augmentation of
real estate listing photos and videos following exemption and approval by the FAA,
thereby enhancing their research for the area being reviewed.

I have flown various aircraft for over 27 years ­ all without incident. Additionally, while
not rated in helicopters, I have flown helicopters and understand the concepts of rotary
flight. Every flight I make is approached with safety in mind. I refuse to compromise
my personal minimums in aircraft, and these UAS flights are no different.

My exemption request would permit operation of ultra-lightweight, unmanned (piloted by
remote control) UAS(s) in a tightly controlled environment for preplanned flights in areas
away from the general public, airports, heliports and vehicular traffic for community
videos and within property boundaries for real estate listing videos/photos.

I, Dennis M. Fisher, have developed the appropriate safety protocols and controls to
prevent hazards to the public as well as manned aircraft. If deemed appropriate, use of
these safety protocols is encouraged to further the safe utilization of ultra-lightweight

NMLS 126841                  272 West Central Avenue  Springboro, OH  45066         MB.802955.000

UAS's specific to real estate video and photography usage as I, Dennis M. Fisher will
retain recorded flight data and other information gained through permitted flight
operations to share with the FAA through any reports the FAA may request to assist with
safety regulation.

Granting my, Dennis M. Fisher's, request comports with the Secretary of Transportation's
(FAA Administrator's) responsibilities and authority to not only integrate UAS's into the
national airspace system, but to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of
such aircraft systems [UAS's] in the national airspace system" under Section
333(c) of the Reform Act specific to the use of UAS's for real estate purposes. Further I,
Dennis M. Fisher, will conduct my operations in compliance with the protocols described
herein or as otherwise directed by the FAA.

For the reasons stated below I, Dennis M. Fisher, respectfully request the grant of an
exemption allowing me to operate ultra-lightweight, remote controlled UAS's for
community awareness to benefit/stimulate attraction to our business market area and to
enhance real estate listing videos for owners who cannot afford expensive manned
aircraft for the same purpose. Both of these purposes promote local economic growth
through increased employment and increased tax base. Additionally, the public's safety
is kept in mind by avoiding the use of heavier manned aircraft containing combustible
fuel posing a potential public hazard.

III. The Extent of Relief Dennis M. Fisher Seeks and the Reason He Seeks Such
Relief:

I, Dennis M. Fisher, submit this application in accordance with the Reform Act, 112 P.L.
95 §§ 331-334, seeking relief from the applicable FARs prohibiting me, Dennis M. Fisher,
from performing commercial photographic, cinematic, and other flight operations within
the national airspace system. The Reform Act in Section 332 provides for such
integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into our national airspace system as it is in
the public's interest to do so. My, Dennis M. Fisher's, ultra-lightweight UAS meets the
definition of "small unmanned aircraft" as defined in Section 331 and therefore the
integration of my ultra-lightweight UAS is expressly contemplated by the Reform Act.

I am requesting this exemption to permit the operation of an ultra-lightweight UAS prior
to the time period which the Reform Act requires the FAA to promulgate rules governing
such craft. Approval of my request will provide direct experience and valuable data for
implementation of regulations administered uniformly to all real estate related UAS aerial
video and photography.

The Reform Act guides the Secretary in determining the types of UAS's that may operate
safely in our national airspace system. Considerations include: The weight, size, speed
and overall capabilities of the UAS's; whether the UAS will be operated near airports or
heavily populated areas; and, whether the UAS will be operated by line of sight. 112 P.L.
95 § 333 (a). Each of these items aligns with my, Dennis M. Fisher's request for
Exemption. The Phantom 2 Vision + utilizes four (4) counter-rotating propellers for
balance, control and stability. The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS is equipped with GPS and
auto return safety technology. Weighing less than six (6) pounds (far below the
maximum 55 pound limit), including camera and gimbal mount.

I, Dennis M. Fisher, consider safety foremost with each flight. The Phantom 2 Vision +
UAS is designed to hover in place via GPS and operate in relatively calm wind conditions.
For safety and stability flight operations will not be conducted when winds exceed 10
knots. Built-in safety systems include a GPS mode allowing the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS
to hover in place when remote controls are released.

Flight operations will utilize the "Ready To Fly" mode for aerial
videography/photography. "Ready To Fly" restricts flight to programmed Special Area
Limits, Max Height and Max Radius, further enhancing safety of operations and stability
while preventing accidents and hazards. When pilot communication is lost the Phantom 2
Vision + UAS is designed to return to the point of takeoff.

My Exemption request would allow flight operations up to 200' AGL outside of a 2 mile
radius from towered airports and 1 mile from non-towered airports; outside of a 3 mile
radius from any airport, maximum flight operating altitude will be 400' AGL. I recognize
previous exemptions have been granted prohibiting flight operations within 5 nautical

NMLS 126841                  272 West Central Avenue  Springboro, OH  45066         MB.802955.000

miles of an airport. Given the petitioner's extensive experience as a commercial pilot (in
excess of 2,500 hours of flight time) and thorough understanding of traffic patterns and
instrument approach minimums, I believe this is a reasonable request that will prevent
hazards to aircraft and property while serving the community.

Flight operations will not be conducted over densely populated or congested areas, and
at least 500' from non-participating people, vessels, vehicles and structures.
Constant vigilance will be maintained for any manned aircraft and the petitioner will be
prepared to land/abort immediately to the nearest and safest ground point should a
manned aircraft approach, or appear to approach the area of flight operations.

The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS is capable of vertical and horizontal operations, and will be
flown only within a visual line of sight. Utilizing battery power rather than combustible
fuels, flights are generally expected to last no more than 10-15 minutes, utilizing 40-
60% of the Phantom 2 Vision +'s battery capacity. Each flight will utilize a fresh, fully
charged battery for each flight; full flight time limit for each battery is 25 minutes as
tested. The UAS will not be operated below 40% of battery charge levels to maintain a
safe operating reserve, ensuring adequate communication between the PIC remote
control and the UAS. Reserve batteries are on hand for each flight to ensure an adequate
source of power is available to safely complete each operation.

I, Dennis M. Fisher, am extremely cautious when operating ANY aircraft and have no
intention of creating a hazard to other aircraft, property or persons when operating the
Phantom 2 Vision + UAS/ultra-lightweight unmanned aircraft. My flight operations will
not "create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public." 112 P.L. 95
§ 333 (b). Given the small size and weight of the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS, it falls well
within Congress's contemplated safety zone when it promulgated the Reform Act and
the corresponding directive to integrate UAS's into the national airspace system.

IV. How Dennis M. Fisher's Request Will Benefit the Public As A Whole:

Aerial videography for geographical awareness and real estate marketing has been
around for decades through manned fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. For small real
estate companies and average homeowners the expense of such aerial videography is
cost prohibitive. Typically upscale Realtors or luxury homeowners are in a position to
afford such an expense. As a result, the expense of manned aerial photography deprives
many homeowners and smaller Realtors of a valuable marketing tool.

Congress has already proclaimed it is in the public's interest to integrate commercially
flown UAS's into the national airspace system, hence the passing of the Reform Act.
Granting my, Dennis M. Fisher's exemption request furthers the public interest through
visual awareness of the geographical benefits in and around the markets I serve. The
Phantom 2 Vision + ultra-lightweight UAS is battery powered and creates no emissions
that harm the environment.

The public's interest is furthered by minimizing potential ecological damage by
permitting aerial video/photo capture through the Phantom 2 Vision + battery operated
ultra-lightweight UAS. Permitting me, Dennis M. Fisher, to immediately fly within the
national air space system furthers economic growth. Granting my exemption request
substantially furthers the economic impact for the community I serve by assisting
companies considering our market for relocation or building, as well as individuals
relocating for career advancement by providing our aerial photographic services and
improving geographical awareness. Both aspects serve as a stimulus to the community.

V. Reasons Why Dennis M. Fisher's Exemption Will Not Adversely Affect Safety
Or How The Exemption Will Provide a Level of Safety At Least Equal To Existing
Rule:

My, Dennis M. Fisher's, exemption will not adversely affect safety. Quite the contrary, for
the reasons stated permitting me, Dennis M. Fisher, to log more flight time in FAA
controlled airspace, communicate with the FAA, and allow me to contribute to the
innovation and implementation of new safety protocols. In addition I, Dennis M. Fisher,
submit the following representations of enhancements to current aerial videography and
photography for real estate:

The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS weighs less than 6 pounds with max payload, high
definition video camera and gimbal mount;

Flight operations will be limited to a maximum height of 400' AGL outside of a 3 nautical
mile radius of any airport and 200' AGL outside of a 2 nautical mile radius of towered
airports and 1 mile from non-towered airports;

Flight operations will be conducted for the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS a maximum of 15
minutes per flight;

The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS will be landed prior to manufacturer recommended
minimum level of battery power;

The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS will be operated through remote control by visual line of
sight;

The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS has a GPS flight safety fail safe feature whereby it returns
to its point of takeoff and lands if communication with the remote control pilot is lost;

Flight data and other sources of information are continually reviewed to update and
enhance safety protocols;

NMLS 126841                  272 West Central Avenue  Springboro, OH  45066         MB.802955.000
             Phone: (937) 748-8888  Fax: (937) 748-9358  Toll Free: (888) 305-2342
Flight operations will be conducted in a safe manner and tightly controlled environment,
away from power lines, elevated fixtures, structures and lights, airports and congested
and densely populated areas;

Extensive pre-flight inspections along with weather and risk assessments are conducted
prior to each flight, the objective being execution of a safe flight operation being the first
priority;

All necessary permissions and notification will be obtained prior to operation;

Finally, procedures are established to abort flights in the event of safety breaches or
potential danger.

My, Dennis M. Fisher, safety protocols provide a level of safety equal to or greater than
existing rules. It should be is important to note that absent the integration of
commercial UAS into the national airspace system, helicopters are the primary means of
aerial video and photography for community education and real estate marketing. While
the overall safety record of such helicopters may be satisfactory, the exposure to the risk
involved, potential loss of life and substantial property damage cannot be ignored; it is
far safer to operate a battery powered ultra-lightweight UAS.

First, the potential loss of life is diminished because UAS's carry no passengers or crew
on board and flight operations are conducted away from densely populated areas.
Second, with no combustible fuel on board a UAS, the potential for fire or explosion is
eliminated. Third, the small size and extreme maneuverability of the Phantom 2 Vision
+ UAS enables quick and safe avoidance of hazards.

VI. A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:

A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like.

14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for
procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR §

91.203(a)(1). The size, weight and limited operational area of the Phantom 2 Vision +
UAS permits exemption from Part 21 because the UAS meets (and exceeds) an
equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act. The FAA is
authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement under both
the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces of
legislation permit the FAA to exempt UAS's from the airworthiness certificate
requirement in consideration of the weight, size, speed, maneuverability and proximity
to areas such as airports and dense populations. The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS meets or
exceeds each of the elements.

NMLS 126841                  272 West Central Avenue  Springboro, OH  45066         MB.802955.000
             Phone: (937) 748-8888  Fax: (937) 748-9358  Toll Free: (888) 305-2342
14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness
certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the
FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no
onboard pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is
inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a
safety/flight manual delineating areas of where safety can be defined. The FAA has
previously issued exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738,
9299, 9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 10700 and 32827.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121 regarding altimeter settings is inapplicable insofar as the Phantom 2
Vision + UAS utilizes electronic global positioning systems with a barometric altimeter
sensor.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b) provides for the carrying of civil aircraft certifications and
registrations. They are inapplicable for the same reasons described above. The
equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining any such required certifications
and registrations by me, Dennis M. Fisher.

B. 14 C.F.R. § 45.23: Marking of The Aircraft.

Applicable Codes of Federal Regulation require aircraft to be marked according to certain
specifications. The Phantom 2 Vision + UAS is, by definition, unmanned. They
therefore do not have a cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or
phrases. Further, two-inch lettering is difficult to place on such small aircraft with
dimensions smaller that minimal lettering requirement. The FAA has previously issued
exemptions to this regulation through Exemptions Nos. 8738, 10167, 10167A and
10700.

C. 14 C.F.R. § 61.113: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: PIC.

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113 (a) & (b), private pilots are limited to non-commercial
operations. I, Dennis M. Fisher, holder of a Commercial pilot certificate will exceed the
requirements of the current Regulations even though the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS does
not carry any pilots or passengers.

D. 14 C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

14 C.F.R. § 91.119 prescribes safe altitudes for the operation of civil aircraft. It allows
helicopters to be operated at lower altitudes in certain conditions. The Phantom 2 Vision
+ UAS will never operate at an altitude greater than 400' AGL. I, Dennis M. Fisher, will
operate the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS safely, away from densely populated and congested
areas, providing a level of safety equivalent to or in excess of those in relation to

NMLS 126841                  272 West Central Avenue  Springboro, OH  45066         MB.802955.000
             Phone: (937) 748-8888  Fax: (937) 748-9358  Toll Free: (888) 305-2342
minimum safe altitudes. Given the size, weight, maneuverability and speed of the
Phantom 2 Vision + UAS an equivalent or greater level of safety will be achieved.

E. 14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance
Inspections.

The above-cited Regulations require, amongst other things, aircraft owners and
operators to "have [the] aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and
shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of
this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter...."

These Regulations apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. They will not,
therefore, apply to the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS. As a safety precaution, I will perform a
thorough preflight inspection of the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS just as I would any aircraft
I am PIC of before each flight.

In summary, Dennis M. Fisher seeks an exemption from the following
Regulations:

14 C.F.R. § 91.7 (a); § 91.109; 14 C.F.R. § 91.119; 14 C.F.R. § 91.121; 14 C.F.R. §
91.151(a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.405 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.407 (a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409
(a)(2); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409 (a ) (2); and, 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.417 (a) & (b) to commercially
operate the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS, small unmanned vehicle/lightweight unmanned
aircraft vehicle in community awareness and real estate operations, and to develop
economic platforms for real estate to enhance the experience of those seeking to
relocate to the markets my business services.

Currently, geographic area awareness and real estate aerial videography/photography
relies primarily on the use of larger aircraft carrying significant quantities of, and running
on combustible fuel, posing potential risk to the public. Granting my, Dennis M. Fisher's,
request for exemption will reduce current risk levels and thereby enhance safety. The
Phantom 2 Vision + UAS does not contain potentially explosive fuel, is smaller, lighter
and more maneuverable than conventional real estate video and photographic aircraft
and achieves aerial objectives in much less flight time.

Further, by operating at lower altitudes and in controlled airspace, the potential public
risk is avoided without the need to fly to and from established air fields. I, Dennis M.
Fisher, as an active Certified Flight Instructor and commercial rated pilot have a
thorough understanding of flight information and will compile safety protocols and the
implementation of a flight operation's manual for real estate usage that exceeds
currently accepted means and methods for safe flight.

Formal collection of information shared with the FAA will enhance the FAA's internal
efforts to establish protocols for complying with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of

NMLS 126841                  272 West Central Avenue  Springboro, OH  45066         MB.802955.000

2012. Since there is no crew or passengers aboard my, Dennis M. Fisher's UAS, the
likelihood of death or serious bodily injury is minimized. My, Dennis M. Fisher's,
operation of the Phantom 2 Vision + UAS, weighing less than 6 pounds and travelling at
lower speeds within limited areas will provide an equivalent level of safety as that
achieved under current FARs. Accordingly I, Dennis M. Fisher, respectfully request the
FAA grant my exemption request and am willing to cooperate in sharing information to
benefit the FAA, safety of manned aircraft, and the general public at large.
