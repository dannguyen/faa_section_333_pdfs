                                                      Exemption No. 11230A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0604

Mr. Ronald Wingo
Chief Executive Officer
Montico, Inc.
2710 North Argyle
Fresno, CA 93727

Dear Mr. Wingo:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letters dated May 19 and June 3, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on behalf of Montico, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to
your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an
amendment to add the Steadidrone Mavrik, Align M690L, Aeryon Labs Skyranger, Aeryon
Labs Scout, Aibotix X6, and DJI Inspire.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11230
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11230 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision +, Steadidrone Mavrik, Align M690L, Aeryon Labs Skyranger, Aeryon Labs
         Scout, Aibotix X6, and DJI Inspire when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on March 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Dear Sir or Madam,

This is a request for an amendment to FAA Exemption 11230, Docket No. FAA-2014-0604 and the
corresponding COA granted to Montico, Inc. to further define uses and additional purposes.

Montico, Inc. will operate sUAS' for aerial inspection and documentation. Some of the uses will be, but
not limited to, telecommunication tower facilities, utility power transmission and distribution facilities,
wind power generation facilities, gas and oil pipeline facilities, bridge infrastructures, aerial mapping and
agriculture data collection.

Montico, Inc. will operate the following additional sUAS':

           Steadidrone "Mavrik" and the Align M690L. Attached are the Flight Operations Manuals for both
           platforms.

In order to accomplish continuity of services, it is operationally necessary to conduct aerial inspections
within areas previously restricted in our exemption and COA. We have instituted the following
operational procedures to mitigate any undue hazards:

           a) The sUAS will clear and yield the right away to all other manned operations and activities at
                 all times.

           b) When within 5 nautical miles from an airport having an operational control tower the PIC
                 will contact ATC prior to flight.

           c) When within 3 nautical miles from an airport having a published instrument flight
                 procedure, but not having an operational control tower the PIC will utilize a VHF air band

               transceiver to announce Montico's presence.

           d) When within 2 nautical miles from an airport not having a published instrument flight
                 procedure or an operational control tower the PIC will utilize a VHF air band transceiver to
                 announce Montico's presence.

           e) When within 2 nautical miles from a heliport the PIC will utilize a VHF air band transceiver to
                 announce Montico's presence.

           f) When within altitudes between two hundred and four hundred feet, the PIC will contact the
                appropriate ATC prior to flight and/or utilize a VHF air band transceiver to announce
                 Montico's presence.
          Because the requested amendment would not set any precedent or otherwise raise any novel issue, and
          because Montico, Inc. seeks to begin these operations without delay, Montico, Inc. respectfully requests
         the FAA to determine that good cause exists so that notice does not need to be published in the Federal
          Register and grant the requested amendment expeditiously by summary means.

         Any questions please contact the undersigned.
