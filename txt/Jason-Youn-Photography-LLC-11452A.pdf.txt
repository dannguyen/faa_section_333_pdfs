                                                      Exemption No. 11452A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0233

Mr. Edward Youn

Mesa, AZ 85202

Dear Mr. Youn:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 29, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Jason Youn Photography, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment
to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an
amendment to add the DJI Phantom 31.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

1 In the May 29, 2015 letter to amend Exemption No. 11452, the petitioner also requested to add all future DJI
Phantom iterations, as well as all commercially available UAS under 55 pounds in compliance with all
provisions of proposed Part 107. Petitions for exemption under Section 333 currently must identify the make
and model of the aircraft for consideration.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11452
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11452 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom
         Vision 2 Plus+, DJI S900, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3 when weighing less than
         55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a
         new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Dear Sir or Madam,

! Jason Youn Photography LLC would like to submit the following as an
amendment to Docket No FAA-2014-0233.
This is a petition to amend Exemption No. 11452:

! Due to rapidly advancing UAS technology in both performance and safety
mechanisms, Jason Youn Photography would like to amend Exemption No. 11452 to
include more aircraft than are listed in the original exemption.
! These new unmanned aircraft (UAS) have several added safety mechanisms
including but not limited to:
*Ground looking cameras for more stability in flight.
*More accurate GPS systems for greater reliability.
*More reliable lifting motors to run the thrust propulsion systems.
*More reliable computer based Engine Control Units.
*Higher resolution video feeds to ground for greater situational awareness.
*More flight data sent to the ground controls for grater situational awareness.
*More reliable fail safe features for greater safety on the ground.

! ! For these added safety reasons Jason Youn Photography would like to
add the DJI Phantom 3 series and future Phantom iterations of the popular UAS to the
list of approved aircraft.

The above paragraph is in keeping with the FAA's publicly stated goal of maintaining
flexibility to accommodate future technological innovation.

Yours,
Jason Youn
