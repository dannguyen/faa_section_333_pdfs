                                                           Exemption No. 12634
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1486

Mr. Henry H. Perritt, Jr.
Modovolate Aviation, LLC
1131 Carol Lane
Glencoe, IL 60022

Dear Mr. Perritt:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 22, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Modovolate Aviation, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial data
collection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received seven comments in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are a DJI Phantom 3, DJI Inspire, Cinestar 8 HL,
3DRobotics IRIS+, and FreeFly ALTA.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Modovolate Aviation, LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Modovolate Aviation, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3,
    DJI Inspire, Cinestar 8 HL, 3DRobotics IRIS+, and FreeFly ALTA when weighing
    less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will
    require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

Re: Summary Exemption Request under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11
of the Federal Aviation Regulations from certain parts of the FARs.

Dear Administrator Huerta:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Modovolate Aviation, LLC, an Illinois limited liability
company ("Movo Aviation," the "LLC, or the "Petitioner"), hereby applies for a
summary exemption from the listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow it
to operate small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUAS") for aerial data collection, under
the conditions and limitations set forth in this Petition.

The requested exemption would permit the operation of small, unmanned and
relatively inexpensive sUAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is (1) limited,
(2) predetermined, and (3) would provide safety enhancements to the already safe news
gathering operations presently using manned helicopters and airplanes. Approval of
this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the FAA Administrator's
responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems in the national airspace system." Section 333(c) of the Reform Act.

The name and address of the applicant is:

The Appendix describes the FARs from which an exemption is requested and
summarizes the justification for each requested exemption.

The Petition is submitted to fulfill Congress' goal under Section 333(a) through (c) of the
Reform Act, which directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether certain
unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS)
before completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In
making this determination, the Administrator must determine which types of UASs do
not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security
in light of the following:

· The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;

· Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and

· Operation of the UAS within visual line of sight of the operator.

Reform Act § 333 (a).

If the Adminstrator determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the national
airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such
aircraft in the national airspace system." Id. § 333(c) (emphasis added).

The Secretary has delegated his aviation authority to the Administrator of the FAA.

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to grant exemptions
from its regulatory requirements for civil aircraft, a term defined under §40101 of the
Act, which includes sUASs. The Administrator may grant an exemption from a
requirement of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any
sections 44702-44716 of the Federal Aviation Act if Administrator finds the exemption
in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. § 44701(f) See also 49 USC § 44711(a); 49 USC § 44704; 14
CFR §91.203 (a) (1).

Modovolate Aviation, LLC, is an Illinois limited liability company organized for the
purpose of conducting microdrone research, experimentation, demonstration,
education and aerial photography.

Movo Aviation was formed and is jointly owned by Henry H. Perritt, Jr. and Eliot O.
Sprague.

3
Henry H. Perritt, Jr., the Chief Executive Officer of the LLC and its General Counsel, is a
law professor and former dean at Chicago-Kent College of Law, the law school of
Illinois Institute of Technology. Holding a bachelor of science degree in aeronautics and
astronautics from MIT, a master of science degree in management from MIT's Sloan
School, and a juris doctor degree from Georgetown University Law Center, Mr. Perritt
has written dozens of law review articles and several books on how the law should
adapt to technological innovation. He is a private helicopter and airplane pilot, with an
instrument airplane rating.

Eliot O. Sprague is Chief Operating Officer of the LLC. A graduate of Hillsboro Aero
Academy, he is a full-time news helicopter pilot, helicopter flight instructor, director for
a Chicago-area on-demand commercial helicopter operator, and a member of the board
of directors of Midwest Helicopter Association. He is intimately familiar with
commercial aviation and familiar with the threats that unregulated microdrone flight
present to the safety of himself, his coworkers, his passengers, and to persons and
property on the ground. He holds commercial helicopter and airplane, instrument
helicopter, commercial flight instructor-rotary wing, and commercial flight instructor ­
instrument-rotary wing ratings.

Messrs Perritt and Sprague have authored a number of articles published in aviation
and journalism magazines and in law reviews explaining how sUAS can enhance the
public interest, boost economic productivity and be operated so as to assure the safety
of the national airspace system.

The Petitioner and its officers have flown a variety of sUAS for recreational and
hobbyist purposes, including the Parrot AR, the DJI Phantom, and the Cinestar 8 HL.
They have assembled a Cinestar 8 HL, and a Birdseye View FireFLY6 tiltrotor.

Now, a number of people, some professional colleagues and some strangers, have heard
about Petitioner's activities and are pressing Petitioner to undertake aerial data
collection for compensation.

The Petitioner has been advised by counsel that this is not now permissible unless he
obtains special permission from the FAA. Many competitors of Petitioner are actively
flying sUAS to conduct aerial photography for commercial purposes, notwithstanding
the FAA's stated prohibition. Petitioner also notes and has read the congressional
mandate in sections 332 and 333 of the FAA Revitalization and Reform Act of 2012 that

4
the FAA move quickly to accommodate the economic and societal benefits that can
result from widespread deployment of sUAS technology. Accordingly, Petitioner
applies for authorization under the Federal Aviation Act, and the FARs rules to
undertake the following activities for commercial purposes. Unless the Petition is
granted, Petitioner will be at a significant competitive advantage if it, as it prefers,
complies with FAA policy.

Vehicle

The Petitioner will fly the following sUAS:

     DJI Phantom 3
     DJI Inspire
     Cinestar 8 HL
     3DRobotics IRIS+
     FreeFly ALTA

All these vehicles have built in capability to limit the height they fly above the ground,
to limit the radius of the distance the fly from the operator, and to exclude them from
class B, C, and D airspace. The vehicles also have the built-in capability to return to the
launching point if the wireless control link is interrupted or if the operator attempts to
exceed any of the height, radius, or airspace limitations programmed into it.

The largest vehicle--the Cinestar 8 HL-- weighs about five pounds empty and has a
maximum gross weight of approximately twenty pounds. The others weigh less and
have correspondingly smaller payloads. All of them have top speeds of about 30 knots.
All of them are multicopters with fixed-pitch rotors, thrust from which is varied by
changing RPM. All of them are powered by lithium polymer batteries.

Flight profiles

The Petitioner will program its aircraft so that they will not fly above 400 feet above
ground level, or more than 1500 feet away from the operator. The operator will
carefully preflight the vehicle before each mission to assure that its compass and GPS
system are properly calibrated and that the return-to-home feature, altitude, and radius
limitations work.

5
The operator will operate its vehicles on aerial data collection, aerial photography, news
gathering, training, and demonstration missions only under the following
circumstances:

    1. The UA will not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour).
         In no case will the UA be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum UA
         operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.

    2. The UA will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground
         level (AGL). Altitude will be reported in feet AGL.

    3. The UA will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         The PIC will use human vision unaided by any device other than corrective
         lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or U.S.
         driver's license.

    4. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA will be operated
         within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO
         may be used to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always
         maintains VLOS capability. The VO and PIC will be able to communicate orally
         at all times; electronic messaging or texting will not occur during flight
         operations. The PIC will be designated before the flight and will not transfer his
         or her designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC will ensure that the VO
         can perform the duties required of the VO.

    5. The requested exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and
         conduct its operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations of the
         requested grant of exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating
         documents. The operating documents will be accessible during UAS operations
         and will be made available to the Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy
         exists between the conditions and limitations in this exemption and the
         procedures outlined in the operating documents, the conditions and limitations
         will take precedence and be followed. Otherwise, the operator will follow the
         procedures as outlined in its operating documents. The operator may update or
         revise its operating documents, and track such revisions and present updated
         and revised documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official
         upon request.

6
    6. If the operator determines that any update or revision would affect the basis
         upon which the FAA granted the requested exemption, the operator will petition
         for an amendment to its grant of exemption.

    7. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
         operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component,
         will undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under
         the requested exemption. Functional test flights will only be conducted by a PIC
         with a VO and will remain at least 500 feet from other people. The functional test
         flight will be conducted in such a manner so as not to pose an undue hazard to
         persons and property.

    8. The operator is will maintain and inspect the UAS to ensure that it is in a
         condition for safe operation.

    9. Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine
         the UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection will account for
         all potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If
         the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the
         aircraft will not be operated until the necessary maintenance has been performed
         and the UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

    10. The operator will follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
         replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
         components.

    11. Each UAS operated under the requested exemption will comply with all
         manufacturer safety bulletins.

    12. All PICs will hold either an airline transport, commercial, private, recreational, or
         sport pilot certificate. The PIC will also hold a current FAA airman medical
         certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a state, the District of
         Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal government. The
         PIC will also meet the flight review requirements specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in
         an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

    13. The operator will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
         ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will
         be operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers
         and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and
         structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner

7
         consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the
         operator's PICs and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and
         determining the PIC's ability safely to operate the UAS in a manner consistent
         with how the UAS will be operated under this exemption will occur under the
         terms of the requested exemption. Training operations will only be conducted
         during dedicated training sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-
         building flights, all persons not essential for flight operations are considered
         nonparticipants, and the PIC will operate the UA with appropriate distance from
         nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.
    14. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1.
         All operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
         Flights under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.
    15. The UA will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point
         (ARP) as denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for
         airports not denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on
         the current FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with
         that airport's management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued
         to the exemption holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management
         will be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon
         request.
    16. The UA will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
         horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
         PIC.
    17. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the operator will cause
         the UA to return to a predetermined location within the private or controlled-
         access property.
    18. The PIC will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or
         emergencies.
    19. The PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather
         conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the intended
         operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
         power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.
    20. All operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
         exemption holder will apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct

8
         operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the COA attached to the
         requested exemption.
    21. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption will be identified by
         serial number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have
         identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart
         C. Markings will be as large as practicable.
    22. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the
         UAS and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be
         available to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the
         aircraft is operating.
    23. These documents will be made available to the Administrator or any law
         enforcement official upon request.
    24. The UA will remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
         activities at all times.
    25. The UAS will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.
    26. All Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
         persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:

             a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating
                  persons from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The
                  operator will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such
                  protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such
                  protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight operations will cease
                  immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of nonparticipating persons'
                  and

             b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
                  permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a
                  safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and
                  determined that it does not present an undue hazard.

    27. The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
         nonparticipating persons under the requested exemption.

    28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
         boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA will be
         reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.

9
         Accidents will be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
         according to instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

The Petitioner's proposed operations satisfy the criteria provided in Section 333 of the
Reform Act relating to size, weight, speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports
and populated areas and operation within visual line of sight and national security. The
Petition justifies grant of the requested exemptions allow the Petitioner to obtain aerial
photography with its sUAS.

Granting the petition would be in the public interest because:

    1. The Congress of the United States has determined that early accommodation of
         sUAS into the National Airspace System advances the public interest. The
         Committee Report leading the House to adopted H.R. 658 said:

         "The successful integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the
         National Airspace System (NAS) can support more than 23,000 high-paying jobs
         in the United States. . . . The absence of a plan to integrate UASs into the NAS is a
         barrier to such job creation . . . ."1

         Granting the Petition represents a step toward such integration, in the absence of
         a comprehensive regulatory regime for sUAS, and thus would serve the
         Congressional goal and the public interest.

    2. Granting the Petition would facilitate the creation, display, and public
         distribution of art, long recognized as advancing the public interest. They are at
         the core of the activities that the First Amendment to the United States
         Constitution seeks to promote and to protect from governmental restrictions.

         Creative photography and video art fall well within the First Amendment's
         protections. "Entertainment, as well as political and ideological speech, is
         protected; motion pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live

         entertainment, such as musical and dramatic works fall within the First
         Amendment guarantee. "2

    3. Granting the Petition would enable new forms of news coverage, enabling the
         public to know about and to understand newsworthy events, an activity
         similarly within the core of First Amendment protections. 3

    4. Granting the petition would enable Petitioner to demonstrate the commercial
         viability of creating art and gathering news with new aeronautical technology
         Commercial creative art is protected as well as non-commercial art.4 The Patents
         and Copyrights Clause of the United States Constitution and the copyright
         statute's protection of visual art and audiovisual works embody the proposition
         that more creative effort with respect to these kinds of work will be exerted when
         the creators are allowed to be paid for their works, thus increasing the
         production of artistic works.

section 1983 suit by citizen who was arrested for using cellphone camera to photograph
arrest).

11
         Granting the petition will allow the petitioner to respond to economic incentives
         to increase its creative production. The result will be an increase in the stock of
         artistic photography, including video for public enjoyment.

         A significant part of the Petitioner's activities involve capturing and
         disseminating visual representations of newsworthy events. Receiving
         compensation for these newsgathering activities using traditional technologies
         incentivizes Petitioner, resulting in greater output of news. The new technologies
         embodied in sUAS enable different perspectives on the news not easily
         obtainable by traditional means. Allowing Petitioner to be compensated for
         using the new technologies will provide an incentive for it to intensify its
         collection and dissemination efforts.

         The rules from which Petitioner seeks exemption artificially and irrationally limit
         the effective use of new technologies to enhance news gathering, thereby
         subverting the public interest.

    5. Granting the Petition will fulfill the FAA's own declaration that encouraging
         new aviation technologies advances the public interest. The FAA itself has
         recognized the public interest in its role of "Encouraging and developing civil
         aeronautics, including new aviation technology."5 Granting the Petition will
         enhance FAA fulfillment of that commitment, thereby serving the public interest.
         Air commerce flourishes in the United States because of the rapid pace of
         innovation in aeronautical and associated technologies, followed by their
         commercialization and their introduction of the marketplace. The drone
         technology that the Petitioner uses exemplifies the latest innovative leap forward
         in aeronautical technology. Preventing it from using this in air commerce
         subverts achievement of the goal.

    6. Granting the Petition will fulfill the Congressional determination that integrating
         sUAS technology into the NAS serves the public interest. Section 330 of the FAA
         Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, specifically recognizes the advantages to
         air commerce obtainable from the deployment of sUAS technologies. It
         mandated several steps by the FAA to accelerate the availability of these

5 FAA, Safety: The Foundation of Everything We Do,

12
         technologies in the National Airspace System, thereby representing a
         congressional determination that the public interest is served by making these
         technologies more widely available at the earliest practicable date. The Petition
         represents a way for the FAA to move incrementally, while still satisfying its
         congressional mandate and meeting its obligation to enhance the public interest
         by making new technologies available by allowing the use of sUAS technologies
         in a manner that protects the public and the rest of the aviation community from
         significant risk.

         The commercial activities by Petitioner proposed in the Petition represent
         contributions to new forms of air commerce, thereby fulfilling the FAA's
         statutory mandate under the 2012 Act.

    7. Granting the Petition will enhance aviation safety, thereby advancing the public
         interest. The Petitioner has committed itself in the Petition to safety practices that
         reduce or eliminate hazards to aircraft in the National Airspace System and to
         persons and property on the ground. Many others are flying sUAS without
         regard to these hazards. Granting the Petition will offer the Petitioner up as an
         example of how the FAA is willing to accommodate the new technology when it
         is constrained by appropriate limitations to enhance safety. It will also allow the
         Petitioner to be a role model for safe commercial sUAS operations.

         Users of the National Airspace System are confronted by mushrooming threats
         from sUAS flown in defiance of the FAA's ban. Unless the FAA shows some
         flexibility to accommodate lawful and safe operation of sUAS for legitimate
         commercial purposes, the level of defiance will increase, intensifying the hazards
         to manned aircraft and to persons and property on the ground.

The Petition to use a UAS for aerial data collection and its proposed limitations are
similar in all material respects to those approved by the FAA in Grants of Exemption
Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc.
(see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0382), 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642) and
11310 to Colin Hinkle (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0608). In those grants the FAA found
that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the
specifications described by the Petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather

13
than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to
flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by
this exemption is in the public interest.
The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, 11213,
and 11310 also apply to the situation presented by this Petition.
