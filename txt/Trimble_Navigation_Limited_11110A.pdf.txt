                                                      Exemption No. 11110A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0367

Mr. James A. Kirkland
Trimble Navigation Limited
935 Stewart Drive
Sunnyvale, CA 94085

Dear Mr. Kirkland:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition to amend Exemption No.
11110. It explains the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists the revised
conditions and limitations.

By letters dated March 4 and April 14, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Trimble Navigation Limited (hereinafter petitioner or
operator) for an amendment to Exemption No. 11110. That exemption from §§ 61.113(a) and
(b); 91.7(a); 91.119 (c); 91.151(a)(1); 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409(a)(1) and (2); and
91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to
conduct precision aerial surveys that consist of still photographs taken by an onboard camera.
You requested an amendment to add a new aircraft, the Trimble UX-5 hp, and to revise
Condition nos. 4, 15, 16 (Pilot in Command), no. 19 (fuel requirements), no. 20 (Certificate of
Waiver or Authorization (COA) requirements), and removing nos. #29 and #30 (operating
parameters).

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant is comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

The FAA has updated the conditions and limitations since the petitioner's initial grant of
exemption to those found in Exemption No. 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (Docket No. FAA-
2014-0642). Also in Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to
VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), the FAA found that the enhanced
safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the
petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly
greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to
find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an amendment to an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of an amendment is in the public interest.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11110
remains valid with respect to this exemption and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the
authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the
Administrator, Trimble Navigation Limited is granted an amendment to its exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                                                  3

Conditions and Limitations

The conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11110 have been superseded,
and are amended as follows.

In this grant of exemption, Trimble Navigation Limited is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Trimble UX5 and
         Trimble UX5 hp when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
         permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
                                                                                                              4

    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                              5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                                 6

   22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
       number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
       documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
       a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
            from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
            that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
            where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
            the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
            of nonparticipating persons; and
       b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
            for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
            the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not present
            an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                  7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
         a. Dates and times for all flights;
         b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
             under this grant of exemption;

                    FAA Docket 2014-0367

 Dear Sir or Madam:

          On March 4, 2015 Trimble Navigation LTD (hereinafter" Trimble"), through its
 attorneys, submitted an application for an Amendment to Exemption 11110, originally issued
 December 10,2014 in FAA Docket 2014-0367, to allow operation of an updated model of its
 UAS, the UX5hp. Given the recent changes in the terms of other exemptions issued by the FAA
 under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Trimble hereby files this
 supplemental amendment request to allow Trimble's UX5 and UX5hp to be operated under the
 same terms and conditions that the FAA has granted to other UAS operators under Section 333,
 as most recently reflected in Exemption 11240, Aerius Flight LLC, and Exemption 11257, Roger
 W. Meyer, PLS, which granted a Section 333 exemption involving a Trimble UX5 aircraft.

          Specifically, Trimble requests that its Exemption 11110 be amended to not only allow it
 to operate its UX5hp aircraft as stated in the March 4, 2015 request, but that the following
 provision of its Exemption 11110 be removed or modified, as noted below, or, alternatively, the
 conditions in Exemption 11240 and Exemption 11257 be substituted in their entirety.

          Specifically, Trimble requests that the following modifications be made to Exemption
 11110:

           1.) Amend Exemption 11110 condition #4 by adding language " ... or U.S. driver's
                    license" at the end of the second sentence. (See Exemption 11240.)

          2.) Amend Exemption 11110 condition #15 by removing the present language and
                   substituting the following: review requirements specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an
                   aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate." (See Exemption
                    11240.)

          3.) Amend Exemption 11110 condition #16 by removing the present language and
                    substituting the following:

          To the extent necessary, Trimble refers the FAA to its original exemption request
 submitted in Docket FAA-2014-0367 for a listing of regulations (as amended by Exemption
 11 11 0) for which an exemption is being sought; a demonstration of the public interest; and a
 showing of an equivalent level of safety. Because the UX5hp is essentially the same aircraft as
