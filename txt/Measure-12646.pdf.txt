                                                           Exemption No. 12646
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1602

Mr. Brandon Torres Declet
Measure, a 32 Advisors Company, LLC
1875 Connecticut Avenue, NW.
10th Floor
Washington, DC 20009

Dear Mr. Declet:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letters dated May 4, 2015, and June 8, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Measure (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for the
purpose of aerial data acquisition.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the aircraft attached to the docket as appendices 1
and 2 in addition to the aircraft approved by the Secretary of the Department of
Transportation for operation under Section 333.1

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection.2 The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

1 The petitioner also proposed to operate additional battery and gas powered UAS. The FAA is assessing the
fuel source and weight of these UAS. When the FAA completes its review, we will proceed accordingly and no
further action will be required by the petitioner.
2 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

As discussed in the conditions and limitations below this exemption is issued to Measures.
Therefore, Measures is the operator of any UAS operations conducted under the terms of this
exemption. Nothing in this letter should be construed as FAA approval of a particular
business model or employment arrangement between the exemption holder and UAS PICs.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Measure is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Measure is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the aircraft approved
         by the Secretary of the Department of Transportation for operation under Section 333
         (Attachment 1) when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
                                                                                                            4

    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
                                                                                                            5

    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.
                                                                                                            6

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
                                                                                               7

the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be

    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions

    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;
      c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
          the UAS;
      d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
      e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
      f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
          and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those
          who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;
      g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
      h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city,
          town, county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted and the altitudes
          essential to accomplish the operation.
                                                                                                                 8

    31. Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating persons
         consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production, as specified in the
         exemption holder's MPTOM.

Unless otherwise specified in this grant of exemption, the UAS, the UAS PIC, and the UAS
operations must comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to,
parts 45, 47, 61, and 91.
                                                                                      9

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (herein
referred to as FMRA) and 14 CFR Part 11, Measure, a 32 Advisors Company, LLC
(herein referred to as Measure) hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal
Aviation Regulations (FARs) to allow commercial operation of UAS for the acquisition
of aerial data, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions
outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA.

As detailed in this document and the attached Appendix of UAS, the requested exemption
would permit the operation of UAS under controlled conditions in the United States.
Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of
Transportation's responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of
such aircraft systems in the national airspace system." Section 333(c) Reform Act.

The name and address of the applicant is:

AUTHORITY FOR EXEMPTIONS

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under §40101
of the Act, including UAS, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current
airworthiness certificate.

The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed
under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections §44702-44716 of this title if the
Administrator finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 USC §44701(f). See also 49
USC §44711(a); 49 USC §44704; 14 CFR 91.203(a)(1).

Section 333(b) of the Reform Act assists the Secretary in determining whether UAS may
operate in the national airspace system without creating a hazard to the user, the public,
or a threat to national security. In making this determination, the Secretary must consider:

    · The UAS' size, weight, speed and operational capability;
    · Whether the UAS operates within the visual line of sight of the operator;
    · Whether the UAS operates outside of highly populated areas and away from close

         proximity to airports.

Reform Act 333(a). If the Secretary determines that a UAS "may operate safely in the
national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation
of such aircraft in the national airspace system." Id. 333(c).

BACKGROUND ON MEASURE

Measure is one of the world's leading Drone as a Service® companies. Measure provides
turnkey solutions utilizing UAS to deliver specific, low risk, and cost effective actionable
data to clients. Measure was founded specifically to help clients avoid the capital expense
and operating risks of establishing their own drone programs and to purchase drone
support in a way which better fits their operations and cost profiles.

Measure believes in a risk-based and technology agnostic approach to operations in the
national airspace. Approval for any operation should be based on an analysis of the
specific risks associated with the fully integrated solution, rather than the individual
components.

The Measure business model is predicated on identifying requirements, developing the
business case, and demonstrating the Return on Investment (ROI) from UAS for
enterprise clients in a number of industries. Drone as a Service® is a custom integrated
solution made up of seven different components.

UAS AND OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION

Measure seeks to commercially operate a variety of UAS weighing less than 55 pounds
including payload in the United States for the purpose of acquiring aerial data. The
Appendix attached to this exemption petition lists the aircraft that Measure contemplates
operating. In addition, Measure requests that it be granted permission to operate those
aircraft already approved in previous Section 333 exemption petitions.

As the operator of these aircraft, Measure is committed to the following conditions and
limitations on its operations. Measure understands that failure to comply will be grounds
for the immediate suspension or rescission any exemption granted.

    1. Operations are limited to the UAS listed in the Appendix and those UAS
         previously approved by the Secretary when weighing less than 55 pounds
         including payload.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not contemplated.

    3. The aircraft will not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per
         hour). In no case will the aircraft be operated at airspeeds greater than the
         maximum aircraft operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.

! 3!
                                              !

    4. The aircraft will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground
         level (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The aircraft will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot in
         Command (PIC) at all times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision
         unaided by any device other than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's U.S.
         driver's license.

    6. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The aircraft will be operated
         within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.

    7. All operating documents needed to operate the UAS and will be accessible during
         UAS operations and made available to the Administrator upon request. The
         operator will also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for
         extension or amendment.

    8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
         operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component,
         will undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations.

    9. Measure is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
         in a condition for safe operation.

    10. Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
         UAS is in a condition for safe flight.

    11. Measure will follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
         replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
         components.

    12. Each UAS operated under this exemption will comply with all manufacturer
         safety bulletins.

    13. The PIC will hold a UAS flight training certificate, in some cases training directly
         from the aircraft manufacturer, and a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a state,
         the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
         government.

    14. Measure will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
         ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will
         be operated to acquire aerial data, including evasive and emergency maneuvers
         and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and
         structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner

! 4!
                                              !
         consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Measure will operate flights for the purposes
         of training Measure PICs and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-
         building) and determining the PIC's ability to safely operate the UAS.

    15. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1.
         All operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

    16. The aircraft will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point
         (ARP) as denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for
         airports not denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on
         the current FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with
         that airport's management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA.

    17. The aircraft will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
         horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
         PIC.

    18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the aircraft will return
         to a pre-determined location.

    19. The PIC will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

    20. The PIC will be prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and
         forecast weather conditions) there is enough available power or fuel for the
         aircraft to conduct the intended operation and to operate after that for at least five
         minutes or with the reserve power or fuel recommended by the manufacturer if
         greater.

    21. All operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA if the
         blanket COA does not cover the intended operation.

    22. All aircraft operated will be identified by serial number, registered in accordance
         with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification! (N-Number) markings in
         accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as
         practicable.

    23. Documents used by Measure to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS
         and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be available
         to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is
         operating.

    24. The aircraft will remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
         activities at all times.

! 5!
                                              !
    25. The UAS may be operated by the PIC from a moving device or vehicle; however,

         specific requests will be made via subsequent COA.
    26. All flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating

         persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
         a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating
         persons from the aircraft or debris in the event of an accident; or
         b. The owner/controller/operator of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
         permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made an
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it
         does not present an undue hazard.
    27. The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons will not be considered
         nonparticipating persons under this exemption.
    28. All operations conducted over private or controlled-access property will be
         conducted with the permission from the property owner/controller or authorized
         representative. Permission from property owner/controller or authorized
         representative will be obtained for each flight to be conducted.
    29. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
         boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA will be
         reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.
         Accidents must be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
         per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness certificates

Subpart H, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of airworthiness
certificates as required by FAR §91.203(a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area
associated with the aircraft to be utilized by Measure, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart
H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333
of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 USC §44701(f)) and Section 333 of the
Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an
airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational
capability and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UAS. In all
cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the UAS operated without an
airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed,
will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

14 CFR 45.23(b): Marking of the aircraft

This regulation requires that certain experimental, provisionally certified aircraft, or light-
sport category aircraft to be marked with letters between 2 inches and 6 inches high
"limited", "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," near each entrance
to a cabin, cockpit or pilot station. Even though the UAS will have no airworthiness
certificate, an exemption may be needed as the UAS will have no entrance to the cabin,
cockpit or pilot station on which the word "Experimental" can be placed. Given the size
of the UAS, 2 inch lettering may be impossible. Measure will mark the UAS as
practicable.

14 CFR 61.113(a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command

Sections 61.113(a) and (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the
UAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the
equivalent level of safety of current operations by requiring the pilot operating the
aircraft to have completed a UAS flight-training course. Unlike a conventional aircraft
that carries the pilot and passengers, the UAS is remotely controlled. The area of
operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in
advance. The risks associated with the operation of the UAS are so diminished from the
level of risk associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when
drafted, that allowing operations of the UAS as requested exceeds the present level of
safety achieved by 14 CFR 61.113(a) and (b).

! 7!
                                              !

14 CFR 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft Measure
contemplates operating, should this exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard
will exist for determining airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft and the operational
restrictions put on the aircraft, an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

14 CFR 91.9(b)(2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking and placard requirements

The UAS, given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight
manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no
room or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft. The equivalent level of safety will
be maintained by keeping the Operating Manuals at the ground control point where the
pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to it.

14 CFR 91.103: Preflight action

This regulation requires each pilot in command take certain actions before flight to
ensure the safety of flight. An exemption is needed from this requirement, as the pilot
will take separate preflight actions, including checking for weather conditions, checking
flight battery or fuel requirements, checking takeoff and landing distances, and all other
actions in the Operating Manuak and safety checklists. These actions will provide an
equivalent level of safety.

14 CFR 91.109: Flight instruction

Section 91.103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free
balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning
dual controls. By design, UAS do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control is
accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft via
radio communications. The equivalent level of safety is provided by the fact that neither a
pilot nor passengers will be carried in the aircraft, the ability to control the UAS via radio
signals from the controller and by the size and speed of the aircraft.

14 CFR 91.119: Minimum safe altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. The UAS will
never operate at altitude higher than 400 AGL and all operations will occur during
daylight hours under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) only.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight and speed of the
UAS as well as the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the

! 8!
                                              !

permission of the property owner. Because advance notice to the property owner and any
onsite personnel, as well as the precautions outlined below, all affected individuals will
be aware of the planned flight operations.

Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all non-participating persons
(persons other than the pilot in command (PIC) or visual observer (VO)), vessels,
vehicles and structures, unless operations do not present an undue hazard.

The UAS will remain within visual line of sight of the PIC or VO. Flight operations will
be conducted at least 5 miles from an airport. The PIC or VO will provide notification to
the local Flight Standards District Office and airport controller of all operations within 5
miles of an airport. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations through the filing
of notices-to-airmen.

Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than the UAS
proposed herein, any risk associated with our operations is far less than those presently
presented with helicopters and other conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 feet
AGL. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the UAS will ensure separation between
these UAS operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with
Section 91.119.

14 CFR 91.121: Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating the aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure." As the UAS may not have a
barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed.
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the PIC confirming the altitude of the
launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR 91.151(a): Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

Section 91.151(a) outlines fuel requirements for beginning a flight in VFR conditions.
Relief from Section 91.151(a)(1) is requested to the extent required to allow flights of a
variety of UAS during daylight hours in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions to continue
until 90 percent of remaining battery power or fuel reserves remain. Measure seeks the
requested relief because without an exemption from Section 91.151(a)(1), the flight time
duration of the selected aircraft will be reduced and severely constrain the practicality of
any aerial acquisition of data that Measure proposes to conduct pursuant to this Petition.

The technical specifications of the proposed UAS, their Operations Manuals, and

selected aircraft during daylight hours in VFR conditions until 90 percent of remaining
battery power or fuel reserves remain.

14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b): Carrying civil aircraft certification and registration

The UAS has no cabin, cockpit or pilot station and is operated without an onboard pilot.
Therefore, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or
to display them on the UAS. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping
these documents at the ground control point where the pilot flying the UAS will have
immediate access to them, to the extent they are applicable to the UAS.

14 CFR 91.405(a); 407(a)(1); 409(a)(2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections,
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as
prescribed in part 43 of this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in
compliance with Part 43.

Given that these sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to Measure. Maintenance will be accomplished
pursuant to the User Guide or Operating Manual. An equivalent level of safety will be
achieved because these UASs are limited in size and will carry a small payload and
operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise, the
UAS can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL. The
PIC will ensure that the UAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform
required maintenance and keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the PIC
is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an
airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

PUBLIC INTEREST

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of UASs for aerial acquisition
of data enhances safety while reducing risk. Manned aircraft in certain application such
as pipeline monitoring create a greater risk because the aircraft are much larger and carry
an onboard human pilot. In contrast, a UAS weighing 55 pounds or less will carry no
passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks associated with
manned aircraft flights. In addition, additional streams of aerial data will allow large
commercial entities to make decisions about how to best deploy ground resources and
ensure the safety and cost-effectiveness of their operations.

EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Measure proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate within the limitations listed herein. These limitations
provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the
current and proposed regulatory structure.

PRIVACY

All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's
prior consent and knowledge. Images or video taken of individuals will have consented to
being filmed or otherwise they will be made anonymous.

NATIONAL SECURITY

Given the small size of the UAS involved and the restricted environment within which
they will operate, our petition presents no national security issue.

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (herein
referred to as FMRA) and 14 CFR Part 11, Measure, a 32 Advisors Company, LLC
(herein referred to as Measure) hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal
Aviation Regulations (FARs) to allow commercial operation of UAS for the acquisition
of aerial data, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions
outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA.

As detailed in this document and the attached Appendix of UAS, the requested exemption
would permit the operation of UAS platforms previously approved by the FAA for
commercial operations in the United States. Approval of this exemption would thereby
enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's responsibilities to "...establish
requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace
system." Section 333(c) Reform Act.

AUTHORITY FOR EXEMPTIONS

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under §40101
of the Act, including UAS, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current
airworthiness certificate.

The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed
under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections §44702-44716 of this title if the
Administrator finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 USC §44701(f). See also 49
USC §44711(a); 49 USC §44704; 14 CFR 91.203(a)(1).

Section 333(b) of the Reform Act assists the Secretary in determining whether UAS may
operate in the national airspace system without creating a hazard to the user, the public,
or a threat to national security. In making this determination, the Secretary must consider:

    · The UAS' size, weight, speed and operational capability;
    · Whether the UAS operates within the visual line of sight of the operator;
    · Whether the UAS operates outside of highly populated areas and away from close

         proximity to airports.

Reform Act 333(a). If the Secretary determines that a UAS "may operate safely in the
national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation
of such aircraft in the national airspace system." Id. 333(c).

BACKGROUND ON MEASURE

Measure is one of the world's leading Drone as a Service® companies. Measure provides
turnkey solutions utilizing UAS to deliver specific, low risk, and cost effective actionable
data to clients. Measure was founded specifically to help clients avoid the capital expense
and operating risks of establishing their own drone programs and to purchase drone
support in a way which better fits their operations and cost profiles.

Measure believes in a risk-based and technology agnostic approach to operations in the
national airspace. Approval for any operation should be based on an analysis of the
specific risks associated with the fully integrated solution, rather than the individual
components.

The Measure business model is predicated on identifying requirements, developing the
business case, and demonstrating the Return on Investment (ROI) from UAS for
enterprise clients in a number of industries. Drone as a Service® is a custom integrated
solution made up of seven different components.

UAS AND OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION

Measure seeks to commercially operate a variety of UAS weighing less than 55 pounds
including payload in the United States for the purpose of acquiring aerial data. The
Appendix attached to this exemption petition lists the aircraft that Measure contemplates
operating. In prior, similar exemptions the Secretary has approved every UAS platform
included in the Appendix.

As the operator of these aircraft, Measure is committed to the following conditions and
limitations on its operations. Measure understands that failure to comply will be grounds
for the immediate suspension or rescission any exemption granted.

    1. Operations are limited to the UAS listed in the Appendix when weighing less than
         55 pounds including payload.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not contemplated.

    3. The aircraft will not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per
         hour). In no case will the aircraft be operated at airspeeds greater than the
         maximum aircraft operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.

   3  
                                                
    4. The aircraft will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground

         level (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The aircraft will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot in
         Command (PIC) at all times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision
         unaided by any device other than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's U.S.
         driver's license.

    6. All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO). The aircraft will be operated
         within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times.

    7. All operating documents needed to operate the UAS and will be accessible during
         UAS operations and made available to the Administrator upon request. The
         operator will also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for
         extension or amendment.

    8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
         operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component,
         will undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations.

    9. Measure is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
         in a condition for safe operation.

    10. Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
         UAS is in a condition for safe flight.

    11. Measure will follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul, replacement,
         inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft components.

    12. Each UAS operated under this exemption will comply with all manufacturer
         safety bulletins.

    13. The PIC will hold a UAS flight training certificate, in some cases training directly
         from the aircraft manufacturer, and a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a state,
         the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
         government.

    14. Measure will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
         ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will
         be operated to acquire aerial data, including evasive and emergency maneuvers
         and maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and
         structures. PIC qualification flight hours and currency will be logged in a manner
         consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Measure will operate flights for the purposes

   4  
                                                
         of training Measure PICs and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-
         building) and determining the PIC's ability to safely operate the UAS.

    15. UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1.
         All operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

    16. The aircraft will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point
         (ARP) as denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for
         airports not denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on
         the current FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with
         that airport's management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA.

    17. The aircraft will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
         horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
         PIC.

    18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the aircraft will return
         to a pre-determined location.

    19. The PIC will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

    20. The PIC will be prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and
         forecast weather conditions) there is enough available power or fuel for the
         aircraft to conduct the intended operation and to operate after that for at least five
         minutes or with the reserve power or fuel recommended by the manufacturer if
         greater.

    21. All operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA if the
         blanket COA does not cover the intended operation.

    22. All aircraft operated will be identified by serial number, registered in accordance
         with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification   (N-Number) markings in
         accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as
         practicable.

    23. Documents used by Measure to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS
         and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 will be available
         to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is
         operating.

    24. The aircraft will remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
         activities at all times.

   5  
                                                
    25. The UAS may be operated by the PIC from a moving device or vehicle; however,

         specific requests will be made via subsequent COA.
    26. All flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating

         persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
         a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating
         persons from the aircraft or debris in the event of an accident; or
         b. The owner/controller/operator of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
         permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made an
         assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it
         does not present an undue hazard.
    27. The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons will not be considered
         nonparticipating persons under this exemption.
    28. All operations conducted over private or controlled-access property will be
         conducted with the permission from the property owner/controller or authorized
         representative. Permission from property owner/controller or authorized
         representative will be obtained for each flight to be conducted.
    29. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
         boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA will be
         reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours.
         Accidents must be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
         per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness certificates

Subpart H, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of airworthiness
certificates as required by FAR §91.203(a)(1). Given the size and limited operating area
associated with the aircraft to be utilized by Measure, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart
H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333
of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 USC §44701(f)) and Section 333 of the
Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an
airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational
capability and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UAS. In all
cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the UAS operated without an
airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed,
will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

14 CFR 45.23(b): Marking of the aircraft

This regulation requires that certain experimental, provisionally certified aircraft, or light-
sport category aircraft to be marked with letters between 2 inches and 6 inches high
"limited", "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," near each entrance
to a cabin, cockpit or pilot station. Even though the UAS will have no airworthiness
certificate, an exemption may be needed as the UAS will have no entrance to the cabin,
cockpit or pilot station on which the word "Experimental" can be placed. Given the size
of the UAS, 2 inch lettering may be impossible. Measure will mark the UAS as
practicable.

14 CFR 61.113(a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command

Sections 61.113(a) and (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the
UAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the
equivalent level of safety of current operations by requiring the pilot operating the
aircraft to have completed a UAS flight-training course. Unlike a conventional aircraft
that carries the pilot and passengers, the UAS is remotely controlled. The area of
operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in
advance. The risks associated with the operation of the UAS are so diminished from the
level of risk associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when
drafted, that allowing operations of the UAS as requested exceeds the present level of
safety achieved by 14 CFR 61.113(a) and (b).

   7  
                                                

14 CFR 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft Measure
contemplates operating, should this exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard
will exist for determining airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft and the operational
restrictions put on the aircraft, an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

14 CFR 91.9(b)(2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking and placard requirements

The UAS, given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight
manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no
room or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft. The equivalent level of safety will
be maintained by keeping the Operating Manuals at the ground control point where the
pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to it.

14 CFR 91.103: Preflight action

This regulation requires each pilot in command take certain actions before flight to
ensure the safety of flight. An exemption is needed from this requirement, as the pilot
will take separate preflight actions, including checking for weather conditions, checking
flight battery or fuel requirements, checking takeoff and landing distances, and all other
actions in the Operating Manual and safety checklists. These actions will provide an
equivalent level of safety.

14 CFR 91.109: Flight instruction

Section 91.103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free
balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning
dual controls. By design, UAS do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control is
accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft via
radio communications. The equivalent level of safety is provided by the fact that neither a
pilot nor passengers will be carried in the aircraft, the ability to control the UAS via radio
signals from the controller and by the size and speed of the aircraft.

14 CFR 91.119: Minimum safe altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. The UAS will
never operate at altitude higher than 400 AGL and all operations will occur during
daylight hours under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) only.

   8  
                                                
The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight and speed of the
UAS as well as the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the
permission of the property owner. Because advance notice to the property owner and any
onsite personnel, as well as the precautions outlined below, all affected individuals will
be aware of the planned flight operations.

Flight operations will be conducted at least 500 feet from all non-participating persons
(persons other than the pilot in command (PIC) or visual observer (VO)), vessels,
vehicles and structures, unless operations do not present an undue hazard.

The UAS will remain within visual line of sight of the PIC or VO. Flight operations will
be conducted at least 5 miles from an airport. The PIC or VO will provide notification to
the local Flight Standards District Office and airport controller of all operations within 5
miles of an airport. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations through the filing
of notices-to-airmen.

Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than the UAS
proposed herein, any risk associated with our operations is far less than those presently
presented with helicopters and other conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 feet
AGL. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the UAS will ensure separation between
these UAS operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with
Section 91.119.

14 CFR 91.121: Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating the aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure." As the UAS may not have a
barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed.
An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the PIC confirming the altitude of the
launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR 91.151(a): Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

Section 91.151(a) outlines fuel requirements for beginning a flight in VFR conditions.
Relief from Section 91.151(a)(1) is requested to the extent required to allow flights of a
variety of UAS during daylight hours in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions to continue
until 90 percent of remaining battery power or fuel reserves remain. Measure seeks the
requested relief because without an exemption from Section 91.151(a)(1), the flight time
duration of the selected aircraft will be reduced and severely constrain the practicality of
any aerial acquisition of data that Measure proposes to conduct pursuant to this Petition.

   9  
                                                
The technical specifications of the proposed UAS, their Operations Manuals, and
Measure's proposed operating limitations, ensure that Measure will safely operate the
selected aircraft during daylight hours in VFR conditions until 90 percent of remaining
battery power or fuel reserves remain.

14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b): Carrying civil aircraft certification and registration

The UAS has no cabin, cockpit or pilot station and is operated without an onboard pilot.
Therefore, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or
to display them on the UAS. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping
these documents at the ground control point where the pilot flying the UAS will have
immediate access to them, to the extent they are applicable to the UAS.

14 CFR 91.405(a); 407(a)(1); 409(a)(2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections,
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as
prescribed in part 43 of this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in
compliance with Part 43.

Given that these sections and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to Measure. Maintenance will be accomplished
pursuant to the User Guide or Operating Manual. An equivalent level of safety will be
achieved because these UASs are limited in size and will carry a small payload and
operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise, the
UAS can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL. The
PIC will ensure that the UAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform
required maintenance and keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the PIC
is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an
airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

PUBLIC INTEREST

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of UASs for aerial acquisition
of data enhances safety while reducing risk. Manned aircraft in certain application such
as pipeline monitoring create a greater risk because the aircraft are much larger and carry
an onboard human pilot. In contrast, a UAS weighing 55 pounds or less will carry no
passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks associated with
manned aircraft flights. In addition, additional streams of aerial data will allow large
commercial entities to make decisions about how to best deploy ground resources and
ensure the safety and cost-effectiveness of their operations.

   10  
                                                

EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

Measure proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate within the limitations listed herein. These limitations
provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the
current and proposed regulatory structure.

PRIVACY

All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's
prior consent and knowledge. Images or video taken of individuals will have consented to
being filmed or otherwise they will be made anonymous.
