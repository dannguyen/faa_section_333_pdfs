                     Exemption No. 11363A
                     Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0114

Mr. David Ho
8312 Callista Drive
Frankfort, IL 60423

Dear Mr. Ho:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 11, 2015 you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add DJI Inspire I.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
                                                                                                 2

Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11363
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11363 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 and
    DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
    Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
    amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

           3. The extent of relief you seek, and the reason you seek relief:

   David Ho, respectfully submits this request in harmony with the Reform Act, 112 P.L. 95 §§ 3:3 I-:331·, pursuing reprieve
  fhlm any currently applicable FARs operating to preclude me, David Ho intended use is saleable aerial cinematography in
  video or still format within the Greater Chicago region to provide information f(x intended parties that enhances real estate
  listings or any legal business that provide supplementary tool adding a greater degree of flexibility which supplements the
  present abilities obtainable by manned aircraft inside the national airspace system.

  The Reform Act in Section 332 provides for such incorporation of civil unmanned aircraft systems into our national airspace
  system as it is in the public's interest to do so. David Ho's, DJI Inspire I model no. T600 (Serial #W130CA2302091·7)
  (camera Serial #w18DBL300II:H9) (Repeater serial WaoCA15030320) quad-copter small UNMANNED AIRCRAFT
  SYSTEMS (UAS), meets the definition of "small unmanned aircraft" as defined in Section :331 and therefore the integration
  of my ultra-light weight UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) is expressly considered by the Reform Act. David
  Ho would like to operate my DJI Inspire 1 ultra-light weight UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS), prior to the time
  period, by which the Ref(Jrm Act requires the FAA to broadcast rules governing such craft. The Ref(Jrm Act guides the
  Secretary in defining the types of UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s that may operate safely in our national

                                                                                                                                             1

 airspace system. Considerations include: The weight, size, speed and overall capabilities of the UNMANNED AIRCRAFT
 SYSTEMS (UAS)'s; whether the UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) will be operated near airports or heavily
 populated areas; and, Whether the UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) will be operated by line of sight. My DJI
 Inspire 1 1 model no. T600 (Serial #W130CA2302091·7) (camet·a Serial #wiSDBL3001134·9) (Repeater serial
 Wl40CA 15030320) UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) operates four ('l·) cotmter-rotating propellers for stability,
 control and steadiness. My UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) is equipped with GPS and auto return safety
 technology. Weighing less than flve (6) pounds far below the maximttm 55 pound limit); including camera with gimbal.

Operation of the UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) preceding flight and post flight must be operated in a check
list format and that safety is paramount with each flight. My DJI Inspire 1 model no. T600 (Serial #W130CA2302094·7) (camera
Serial #w18DBL30011fl1·9) (Repeater serial W11·0CA15030320) is designed to hover in place via GPS and operate in less
than a 1·5 knots. David Ho operates this UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) with in mind that safety, stability and
fear of detrimental financial loss, I will not fly in winds exceeding 13 knots (15 mph). Built in safety systems include a GPS
mode that allows my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) to hover in place when radio controls are released.
This is the safest, most dependable and unwavering mode to prevent accident and hazard. When pilot communication is lost
UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) is designed to slowly descend to point of origination, the UNMANNED
AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) has a function that instantaneously video records once communication is lost. I do not and will
not operate my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) near airports, Hospitals or helipads, and do not operate near
areas where general public is one hundred (100) yards depending on location, conditions and weather. David Ho is constantly
vigilant on alert f(Jr any manned aircraft and prepared either avoid and shall yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and operate
in a manner to avoid any type of collision hazard with respect to persons on the ground or property and to land/terminate
instant! y to the nearby and safest ground point should a manned aircraft approach my location or suspect manned aircraft may
approach near my location, My DJI Inspire 1 model no. T600 (Serial #W130CA2302094·7) (camet·a Serial
#w 18DBL300 11349) (Repeater serial W l1·0CA 15030320) UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) is capable of vertical
and horizontal operations, and are flown only within my line of sight of me. As the Remote controlled pilot The
UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) is operation under the power of a battery power rather than combustible fuels,
flights generally last between ten (10) to 15 minutes, with an altitude under 200 hunclred (200) feet, conducted during
daytime, visual flight rules (VFR) condition and within visual line of sight (VLOS) ofme, and I will follow FAA guidelines of
operation 5 NM fi·om an airport having an operational control tower , 3 NM from an airport with a published
instrument flight procedure, but not an operational tower or 2NM from an airport without a published
instrument flight procedure or a operational tower or 2 Nm from a heliport with an instrument flight
procedure.

            4. How Request Will Benefit the Public As A Whole:

In-flight videography for topographical awareness and real estate marketing or any legal business utilizing aerial photographs
or video has been around for an extensive period of time done with manned fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. For the small
budget businessperson the expense of such aerial Videography is enormously fee and cost prohibitive. Depriving, many others of
the smaller businessperson from exploiting a valuable advertising tool. Manned aircraft exposes a superior hazard to the public
through conceivable cataclysmic crash causing loss to property and or life. UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) pose
no such hazards due its size, speed and nonexistence of flammable fuel significantly reduces any potential threat to the public.

5. Reasons Why Exemption Will Not Adversely Affect Safety or How the Exemption Will Provide a Level of Safety At
Least Equal To Existing Rule:

David Ho's safety protocols will enhance safety; exemption will not adversely affect safety.
In addition I, submit the following representations of enhancements to current aerial videography and photography for real estate
or any legal business requiring photographic images:

              David Ho's operating procedures exceeding extstmg rules. First, the possible loss of life is lessened because
  UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s carry no pilots or passengers on board and I only operate my UNMANNED
  AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) safely in the direct detailed areas of operation versus fixed wing or helicopter requires travel
  to the region of need. Second, there is no fuel on board an UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) and thus the
  probability for tire or explosions is significantly diminished. Lastley, the small size and extremely maneuverability of my
   UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) allow me to remotely pilot away fl·om hazards quickly and safely.

6. A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:

      14 C.F.R. 21 and 11· C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and the Like.

          11- C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for procurement of necessary

        airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.20.3(a)( 1). The size, weight and enclosed operational area of my, David

         Ho's, UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) permits exemption fi·om Part 21 because my UNMANNED
         AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) meets (and exceeds) an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section s.~s of the
         Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft fi·om the airworthiness certificate requirement under both the
        Act (1·9 U.S.C. § 14-70 I (f)) and Section .333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces oflegislation permit the FAA to exempt
         UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s fi·om the airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the
         weight, size, speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense populations. My, David Ho's,
         current and projected UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s meet or exceed each of the details.

          14 C.F.R. 91. 7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. As no such certificate
         will be applicable in the form contemplated by the FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable.

         11· C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft Hight manual in the aircraft. As there are no on board pilots or passengers,

          and given the size ofthe UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s, this Regulation is inapplicable. An equivalent
          level of safety will be achieved by maintaining safety/flight manual delineating areas of where safety can be
          defined.(See Enclosed) The FAA has previously issued exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737,
          8738,9299, 92il9A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10lfi7A, 10G02, 10700 and:J2827.

         11- C.F.R. § 91.121 regarding altimeter settings is inapplicable insofar as my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS
          (UAS) utilizes electronic global positioning systems with a barometric sensor.
         11· C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b) provides for the carrying of civil aircraft certif!cations and registrations. They are
          inapplicable for the same reasons described above. The equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining any
          such required certifications and registrations by me, David Ho.
      1'1 C.F.R. § 1·5.2:3: Marking of the Aircraft.

                Applicable Codes of Federal Regulation require aircraft to be marked according to certain specifications. My
                 UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) are, by definition, unmanned. They therefore do not have a cabin,

                                                                                                                                             4

               cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or phrases. Further, two-inch letterin)S is difl'icult to place
               on such small aircraft with dimensions smaller that minimal lettering requirement. Regardless, I will mark its
               UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)s in the largest possible lettering by placing the word
               "EXPERIMENTAL" on its fuselage as required by 11- C.F.R.

               §1·5.29 (f) so that I the pilot, or anyone assisting me as a spotter with the UAV will see the markings. The FAA
               has previously issued exemptions to this regulation through Exemptions Nos. 8738, 10167, 10 1G7A and\0700.

     14 C.F.R. § Gl.l13: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: PIC.
               Pursuant to 11· C.F.R. §§ 61.113 (a) & (b), private pilots are limited to non-commercial operations. I, David Ho,
               can achieve an equivalent level of safety as achieved by current Regulations because my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT
               SYSTEMS (UAS) does not carry any pilots or passengers. Further, while helpful, a pilot license will not ensure
               remote control piloting skills. The risks attended to the operation of my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS
               (UAS) is far less than the risk levels inherent in the commercial activities outlined in H· C.F.R. § G1, et seq.
               Thus, allowing me, David Ho, to operate my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) meet and exceed
               current safety levels in relation to H C.F.R. §G 1.113 (a) & (b).

     11- C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

               11· C.F.R. § 91.119 prescribes safe altitudes for the operation of civil aircraft. It allows helicopters to be operated
               at lower altitudes in certain conditions. My UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) will never operate at
               an altitude gt·eater than 200 ABOVE GROUND LEVEL; safely below the standard of 1·00 ABOVE GROUND
               LEVEL. I, David Ho, will however operate my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) in safe areas away
               fi·om public and trafflc, providing a level of safety at least equivalent to or below those in relation to minimum safe
               altitudes. Given the size, weight, maneuverability and speed of my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS),
               an equivalent or higher level of safety will be achieved.

   11· C.F.R. 91.1·05 (a); 1·07 (a)(!); 1·ml (a) (2); 1·17(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections.

     The above-cited Regulations require, amongst other things, aircraft owners and operators to "have [the] aircraft inspected
     as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this
     section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 1·3 of this chapter. ..."

     These Regulations only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. They will not, therefore, apply to my, David Ho's,
     UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS). However, as a safeguard I inspect my UNMANNED AIRCRAFT
     SYSTEMS (UAS) beforehand and afterward each flight.

      Summary the FAA May Publish in the Federal Register: A. 11· C.F.R. 21 and 14
     C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and the Like. 11- C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates,
     sets f(Jrth requirements tor procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR§ 91.203(a)( 1). The size,
     weight and enclosed operational area ofmy UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) permit exemption fl·om Part 21
     because my, David Ho's, UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) meets an equivalent level of safety pursuant to
     Section 3.~~3 of the Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft ti·om the airworthiness certificate requirement
     under both the Act (4·9 U.S.C. § '1-4701 (t)) and Section 33.~ of the Reform Act. Both pieces oflegislation permit the FAA to
     exempt UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s fi·om the airworthiness certificate t·equirement in consideration of
     the weight, size, speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense populations. My UNMANNED
     AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS) meets or exceeds each of the elements. 14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft
     without an airworthiness certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the FARs, this
     Regulation is inapplicable. 11·

Exemption Request f(x David Ho Pursuant To Section 3 3 3 of the FAA Reform Act of 20 12, March 23, 2015 "Blanket
"Request.

    C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no pilots or passengers, and given the size
    of the UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)'s, this Regulation is inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be
    achieved by maintaining a manual. The FAA has previously issued exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607,
    8737, 8738, 9299, 929>JA, 9565, 9565B, 10167, maintenance program that involves regular software updates and curative
    measures for any damaged hardware. Therefore, an equivalent level of safety will be achieved.

             7. There is no request to exercise the privileges ofyour exemption outside the United States.
