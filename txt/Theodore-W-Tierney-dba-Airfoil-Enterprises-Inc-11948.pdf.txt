                                                           Exemption No. 11948
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1349

Mr. Theodore W. Tierney
d/b/a Airfoil Enterprises, Inc.
165 West Islip Road
West Islip, NY 11795

Dear Mr. Tierney:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 17, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Airfoil Enterprises, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct land surveying
and mapping services in New York and Hawaii.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Airfoil Enterprises, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Airfoil Enterprises, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
    weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported

FAA private pilot certificate #3036030
New York State driver license #961104163

The requested exemption would authorize Airfoil Enterprises Inc.(AFT) to perform
commercial operations that would enhance its existing Surveying and Mapping services,
including but not limited to imaging for Precision Agriculture applications, Digital Terrain
Modeling, Infrastructure reconnaissance and inventory with GIS applications for Private, Local,
State and Federal entities.

These services will be augmented by use of either or all of the following:

           The Inspire 1, quad electric motor UAS manufactured by DJI Inc.

The requested exemption would authorize commercial operations using the UAS for land
survey applications. These operations will be subject to strict operating and conditions defined
by the UAS manufacturer's standards and procedures in order to ensure at least an equivalent
level of safety to currently authorized operations using manned aircrafts.

Upon receipt of the exemption contemplated herein, AFI shall, if required, obtain a Certificate
of Waiver or Authorization (COA) form the FAA Air Traffic Organization prior to conducting
operation(s) in the NAS.

Further, the professional services to be augmented by the uses contemplated herein are, by law,
performed under the supervision of a Registered Land Surveyor whom, by virtue of his or her
experience and licensing, technical knowledge of GPS, plane geometry, trigonometry and
spherical geometry along with a full understanding of the rights of all owners of property both
above and below its limits, inherently and uniquely make AFI a particularly well suited entity
for the safe and efficient commercial use of UAS. In fact, certain aspects of the contemplated
services using UAS are regulated by State Law and Regulation promulgating the licensing of
 land surveyors and land assessors.

 By this petition, AF I seeks an exemption that will authorize it to use the DJI Inspire for
 commercial purposes provided its operators comply with any terms and conditions of
 the FAAs anticipated grant of exemption, including the procedures and requirements set forth in
 the respective manufacturer's user manuals. AFI requests the FAA treat the DJI Inspire user
 manual as proprietary under 14 C.F.R. 11.35(b) and not include such documents in the public
 docket. These manuals are, by reference, incorporated herein and are part of existing Petitions for
 Exemption under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation
 Regulations, identified as follows:
    Docket ID:FAA-2015-0133
· Petition of: DJI Inc., for an exemption from portions of 14 C.F.R. Part 21;
· Document Type: Other
· Document Subtype: Petition(s)

    Status: Posted
· Received Date: January 3 0, 20 15

    Under the requested exemption, AFI as operator of the DJI Inspire will ensure that the aircraft
     will be operated by an individual who has completed the UAS manufacturer's training program for
     operation of the UAS.

          1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AIRCRAFT

     The DJI Inspire is a small and ultra-light platform that perform precision aerial mapping and
     photography missions using onboard GPS and related proprietary flight management software
     that allows the operator to plan safely and efficiently a mission in 3D, and then monitor it in real
     time. An camera attached via a vibration dampening gimbal takes a collection of high-definition
     still images that are used later to generate photographs, maps and contour lines of the surveyed
     area.

     The four main characteristics of the UAS are:

     a. Very light weight

      The low kinetic energy significantly reduces the risk of hazardous situations. U AS i s
     equipped with an optical flow sensor that accurately and reliably senses
     the crafts proximity to the ground and objects on the ground, like
     persons, and will maintain hover to avoid potential collisions.
b. Electric-powered

The UAS is electric-powered. 4 brushless engine technology makes quiet and reliable. The
propellers easily flex away in case of contact with any object.

c. Semi-automatic flight

The artificial intelligence incorporated within the UAS autopilot system continuously analyzes
data from the Inertial Measurement Unit and from the onboard GPS and takes care of all the
aspects of the flight under the supervision of the operator.

d. Option for Manual control

Additionally, the UAS provide an override capability that allows the operator to take manually
initiate autonomous actions during the flight such as "return home", "land" or, "hold and resume
the mission". The operator can also suspend automated operations and take manual control ofthe
aircraft should it become necessary to respond emergency circumstances, thanks to the remote
controller provided with the system.

2.APPLICATIONSAND ADDED VALUE OF THE UAS

Mapping applications may include agricultural applications, mining, construction and survey/
GIS operations. There are many operational benefits related to the use of this solution:

a. The UAS bring safety to daily survey operations: there is no need for the humans to
access dangerous working areas anymore (mines, quarries, or polluted sites). The missions can
be programmed and reproduced reliably as often as needed for regularly updated maps.

b. The UAS is a cost-effective solution. It is cheaper to operate a UAS rather than an
aircraft or other ground systems for the same results. Moreover, small UAS like the DJI Inspire
can help Ag businesses and farmers face the growing needs of the population while reducing
operational costs and environmental impact of launching full scale aircraft into the the air to perfonn
the same work while consuming dozens of gallons of fuel per hour and releasing excess green house
 gasses into our atmosphere. This UAS will also enable offer the ability to take up new challenges -
 like water or environmental management through analysis of vegetation index maps.

 c. Users can save time and work more efficiently by using a UAS. A mission does not need a long
 preparation time or long deployment constraints, or long waiting time for perfect weather
 conditions unlike, for example, the use of satellites. Initial results are accessible directly on-site,
 which is impossible with images provided by satellites or manned aircrafts.

 d. Lastly, but possibly most importantly, is the efficiency aspects of these systems in the
 development, production and maintenance of the infrastructure related to the national energy issues
 that are being played out in the extraction of tight oil reserves in various parts of the United States.

 3. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD UNDER SECTION 333
a. Airworthiness assessment

DJI Inspire has demonstrated it s respective airworthiness through many and varied national
international projects, involving state/federal agencies or universities (among others the New
Mexico State University: https://newscenter.nmsu.edu/Articles/viewll 0208/nmsu-uas-flightiest
center-conducts-dji-airworthiness-assessment, and the US Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE")
New Orleans, who coordinated with the Department of Army and the FAA to obtain all
authorizations required in order to operate the Inspire 1 UAS). Moreover, D JI has obtained
flight approvals for the DJI Inspire from the national civil aviation authority in many countries,
including:

          Switzerland (flight approval for Visual Line of Sight "VLOS" operations)
          Canada (flight approval for VLOS operations)
         Australia (flight approval for VLOS operations)
         France (flight approval for Extended-VLOS operations)
          Germany (flight approval for VLOS operations)
          United Kingdom (flight approval for VLOS operations)
         Norway (flight approval for VLOS operations)
          Sweden (flight approval for VLOS operations)
     - . Denmark (flight approval for VLOS operations)

b. Operating Conditions

Grant of the exemption to AFI will be subject to the following operating conditions, the
operator proposed the following conditions and/or limitations, which were accepted by the
FAA.
1. The UAV will weigh less than 55 lbs. Fully loaded with battery the total operational
    weight of the DJI Inspire is 6.25lbs as per official specifications published by the
    manufacturer DJI Inc .. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require an
    amendment to the grant of exemption contemplated herein.

2. Flights will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of a Pilot in Command (PIC)
    and/or Visual Observer (VO).

3. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 30 minutes. Flights will be
    terminated at 25% battery power reserve should that occur prior to the 30 minute limit.

4. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.

5. The UAS will only operate within a confined, preprogrammed survey area.

6. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UAS operations prior to each day's
     flight mission. Itwill be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties within
     the boundaries of the safety perimeter be present for this briefing.

7. Pilot and observer will have been trained in operation ofUAS generally and received up
     to-date information on the particular UAS to be operated as required in the respective the
     Manuals. The operator's manual will be maintained and made available to the
     Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations
     of an exemption and the procedures outlined in the operator's manual, the conditions and
     limitations herein take precedence and must be followed. Otherwise, the operator must
     follow the procedures as outlined in its operator's manual. The operator
     may update or revise its operator's manual. It is the operator's responsibility to track such
     revisions and present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request.
     The operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for
     extension or amendment. If the operator determines that any update or revision would
     affect the basis for which the FAA granted this exemption, then the operator must
     petition for amendment to their exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80)
     may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the operator's manual.

8. PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate by voice and/or text.

9. Written and/or oral permission from the relevant property holders will be obtained.
10. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county or
    city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate
    governmental agencies.

11. If the UAS looses communications or looses its GPS signal, the UAS will have capability to
    return to a pre-determined location within the Survey Area and land.

12. The UAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case ofunpredicted obstacles or
    emergencies.

13. Prior to each flight the PIC must inspect the UAS to ensure it is in a condition for safe
    flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the
    aircraft is prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed
    and the UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight. The Ground Control Station, if
    utilized, must be included in the preflight inspection. All maintenance and alterations must
    be properly documented in the aircraft records.

14. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or
    flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo a
    functional test flight in accordance with the operator's manual. The PIC who conducts the
    functional test flight must make an entry in the UAS aircraft records of the flight. The
    requirements and procedures for a functional test flight and aircraft record entry must be
    added to the operator's manual.

15. The operator must follow the manufacturer's UAS aircraft/component, maintenance,
    overhaul; replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements. When unavailable, aircraft
    maintenance/component/overhaul, replacement, and inspection/maintenance
    requirements must be established and identified in the operator's manual. At a minimum, the
    following must be included in the operator's manual:

    a. Actuators I Servos
    b. Transmission (single rotor)
     c. Powerplant (motors)
     d. Propellers
     e. Electronic speed controller
     f. Batteries
     g. Mechanical dynamic components (single rotor)
     h. Remote command and Ground
     control station
    j. Any other components as determined by the operator
II

                     16. If planned operations occur within 2 miles of Commercial Services Airport as defined by
                          the FAA, the operator must obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate
                          of Waiver or Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations. This COA will
                          also require the operator to request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours
                          in advance, but not less than 48 hours prior to the operation. Additionally, factory installed
                          prevent the DJI Inspire from operating within a one mile radius of an airport.

                      17. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
                          number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N
                          Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be as
                          large as practicable.

                      18. The operator must develop procedures to document and maintain a record of the UAS
                          maintenance, preventative maintenance, alterations, status of replacement/overhaul
                          component parts, and the total time in service of the UAS. The preflight inspection must
                          account for all discrepancies, i.e. inoperable components, items, or equipment, not
                          covered in the relevant preflight inspection sections of the operator's manual.

                      19. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer Safety
                          Bulletins.

                     20. Before conducting operations, the radio frequency spectrum used for operation and
                          control of the UAS must comply with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or
                          other appropriate government oversight agency requirements.

                      21. The UAV must remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned operations
                           and activities at all times (including, but not limited to, ultralight vehicles, parachute
                           activities, parasailing activities, hang gliders, etc.).

                      22. UAV operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
                           operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
                           under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

                      23. The UAS cannot be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

                      24. The UAS may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet horizontally
                           from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

                      25. The UAS may not operate in Class B, C, or D airspace without written approval from the
                           FAA. The UAS may not operate within 5 nautical miles of the geographic center of a non
                           towered airport as denoted on a current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless a letter
                           of agreement with that airport's management is obtained, and the operation is conducted
                           in accordance with a NOTAM as required by the operator's COA. The letter of agreement
                           with the airport management must be made available to the Administrator upon request.
    26. Any 1) incident, 2) accident, or 3) flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
         boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported to
         the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24
         hours. Accidents must be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per
         instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov. Further flight
         operations may not be conducted until the incident, accident, or transgression is reviewed
         by AFS-80 and authorization to resume operations is provided.

With this petition intended that AFI will be able to provide safe, reliable and accurate land
surveying services and information to its clients with the use of the latest innovative technology
associated with remotely piloted aircraft.
Your attention to this matter is appreciated.
Respectfully submitted,

                                                              ANNEXA

 EXEMPTION REQUEST AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY SHOWINGS
UNDER APPLICABLE RULES SUBJECT TO EXEMPTION

AFI requests an exemption from the following regulations as well as any additional regulations
that may technically apply to the operation of the OJ I Inspire UAS:

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 CFR § 91.203

Section 91.203 requires all civil aircraft to have a certificate of airworthiness. Part 21, Subpart H,
entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance of
airworthiness certificates as required by FAR§ 91.203(a). Given the size of the UAV, their very
light weight and the limited operating area associated with its utilization, it is unnecessary to go
through the certificate of airworthiness process under Part 21 Subpart H in order to achieve or
exceed current safety levels.

Such an exemption meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and
Section 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act and Section 333 of the Reform Act both
authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon
consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and
populated areas of the UAS involved. An analysis of these different criteria demonstrates that
the UAS operated without an airworthiness certificate, under the conditions proposed in that
exemption, will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate.

14 C.F.R. § 45.23 & 14 C.F.R. § 45.29: Display of marks; size of marks

These regulations provide that each aircraft must display "N" and the aircraft's registration
number in letters at least 3 inches high. Additionally, the aircraft must display the word
"EXPERIMENTAL" in letters at least 2 inches high near the entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or
pilot station. Given the size of the UAS, this requirement is impossible to match.

14. CFR §61.23: Medical certificates: Requirement and duration

 Regulations provide that a person:

 (1) Must hold a first-class medical certificate:

 · When exercising the pilot-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate;
 · When exercising the second-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate in
 a flag or supplemental operation in part 121 of this chapter that requires three or more pilots; or
 · When serving as a required pilot flight crew member in an operation conducted under part
 121 of this chapter if the pilot has reached his or her 60th birthday.

 (2) Must hold at least a second class medical certificate when exercising:

  ·Second-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate in part 121 of this
 chapter (other than operations specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section); or
 · Privileges of a commercial pilot certificate
Given the size of the UAS, their structure, the limited flight area, and the safety features
integrated in the autopilot (among others a flight termination system), A F I believes that an
Equivalent Level of Safety can be reached if the operator has a valid driver's license.

14 C.F.R. §61.3: Requirements for certificates, ratings and authorizations

14 C.F.R. §61.113(a} & (b); 61.133(a}: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations; Pilot in

Command; Commercial Pilot Privileges and Limitations

The regulation provides that no person may serve as a required pilot flight crew member of a
civil aircraft of the United States, unless that person:

(1) Has a pilot certificate or special purpose pilot authorization issued under this part in that
person's physical possession or readily accessible in the aircraft when exercising the privileges of
that pilot certificate or authorization. However, when the aircraft is operated within a foreign
country, a pilot license issued by that country may be used. The regulation provides also that no
person that holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft for
compensation or hire. Subparagraph (b) allows a private pilot to act as pilot in command of an
aircraft in connection with any business or employment if:

(1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment;

(2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire.

Given the safety features of the UAS and the fact that the missions are pre-programmed and
monitored in real-time with a specific flight management software, A F I proposes that operators
of the UAS should not be required to hold a commercial or private pilot certification. Instead,
operators should be required to:

· Have completed the UAS manufacturers training program for operation of the UAS. The
manufacturer's training program for eBee operators has been already satisfactorily reviewed
through the Application for Airworthiness Qualification Level (AQL) 3 Airworthiness Release
(AWR). The equivalent level of safety will be achieved by having an operator trained UAVs
manufacturer, and using the integrated features of the aircraft to maintain a high level of safety
during the different missions.

14 C.F.R. §91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for the
issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1 ). Given the size and
limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by the Applicant, an exemption
from Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11
and Section 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.§44701 (f)) and Section
333 of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an
airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability,
and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UAS. In all cases, an analysis of
these criteria demonstrates that the UAS operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the
restricted environment and under the conditions proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a
conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness certificate without
the restrictions and conditions proposed.

 14 C.F.R. §91.9: Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements
The equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping a hard copy of the user manual in
In close proximity to the operator.

The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the UAS marked on its fuselage as
required by §45.29 (f)where the pilot, observer and others working with the sUAV will see the
identification of the UAS as "Experimental." The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this
regulation to Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

14 C.F.R. §91.109(a): Flightlnstruction

The regulation provides that "No person may operate a civil aircraft that is being used for flight
instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls."

The equivalent level of safety during the in-flight training will be achieved by the manufacturer or
affiliate providing the training as described in the manufacturer's training program and through
the use of experienced and qualified instructors familiar with the UAS.

14 CFR §91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. The exemption requests
authority to operate at altitudes up to 400 AGL, It will however be operated in a restricted area
with security perimeter, where buildings and people will not be exposed to operations without
their pre-obtained consent

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the UAS as well
as the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the permission of the property
owner or local officials.

 Compared to flight operations with aircraft weighing far more than those proposed herein and
the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less than those
presently presented with conventional aircraft.

14 CFR 91.121: Altimetersettings

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set" ...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the UAS may not have a barometric altimeter,
but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption is requested.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator confirming the altitude of the
launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 C.F.R. §91.151 (a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

The regulation provides that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under day-VFR
conditions unless there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and to fly after
that for at least 30 minutes. As the UAS are electric-powered, this requirement is inapplicable. In
any event, given the contemplated operations, A F I believes that an equivalent level of
safety is already achieved with the specific procedure preventing the UAS accepting a take-off
order is the battery level is below a given value. Moreover, the manufacturers have integrated
low and critical battery level warnings and implemented a "return to home" action in these
situations.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) & (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration

This regulation provides as follows:

· No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has an appropriate and current airworthiness
certificate.

· No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is
displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground control
point where the pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to them, to the extent they are
applicable to such UAS. The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A
representative sample of other exceptions includes Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A,
9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

14 CFR Subpart E (91.401 - 91.417): Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, and
Alterations

The regulation provides that the operator is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft in
an airworthy condition, including compliance with Parts 39 and 43. Paragraphs 91 A07 and
91.409 require the aircraft to be "approved for return to service by a person authorized under
43.7" after maintenance and inspection. Section 91.409 requires an annual inspection for the
issuance of an airworthiness certificate. Section 91 A17 requires the owner or operator to keep
records showing certain maintenance work that has been accomplished by certificated
mechanics, under Part 43, or licensed pilots and records of approval of the aircraft for return to
service.

AFI proposes that the maintenance of the UAS will be accomplished by the owner or the
operator according to the manufacturers user manual

Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, these
sections will not apply to the applicant Maintenance will be accomplished by the operator pursuant
to the flight manual and operating handbook as referenced herein. An equivalent level of safety
will be achieved because these small UAS are very limited in size and will carry a small payload
and operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise the UAS
can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL. The operator will
ensure that the UAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform required maintenance, and
keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the operator is the person most familiar with
the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the
equivalent level of safety.
