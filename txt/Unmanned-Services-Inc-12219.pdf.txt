                                                           Exemption No. 12219
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1997

Mr. Manfred M. Marotta
Unmanned Services Inc.
314 South Main Street
Suite 1
Versailles, KY 40383

Dear Mr. Marotta:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 17, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Unmanned Services Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
surveying, mapping, and data collection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2 Vision +, and DJI
S1000.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                 2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Unmanned Services Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Unmanned Services Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
    DJI Phantom 2 Vision +, and DJI S1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds including
    payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
    petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities

Regulatory Basis for Exemption Request

This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section 333(a)
through (c) of the Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether
certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before
completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this
determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of UA do not create a hazard to users of
the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security in light of the following:

    · The UA's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
    · Operation of the UA in close proximity to airports and populated areas
    · Operation of the UA within visual line of sight of the operator.

The aircraft intended for use by the operator includes the DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ (Plus)
& DJI S1000. All of these aircraft have previously been approved by the FAA in other applicant's
Section 333 exemptions. Exemptions Nos. 11278, 11275, 11267, 11260, 11253 and 11230.

Reform Act § 333 (a). Lastly, if the Secretary determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the
national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
in the national airspace system." Id. §333(c) (emphasis added).

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This statutory
authority by its terms includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under §40101 of the Act,
which includes UA, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a current airworthiness
certificate.

The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed under
subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of this title if the Administrator finds the
exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. §44701(f) See also 49 USC §44711(a); 49 USC §44704; 14
CFR §91.203 (a) (1).

Unmanned Services Inc.'s UA are rotorcraft, weighting 55 or fewer pounds including payload. The UA
operate under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 50 knots and have the capability to hover and
move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously. The UA will be operated only in line of sight
and will be operated only within a predetermined and protected flight area under the permission of the
property representative. The UA will be operated under the below listed limitations and conditions to
which the operator agrees to be bound when conducting commercial operations under an FAA issued
exemption, as well as any other limitations the FAA may place on future operations. Such operations will
insure that the UA will "not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public as per
the Reform Act Section 333 (b).

Given the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal
Aviation Act, as amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and
the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental impacts, including
reduced emissions associated with allowing UA for aerial data collection, the grant of the requested
exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly, the applicant respectfully requests that the FAA grant
the requested exemption without delay.

The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in material respects to those presented
in this petition. In Exemptions Nos. 11280, 11279, 11278, 11275, 11273, 11271, 11269, 11267, 11260,
11253, 11250, 11230, 11213, 11112, 11109
Aircraft and Equivalent Level of Safety

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements
for the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1). The Federal Aviation
Act (49 U.S.C.§44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft
from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed,
operational capability, and proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UA. In all cases, an
analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the UA operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the
restricted environment and under the conditions proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a
conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness certificate without the
restrictions and conditions proposed.

The UA to be operated hereunder are rotorcraft weighing less than 55 pounds including payload, carries
neither a pilot nor passenger. Carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates
exclusively within visual line of sight of the pilot in command (PIC) and a visual observer (VO). They
operate at a speed of less than 50 knots and have the capability to hover and move in the vertical and
horizontal plane simultaneously within a predetermined and protected flight area as described below.
Such operations will insure that the UASs will not create a hazard to the users of the national airspace
system. Unlike other civil aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and
monitored by both the operator and under the requirements and in compliance with local public safety
requirements, to provide security for the area of operation. The FAA will have advance notice of all
operations. These safety enhancements provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property
owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.F.R.
Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat
to national security posed by the UA, due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack of
explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial external load.

The Secretary of Transportation has previously determined that these aircraft meets the conditions of
Section 333. Therefore, the FAA has found that request of relief from 14 CFR part 21, and any associated
noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is not necessary. This has been stated in
exemptions to this regulation in Exemptions Nos. 11280, 11279, 11278, 11275, 11273, 11271, 11269,
11267, 11260, 11253, 11250 and 11230

The applicant proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to aircraft that have the characteristics
and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at least an equivalent or
even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory structure.

These limitations and conditions to which the operator agrees to be bound when conducting commercial
operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

         1. The UA; DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom Vision+ and DJI S1000+ will weigh less than 55
              pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
              petition or a petition to amend the exemption.

         2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are not
              permitted.

         3. The UA will not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
              exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine compliance
    with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at airspeeds greater
    than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.
4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level (AGL).
    Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.
5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times. This
    requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than corrective
    lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or U.S. driver's
    license
6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within the
    visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used to satisfy
    the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability. The VO and
    PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times; electronic messaging or texting is not
    permitted during flight operations. The PIC must be designated before the flight and cannot
    transfer his or her designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO
    can perform the duties required of the VO.
7. The exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its operations in
    accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in the grant of exemption, are
    hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating documents must be
    accessible during UAS operations and made available to the Administrator upon request. If a
    discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in the exemption and the
    procedures outlined in the operating documents, the conditions and limitations therein take
    precedence and must be followed. Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as
    outlined in its operating documents. The operator may update or revise its operating
    documents. It is the operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and
    revised documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension or
    amendment to the grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or revision
    would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted the exemption, then the operator must
    petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office
    (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the operating
    documents.
8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or
    flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo a
    functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption. Functional
    test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at least 500 feet from
    other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such a manner so as to not pose
    an undue hazard to persons and property.
9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is in a
    condition for safe operation.
10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the UAS is in
    a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all potential
    discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the inspection reveals a
    condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is prohibited from operating
    until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the UAS is found to be in a
    condition for safe flight.
11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul, replacement,
    inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft components.
12. Each UAS operated under the exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety bulletins.
13. A PIC must hold either an airline transport, commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot

    certificate. The PIC must also hold a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S.
    driver's license issued by a state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a
    possession, or the Federal government. The PIC must also meet the flight review
    requirements specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her
    pilot certificate.
14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated under this
    exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and maintaining appropriate
    distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC qualification flight hours and
    currency must be logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the
    purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-
    building) and determining the PIC's ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent
    with how the UAS will be operated under this exemption are permitted under the terms of the
    exemption. However, training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training
    sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not
    essential for flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the
    UA with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.
15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights under
    special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.
16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not denoted with
    an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-published
    aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's management is obtained or
    otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption holder. The letter of agreement with
    the airport management must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.
17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet horizontally
    from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    predetermined location within the private or controlled-access property.
19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.
20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather
    conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the intended operation and
    to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve power recommended by the
    manufacturer if greater.
21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The exemption
    holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct operations that cannot
    be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
22. All aircraft operated in accordance with the exemption must be identified by serial number,
    registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N- 6 Number)
    markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be as large as
    practicable.
         23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and any
              documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the PIC at the
              Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These documents must
              be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

         24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and activities at all
              times.

         25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.
         26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating persons,

              vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
              a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from

                   the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure that
                   nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where
                   nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of the UA, flight
                   operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of nonparticipating
                   persons; and
              b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission for
                   operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of the risk of
                   operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not present an undue hazard.
              The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered nonparticipating
              persons under the exemption.
         27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with permission
              from the property owner/controller or authorized representative. Permission from property
              owner/controller or authorized representative will be obtained for each flight to be conducted.
         28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical boundaries
              of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported to the FAA's UAS
              Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be reported to the National
              Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site:
              www.ntsb.gov.

Unless otherwise specified in the grant of exemption, the UAS, the UAS PIC, and the UAS operations
must comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45, 47, 61, and 91.

14 CFR § 61.23 (a) & (c): Medical certificates: Requirements and duration.

This regulation sets forth medical certificate requirements for pilots-in-command of aircraft in that a
holder must have a first-class medical certificate when exercising the PIC privileges of an airline transport
pilot certificate. Furthermore, the requirement states that the PIC must hold at least a second-class
medical certificate when exercising PIC privileges of a commercial pilot certificate, or must hold at least
a third-class medical certificate when exercising PIC privileges of a private pilot certificate, recreational
pilot certificate, or flight instructor certificate. It also states that a person must hold and possess either a
medical certificate issued under § 61.67 or a U.S. driver's license when exercising the privileges of a PIC
of a sport pilot certificate in a light-sport aircraft other than a glider or balloon.

The FAA is granting relief from § 61.23(a) to allow any pilot that holds one of the pilot's certificates
(discussed above) to operate a UAS with a U.S. issued driver's license, in lieu of an FAA-issued medical
certificate. The FAA is also granting relief from § 61.23(c) to allow sport pilot certificate holders to
operate aircraft other than LSA with a U.S. issued driver's license. The FAA has issued the following
exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos.11278, 11275, 11269, 11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252,
11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 61.101 (e) (4) & (5): Recreational pilot privileges and limitations.

This section limits recreational pilots to non-commercial operations and that they may not act as pilot in
command of a recreational aircraft for compensation or hire, or in the furtherance of a business. Unlike a
conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the UA is remotely controlled with no living
thing on board. The area of operation will be predetermined and in a protected flight area under the
permission of the property representative, and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance. The
FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos.11278, 11275, 11269,
11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252, 11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 61.113 (a): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command.

This section limits private pilots to non-commercial operations and that they may not act as pilot in
command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire. Unlike a
conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the UA is remotely controlled with no living
thing on board. The area of operation will be predetermined and in a protected flight area under the
permission of the property representative, and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance. The
FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos.11278, 11275, 11269,
11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252, 11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 61.315 (a): What are the privileges and limits of my sport pilot certificate?

This section limits sport pilots to non-commercial operations and that they may not act as pilot in
command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire, or in the
furtherance of a business. They also may not carry more than one passenger, fly at night, and under other
restrictions that are outside of the scope of intended flights of the UA. Unlike a conventional aircraft that
carries the pilot and passengers, the UA is remotely controlled with no living thing on board. The area of
operation will be predetermined and in a protected flight area under the permission of the property
representative, and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance. The FAA has issued the following
exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos.11278, 11275, 11269, 11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252,
11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition. As
there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this exemption be granted, no FAA
regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft for maintenance
and use of preflight actions as prescribed by the aircraft's manufacturer prior to each flight, and given the
FAA's prior approval of the same types of aircraft to be used in previous exemptions to this requirement
(as set forth in Exemptions Nos. 11278, 11275, 11267, 11260, 11253 and 11230) we believe we can
maintain a high standard of safety and due regard as to the aircraft's airworthiness during flight
operations. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos.11278,
11275, 11269, 11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252, 11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 91.119 (c): Minimum safe altitudes.

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119 (d) allows
helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person operating the
helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the FAA. As this exemption
is for UAS that are rotorcraft and the exemption requests authority to operate at altitudes up to 400 feet
AGL, an exemption may be needed to allow such operations. As set forth herein, the UA will never
operate at higher than 400 feet AGL, will always be operated under VLOS of both the PIC and VO, its
area of operation will be predetermined and in a protected flight area under the permission of the property
representative, all flights are planned and coordinated in advance and the UA will remain clear of, and
give way to all manned aviation operations and activities at all times.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the UA as well as the
location where it is operated and under the conditions previously stated. Compared to flight operations
with aircraft or rotorcraft weighting far more than the maximum 55pounds proposed herein and the lack
of flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less than those presently presented with
conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 feet AGL. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the
UA will ensure separation between these small- UAS operations and the operations of conventional
aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this
regulation: Exemptions Nos. 11278, 11275, 11269, 11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252, 11240 and
11230.

14 CFR § 91.121: Altimeter Settings.

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by reference to an
altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate altimeter setting available
before departure." As the UA may not have a barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an
exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the
manufacturer's published procedures and live flight data monitoring, confirming the altitude of the launch
site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight. In the event that the GPS altitude read out system
becomes none functional during flight, the UA will also have a pre-programmed maximum flight limit of
400 feet programmed into them so that they may not fly above unapproved altitude limits. The FAA has
issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemptions Nos. 11278, 11275, 11269, 11267, 11260,
11256, 11253, 11252, 11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 91.151(a) (1): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions.

Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions
unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of
intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least
30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes."
The LiPo battery powering the DJI Phantom 2 & DJI Phantom Vision + UA provides approximately 20
minutes of powered flight while the LiPo battery powering the DJI S1000 provides approximately 30
minutes of flight. The PIC will not begin a flight unless there is enough available power for the UA to
conduct the intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve power
recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

Applicant believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) falls within the scope of prior exemptions,
and that flight with less than 30 minutes of reserve fuel, does not engender the type of risks that Section
91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed of the small UAS. Similar exemptions have
been granted to other operations, including Exemptions Nos. 11278, 11275, 11269, 11267, 11260, 11256,
11253, 11252, 11240 and 11230.

14 CFR § 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (1) & (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections.

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as provided in
paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter...," and
others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43. Given that these sections and Part
43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, these sections will not apply to the applicant.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because these small UASs are very limited in size and will
carry a small payload and operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues
arise the UA can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL and within
VLOS of the PIC and VO. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and
determine the UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all potential
discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the inspection reveals a condition that
affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is prohibited from operating until the necessary
maintenance has been performed and the UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight. The operator
must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul, replacement, inspection, and life limit
requirements for the aircraft and aircraft components. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to
this regulation: Exemptions Nos. 11278, 11275, 11269, 11267, 11260, 11256, 11253, 11252, 11240 and
11230.

Privacy

All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property representative or
owner's prior consent and knowledge. Filming will be of people who have also consented to being filmed
or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where filming will take place.

All flights will occur in accordance with any state or local laws regarding privacy.

Additional Views, Information & Summary

USI senior management collectively have 26 years of experience in unmanned aircraft flight operations.
Past performance include conducting flight operations support services to Military, Academia and the
Defense Aerospace industry flying rotorcraft, fixed-wing and lighter than air (LTA) aircraft of sizes from
2 pounds up to 3,000 pounds at take-off. We have flown large UA from an international airport with other
commercial aircraft, so we make safety paramount, but we also know that integrating and operating in
congested airspace along with manned aircraft is possible without incident. Senior Management alone
have safely conducted over 9,100 flight hours, incident free.

Unmanned Services Inc. (USI) was established January, 2011 and is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned
Small Business. Experienced personnel include: Internal & External Pilots, Mission Commanders, Sensor
Operators, Maintenance Technicians, Program Managers, Logisticians, Tech Writers and Engineers. All
of these personnel have had formal training from universities, military schools and/or have received
training from the aircraft and system manufacturers themselves. This demonstrates that our personnel
take their profession and safety serious and are not laypersons much like informally trained R/C (remote
controlled) pilots.

As a public benefit Unmanned Services Inc. will advance:

-Research into future safety guidelines for the use of UAS,

-Reduction in dangers by limiting the use of larger rotorcraft or fixed-wing aircraft,

-Reducing carbon emissions, &

-Advancement of science through advanced data collection

*********

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal Register,
should it be determined that publication is needed:

Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:

14 CFR 61.23(a) & (c); 14 CFR 61.101 (e) (4) & (5); 14 CFR 61.113 (a); 14 CFR 61.315 (a); 14 CFR
91.7 (a); 14 CFR 91.119 (c); 14 CFR 91.121; 14 CFR 91.151 (a) (1); 14 CFR 91.405 (a); 14 CFR
91.407 (a) (1); 14 CFR 91.409 (a) (1) & (2) and 14 CFR 91.417 (a) & (b) to operate commercially a
small unmanned vehicle (55pounds or less) for the purpose of aerial surveying, mapping and data
collection; remote sensing; educational and research operations; wildlife and forestry monitoring; aid in
disaster and emergency management and monitoring, civil first response, communications relay, search
and rescue, monitoring fire hazards, cleanup effort supervision, damage assessment and estimation; aid
civil engineering: waterways and shipping, forestry, fishery protection, pollution control and air sampling
and crop performance; railroad and motor-vehicle road inspection; telecommunications infrastructure
inspection; utility, energy systems and electrical engineering inspections and asset management;
agricultural surveying and produce field management; livestock management and accountability;
unmanned aircraft flight school; aerial filmmaking and photography; construction site inspections and
monitoring; oil and gas pipeline inspection/patrolling and oil-field inspection; real estate and marketing;
aerial event security, surveillance and crowd management and aerial imagery evidence for property
insurance claims.

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of UA in the listed industries will enhance
safety by reducing risk. Conventional flight operations using jet, piston or multi-engine powered aircraft
occasionally operate at extremely low altitudes to complete some of the requested uses and in extreme
proximity to people and structures. This presents associated risks as these vehicles weigh in excess of
3,000 pounds and carry large amounts of jet A or other fuel. Such aircraft must fly to and from the
mission location. In contrast, a UA weighing fewer than 55 pounds, powered by batteries, virtually
eliminates all of the above risks given the UA's reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on
board. The UA is carried to the mission site. The UA will carry no passengers or crew, therefore, the UA
will not expose them to the risks associated with manned aircraft flights.

The operation of small UASs, weighting less than 55 pounds, conducted in the strict conditions outlined
above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exemptions requested herein,
including exempting the applicant from the requirements of Part 21 and allowing commercial operations.
These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to the ground but under 400 feet AGL, and within
visual line of sight of the pilot in command and a visual observer. As a result, the small UASs are far
safer than conventional flight operations conducted with large manned aircraft.

Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012--size, weight, speed,
operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas, operation within visual line of sight,
national security and the significant public benefit as well as the positive economic impacts ­ provide
more than adequate justification for the grant of the requested exemptions allowing commercial operation
of applicant's UA. Granting Unmanned Services Inc. the above exemptions will allow for the expansion
of UAS systems into the future, in a professional, safety conscious culture steeped in the tradition of
Aviation. Unmanned Services Inc. respectfully requests that the FAA grant its exception without delay.
The FAA has the authority to issue the exemption sought by Unmanned Services Inc. pursuant to the
Federal Aviation Act, 85 P.L. 726 (1958), as amended (the "Act").

Sincerely,

Manfred M. Marotta

Unmanned Services Inc, President
