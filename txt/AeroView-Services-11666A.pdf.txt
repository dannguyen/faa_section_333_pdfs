                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0630

Sperry, Iowa 52650

Dear Mr. Murguia:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letters dated June 12, 2015 , and June 25, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of AeroView Services, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or
operator) for an amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and
(c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add the 2015 SenseFly eXom and Trimble UX5
hp.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                  2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11666
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11666 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Trimble UX5,
         SenseFly eXom, and Trimble UX5 hp when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Re: Re: Docket FAA 2015-0630, Petition for Amendment to Exemption No. 11666

 Dear Mr. Williams:

AeroView Services, LLC received FAA Exemption No. 11666 on May 22, 2015 authorizing
AeroView Services, LLC under section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of
2012 to operate an unmanned aircraft system ("UAS"), the Trimble Navigation UX5, for
various commercial purposes. In this present petition for an amendment to Exemption No.
11666, AeroView Services, LLC seeks to operate the sensefly eXom UAS for the same
purposes.

The eXom, weighting 3.7 pounds (Maximum Take Off Weight), contains a rich array of
advanced integrated sensors. These sensors work together to provide the user with full
situational awareness and support obstacle avoidance:
· Five 'Navcam ' vision sensors allow the operator to see in the direction the drone is
moving via its flight control software, without needing to tum the system's TripleView
A

vVlv

camera head. This technology is w1ique in such a lightweight UAS, similar to the visual
parking sensors in modem cars, but brought into a 3D flight environment.

· Five ultrasonic proximity sensors work in hannony with eXom's Navcams to ensure
the operator always knows the drone's distance from nearby objects. (The drone's shock
absorbent carbon fiber shrouding is also always on hand to protect its rotors in case of
surface contact.)

· Numerous other sensors, including inertial measurement units, barometers,
magnetometers, GPS and magnetic encoders, maximize the drone 's stability and safety.

eXom offers different flight modes to suit every project: semi-automatic mode (waypoint
navigation) or interactive ScreenFly mode (using the supplied joypad to navigate and
orientale the drone via computer screen). The Screenfly mode includes flight assistance
features such as cruise control and distance lock. In any situation, RC-based manual control
always remains available as a backup function.

The eXom is particularly safe. It was developed with flexible material absorbing potential
shocks, and senseFly's R&D team has developed also a unique carbon-fiber shrouding
protecting the propellers. SenseFly has also added also redundancy in the command and
control system. In case something happens to the primary autopilot, the eXom will switch
automatically to the secondary autopilot.

AeroVicw Services, LLC will comply with all ofthe conditions and limitations imposed in
Exemption 11666 except that condition/limitation number 1 will need to be revised to

include the senseFly eXom UAS. The list of "operating documents" will. also need to be

revised to include the senseFly operating manual and safety assessment for the eXom UAS.
Other than these revisions, there will be no change in the conditions and reasons relative to
public safety that were the basis for the initial grant of exemption.

 Supporting documents listed as exhibits one through five were emailed to
 333exemptions@faa.gov on 6- 12- 15. SenseFly has requested that the proprietary
 inf01mation in exhibits one through five remain confidential in our amendment submission.
 Because the requested amendment would not set any new precedent or otherwise raise any
 novel issue, and because AeroView Services, LLC seeks to begin these operations without
 delay, AeroView Services, LLC respectfully requests the FAA to determine that good cause
 exists to dispense with publication of the summary of this petition in the Federal Register
 and grant the requested amendment expeditiously by summary means.
Thank you for your consideration of this petition.

Re: Re: Docket FAA 2015-0630, Petition for Amendment to Exemption No. 11666

Dear Mr. Williams:

AeroView Services, LLC received FAA Exemption No. 11666 on May 22, 2015
authorizing AeroView Services, LLC (AeroView) under section 333 of the FAA
Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 to operate an unmanned aircraft system
("UAS"), the Trimble Navigation UX5, for various commercial purposes. In this
present petition for an amendment to Exemption No. 11666, AeroView seeks to
operate the Trimble UX5 hp UAS for the same purposes.

The requested amendment to add the UX5 hp to exemption 11666 is consistent with
amendment 11110A granted to Trimble Navigation to include the UX5 hp. See
exemption 11110A (May 7, 2015; docket FAA-2014-0367).

The UX5 hp, has a minimal weight and power increase to allow for an increase in
payload. This allows the UX5 hp to carry a slightly larger camera. The larger
camera will provide higher resolution for the finished survey product. The power
increase will allow for better performance in high altitude areas of the country and
flexibility to increase payload in the future. The physical dimensions and operating
characteristics of the UX5 hp are the same as the UX5 model approved in exemption
11666.

AeroView Services, LLC will comply with all of the conditions and limitations
imposed in Exemption 11666 except that condition/limitation number one wilJ need
to be revised to include the Trimble UX5 hp UAS. Other than this revision, there
will be no change in the conditions and reasons relative to public safety that were the
basis for the initial grant of exemption.

Supporting documents listed as exhibits one through five were emailed to
333exemptions@faa.gov on June 25, 2015. Trimble has requested that the
proprietary information in exhibits one through five remain confidential in our
amendment submission. Please note that the UX5 hp has the same operating and
safety characteristics as the UX5 . Exhibits one through four are the same as
submitted in support of exemption 11666. The official documentation has not yet
been updated to include the UX5 hp. Exhibit 5 is the UX5 hp data sheet containing
the updated weight and power specifications. Physical dimensions are the same as
the UXS.

As the requested amendment will not set a new precedent or otherwise raise any
novel issue, AeroView Services, LLC seeks to begin these operations without delay,
AeroView Services, LLC respectfully requests the FAA to determine that good cause
