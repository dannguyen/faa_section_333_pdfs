                                                           Exemption No. 12587
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2302

Dr. Daanen Strachan
Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC
1725 I Street, NW., Suite 300
Washington DC 20006

Dear Dr. Strachan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial public safety inspections and photography of properties, bridges, and
construction sites.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus and Walkera Tali
H500.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC is granted an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a),
91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                               3

aerial data collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed
below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    Vision Plus and Walkera Tali H500 when weighing less than 55 pounds including
    payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
    petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
                                                                                                            4

    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

1 Description of Petitioner

    Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC, a Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) and
    Certified Business Enterprise (CBE) formed in 2009, is a Washington-DC based consulting
    company solving problems through innovative applications and solutions. We are addressing
    customers' needs in construction, engineering, and architecture using industry best practices. We
    are involved in the planning, coordination of various projects including government, residential,
    and commercial projects.

    The Petitioner has launched its drone mapping and inspection service. Our quadcopter and
    hexacopter assets are suitable for various private, industrial, and commercial applications. We
    seek to provide aerial image-thermography, inspections of sites using high resolution video and
    photo cameras, surveys, and 3D image mapping from a point cloud. Aerial technology using
    unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) has been shown to significantly increase productivity and
    reduce the inherent safety risks to property and personnel. The Petitioner has adopted UAS
    technology to increase safety, accuracy, value, construction management, rapid turnaround of
    data, versatility, and its speed as opposed to traditional survey methods.

    Additionally, the Petitioner is staffed with personnel who have UAS operational and
    maintenance experience. This natural transition to the infrastructure and public safety inspection
    market, along with our engineering inspection experience, reduces the overall risk to the public,
    while conducting inspection operations. Therefore, the Petitioner seeks the requested exemptions
    and a Certificate of Authorization to permit it to offer consulting services for the public and
    private sectors to conduct UAS operations for a host of industries and applications. These
    include:

          Aerial building photography and inspections;
          Aerial surveying and inspections;
          Substructure bridge inspections;
          Temporary tower crane assembly verification inspections;
          Construction activities for compliance determination; and
          Aerial inspections in the DC Metropolitan Area

2 Relevant Statutory Authority to Petitioner's Exemption Request

    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s mission is to provide the safest airspace system
    globally. Since the National Airspace System (NAS) isn't static and will constantly be changing,
    it must adapt to new technologies and applications, as evidence by the proliferation of unmanned
    aircraft systems (UAS). Because UAS are inherently different from manned aircraft, introducing
    UAS into the NAS will be challenging. Under Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and
    Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA), the Secretary of Transportation has the authority to grant case-by-
    case authorization for certain unmanned aircraft to perform commercial operations prior to the

Page 6  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    finalization of the small UAS Rule, which will be the primary method for authorizing small UAS
    operations once it is complete (Section 333, 2015).

    The Section 333 Exemption process provides operators who wish to pursue safe and legal entry
    into the NAS a competitive advantage in the UAS marketplace, thus discouraging operations
    which are noncompliant with the implementing regulations and which improves safety.
    Therefore, this Petition is being submitted in accordance with Sections 333 (a) to (c) of the
    FMRA. In this Act, Congress directed the FAA "to safely accelerate the integration of civil
    UASs in the national airspace system", and under Section 333, the FAA Administrator is to
    permit UASs to operate in the NAS where it is safe and does not create a hazard or pose a threat
    to national security to do so based on the following:

          The UAS size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
          Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
          Operation of the UAS within visual line-of-sight of the operator.1

    In addition, the FAA Administrator has the general authority to grant exemptions from FAA
    safety regulations and minimum standards when the Administrator decides a requested
    exemption is in the public interest.2 A party requesting an exemption must explain the reasons
    why the exemption: (1) would benefit the public as a whole and; (2) would not adversely affect
    safety or how it would provide a level of safety at least equal to the existing rules.3

    The Petitioner will use multirotor UAS vehicles, weighing 6 or fewer lbs. including payload and
    operate under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 8.23 meters/sec or 16 knots for aerial
    public safety inspections. Each UAS will have the capability to hover, and move in the vertical
    and horizontal plane simultaneously. In addition, the UASs will operate only in the pilot's visual
    line of sight at all times. As a result, the Petitioner will demonstrate how the proposed UAS
    aerial public safety inspections will benefit the public and that the proposed operations will not
    adversely affect safety of the public and to those operating in the National Airspace System.

3 Qualifications for Approval under Section 333 of the FMRA

    The proposed operations in this petition for exemption, qualify for expedited approval under
    Section 333 of the FMRA. Each of the statutory criteria and other potential relevant factors are
    satisfied. The Petitioner's planned operations would permit the use of small and relatively
    inexpensive UAS under controlled conditions in the Class G airspace that is: (a) limited; (b)
    predetermined; (c) controlled as to access; and (d) would pose an increased level of safety beyond
    what exists when building inspectors, infrastructure inspectors, fixed or rotor wing aircraft are
    used to accomplish the same purpose for inspection of buildings, bridge substructures,
    compliance determinations at construction sites, and crane assembly verifications.

2 49 U.S.C. §44701(f) (authorizing the grant of exemptions from a requirement of regulations prescribed pursuant to Section

44701(a)-(b) and Sections 44702-44716).

May 23, 2015

    The Petitioner's sUASs will operate in visual line-of-sight (VLOS) and in specific safe zone
    areas described in Section 5, Proposed Operations outlined in this Petition. Also, the Petitioner's
    fleet includes both a micro UAS (mUAS, weighing 2.75 lbs.) quadcopter and a small UAS
    (sUAS) hexacopter, weighing less than 6 pounds, including payload. They will operate under
    normal weather conditions, at speeds not to exceed 16 knots and have the capability to hover,
    and move in both vertical and horizontal positions. The proposed operations will be conducted
    with sUAS and or mUAS of a size and weight that will ensure a superior level of safety over
    conducting the same operations with conventional fixed wing, manned aircraft, and reduce the
    inherent safety risks to property and personnel.

    Given the size of the mUAS and sUAS involved and the restricted safety zones in which they
    will operate, this Petition for exemption falls within the zone of safety, in which Congress4
    intended for the FAA to permit commercial UAS operations by exemption, pending completion
    of their formal ruling. Moreover, the authority granted to the FAA by Congress via Section 333
    of the FMRA, provides the equivalent level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and
    the significant benefit to the public, which the grant of the requested exemption is warranted and
    is in the public interest. Therefore, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the FAA grant the
    requested exemption without delay, because such operations will insure that both the mUAS and
    sUAS will not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public.

3.1 DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, Version 3.0 mUAS Asset

    The Petitioner will deploy the DJI Phantom 2 Vision + (NT0050029), version 3.0 for inspection
    of vacant or occupied buildings, compliance activities at construction sites, substructure bridge
    inspections, crane assembly verification inspection, and for general aerial surveys. The Petitioner
    shall use images captured from the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus. These images will be taken
    automatically and are geo-tagged by the Phantom 2 Vision Plus and then the rendering software
    will convert images to maps and 3D models.

    A copy of the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus User Manual, Pilot Training Guide, Prop Guard
    Assembly Guide, Battery Safety Guide, and the ARS Flight Safety and Procedures Manual are
    submitted as supporting documents with this Petition.

    The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ represents the company's flagship consumer model, improving on
    the Phantom 2 Vision by adding a Zenmuse H3-3D gimbal camera system. The Phantom 2
    Vision is only outfitted with a jello-slaying rubber platform to ward off minimal gyration shake,
    while the new Phantom 2 Vision+ corrects for vertical, horizontal, and angular shake. With this
    new system, the onboard camera can be tilted up or down, greatly maximizing the range of the
    lens. DJI also offers the Phantom 2, which comes without a camera or gimbal. The Vision+ can
    transmit video and flight data to a smart phone thru Wi-Fi with almost no latency, the operator
    can actually "Fly" the UAS base on the video screen with First Person View (FPV) experience,
    Wi-Fi range is about 500-700m (Perlman, 2014).

    The Phantom 2 Vision Plus 3.0 or mUAS weighs 2.75 pounds including battery and camera.
    Incorporated into the programming of the mUAS is an automatic return home feature that

Page 8  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    automatically directs the Phantom back to the point of take-off (Home location) should the unit
    lose communications with the transmitter. Also, the mUAS has a crusing speed of 15 knots and
    a maximum speed of 29 knots. Maximum flight time is 25 minutes and has a gross weight of
    2.75 pounds.

    As for the remote controller, it features a sliding power button, left and right joysticks, S2 and
    S1 switches, and a chrome eyelet to mount a neck strap to. There is a movable antenna at the top
    of the controller that can be angled upward, which is recommended by DJI for attaining the best
    signal. The WiFi extender has two LED lights that indicate connection status, as well as the
    power level health. In terms of actually piloting the drone, both the S2 and S1 switches need to
    be flipped up and the WiFi extender needs to be powered on. The S1 switch places the drone in
    calibration mode by flipping it back and forth several times, and the S2 switch will change the
    drone's Home location. The left joystick powers the drone up, down, and turns it left and right.
    The right joystick moves the drone forward, backward, sideways to the left, and sideways to the
    right (Perlman, 2014). In addition, the Phantom has an additional communication link between
    the camera and the mUAS's on a different radio frequency for a smart phone connection.
    Allowing the operator or Pilot in Command (PIC) to monitor battery level, altitude (AGL),
    distance from PIC, camera imagery, and control camera angle.

    The PIC can use the mUAS's internal software to set maximum altitude AGL for each flight,
    allowing for customization of flights to no higher than 100 feet, 200 feet, 300 feet are some
    examples. The 400 feet maximum AGL can be programmed into the UAVs software pre-flight
    to insure compliance with FAA standards. Also, DJI has internal software that regulates the
    height of the mUAS with No-Fly-Zones. These zones include airports worldwide and have been
    divided into two types, A and B. Also, DJI has a flight limitation system that will prevent the
    mUAS from flying in restricted airspace. For example, if the mUAS is within 1.5 miles of an
    airport's restricted zone, the vehicle will not fly.

    Finally, the mUAS has an altitude and radar monitoring function that allows the PIC better
    determination of height, direction of flight and distance from the PIC. Also, the PIC can monitor
    GPS lock status while in flight with green lights on mUAS and has the ability to anticipate loss
    of GPS locking so the PIC can land the UAS as a precaution.

3.2 Tali Carbon H500 sUAS Asset

    Also, the Petitioner will deploy the Tali Carbon H500 Devo F12 E (N554QW) for inspecting
    the substructure of bridges and for general aerial surveys. A copy of the Tali H500 DEVO Quick
    Start Guide, Settings Guide, Bluetooth Datalink Manual, GoPro Manual, and the ARS Flight
    Safety and Procedures Manual are submitted as supporting documents with the Petition.

    The Tali H500 is considered by many to be the best drone in its class in the world. With its
    cutting edge technology combined with reliability and ease of use, the Tali H500 delivers
    excellent performance. It comes with the HD i-Look Plus camera and the mount accepts all
    GoPro cameras. It has first person view meaning that whatever the camera sees will be
    transmitted live to the controller. With a 25-minute flight time and the 10 waypoint GPS function,
    the PIC can tackle substructure bridge inspections. The retractable landing gear and 3D gimbal
    ensure that the camera shots are 100% unobstructed.

    The Tali H500 weighs 4.45 pounds including battery and iLook camera. Incorporated into the
    programming of the sUAS is a "One Key Go Home" feature that returns the sUAS to the home
    location automatically. The Tali's failsafe return to home mode, an advanced return-to-home
    (RTH) protects the aircraft, in case of loss of control signal; whereby the H500 will automatically
    attempt to return to its starting position for a safe landing. With its' new Hyper I Intelligent
    Orientation Control (IOC) function that includes new advanced IOC systems, the H500 can start
    and fly in any orientation completely solving pilot loss of orientation problems. Also, the sUAS
    has a crusing speed of 25 knots and a maximum speed of 47.7 knots. Maximum flight time is
    25 minutes and has a gross weight of 4.6 pounds.

    As for the Devo F12e transmitter, manufactured by Walkera, the unit has 4 slider controls for
    controlling gains, gimbal, pitch, yaw and roll. Also, it has a built-in 5-in-1 video monitor,
    capable of displaying both video and telemetry data from the Tali H500. The F12e controller
    has 5.8 Ghz antenna and can display live data from the built-in screen. Data options include
    temperature, battery power, GPS position, speed, altitude, and distance from starting point. One
    great feature is the low power warning; the radio starts buzzing and vibrating when there is 2
    minutes or less of flight time left on the H500 battery. The battery is a 6S 5400mah Li-Po 22.2V
    battery with built-in charge status monitoring and promoting safe and convenient flight
    operations.

    7. Flights will be operated within visual line-of-sight (VLOS) of a pilot and visual camera
         observer.

    8. Maximum total flight time of each operational flight will be 25 minutes. Both the mUAS
         and sUAS calculates battery reserve in real time, and will return to its ground station with
         at least 20% battery power reserve should that occur prior to 25 minutes limit.

    9. At all times, both the mUAS and sUAS will remain close enough to operator for the
         operator to be capable of seeing the aircraft with vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses.

    10. Both the mUAS and sUAS will not operate over any persons not directly involved in the
         operation.

    11. Flights for both the mUAS and sUAS will occur during daylight-only operations.

    12. During flight operations, both the mUAS and sUAS will yield right-of-way to other
         aircraft, manned or unmanned.

    13. All flight operations will be in Class G Airspace.

    14. mUAS flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL) or no more than 100 feet above a structure being inspected, if that structure exceeds
         400 feet.

    15. sUAS flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 500 feet above ground level
         (AGL) or no more than 100 feet above a structure being inspected, if that structure exceeds
         500 feet.

    16. Flights will be operated at a lateral distance of at least 500 feet from any structure or
         structure or vehicle unless permission has been granted by the owner or controller of the
         property in advance of the flight. Flights will not be conducted within 500 feet of any
         person who is not essential for the conduct of the flight unless that person is in a position
         where they are shielded from the aircraft and any possible debris resulting from an aircraft
         failure. Flight will be terminated if a person/s breaches safety zone.

    17. At a minimum, the crew for each operation will consist of the Pilot, Visual Camera
         Observer, Engineer Inspector, and one or more State or local government inspector.

U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    25. Both the mUAS and sUAS will only operate within a confined "Sterile Area". A sterile
         area is defined as a safety zone surrounding the subject property that has been cleared of all
         individuals or animals that aren't part of the inspection. In addition, the Petitioner shall
         establish a security perimeter for the flight operations area.

    26. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned mUAS and sUAS operations prior to
         each day's missions. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties
         within the boundaries of the safety perimeter be present for this briefing.

         jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire or other appropriate governmental
         agencies.

    30. The Petitioner will make available to the FAA, upon request, both the mUAS and/or sUAS
         for inspection or testing, and any associated documents/records required to be kept under
         the proposed rule.

    31. Report an accident to the FAA within 10 days of any operation that results injury or
         property damage.

    32. If both the mUAS or sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, both assets will
         have the capability to return to a pre-determined location within the operational area and
         land.

    33. All flight operations will only operate in optimal weather conditions with visibility of at
         least 3 miles from control station.

    34. Both the mUAS and sUAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unpredicted
         obstacles or emergencies. The Pilot will then safely terminate mission and gain control of
         UAS and return to a pre-determine location.

    35. The Petitioner will use a blanket 200-foot Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) for
         all flights anywhere in the country except in restricted airspace and other areas such as
         major cities, where the FAA prohibits UAS operations. Moreover, the Petitioner will obtain
         an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued COA for flights above 200 feet prior to
         conducting any operation under this petition of exemption.

4.4 Specific Operational Procedures for Temporary Tower Crane Assembly Verification
       Inspections

     Cranes are carefully designed, tested, and manufactured for safe operation. When used properly
     they can provide safe reliable service to lift or move loads. Because cranes have the ability to
     lift heavy loads to great heights, they also have an increased potential for catastrophic accidents,
     if safe operating practices are not followed (Culver, 1994). Due to significant advances, safety
     professionals, and OSHA compliance officers need to keep abreast of modern crane technology
     and changes in operating procedures to help them recognize problems before potentially unsafe
     conditions lead to accidents that result in injuries and/or fatalities, as well as damage to
     equipment.

     Keeping these factors in mind, the need for a better understanding of crane operations and the
     implementation of appropriate maintenance schedules is evident in preventing accidents. A
     recent study by Don Dickie, a recognized crane authority with the Construction Safety
     Association of Ontario, indicated that although mechanical failures represents only 11 percent
     of the causes of crane accidents, they usually result in major accidents. Studies and analyses of
     crane accidents involving mechanical failure show they are frequently due to a lack of
     preventive maintenance or adequate training and/or experience on the part of the personnel
     involved. Finally, cranes and associated rigging equipment must be inspected regularly to
     identify and existing or potentially unsafe conditions. This preventive maintenance must be
     performed as required by the crane manufacturer and/or the supplier to ensure safe crane
     operation. Below is a detailed summary of operational limitations and conditions, which ensure
     an equivalent or higher level of safety to operations conducted under regulatory guidelines for
     proposed tower crane assembly verification inspections (see Figure 1).

         crane starting with the concrete footing (#11), continuing up the mast (#10 -#7), then
         moving then horizontally to the counter-jib ballast (#1), the counter-jib block (#4), the
         hoisting drum (#5), continuing past the cabin (#6) and jib-trolley (#3) and finally to the
         hook (#2). Then the operator will repeat the flight path backwards in the following order:
         #2, #3, #6, #5, #4, #1, #7-#10, #11, and then land the UAS (see Figure 1).

    7. Report an accident to the OSHA and the State & local government agency requesting the
         inspection within 10 days of any operation that results injury or property damage.

4.5 Specific Operational Procedures for Substructure Bridge Inspections

    The operator will conduct a systematic method to inspect the substructure of the bridge. The
    proposed operations includes inspection of bridge substructures over waterways. The
    substructure supports the superstructure and transmits loads from the superstructure to the
    ground. The substructure generally consists of pier caps, columns and piles. The substructure
    may be constructed of timber, concrete or steel. Timber members are inspected for wood rot,
    crushing, splitting and cracking. Concrete members are inspected for cracking, spalling, and
    hollow areas. Steel members are inspected for paint peeling, corrosion and cracking. In addition,
    the substructure is inspected for evidence of settlement or scour. Settlement is elements of the
    substructure moving downward due to soil conditions. Scour is the undermining of a structure
    due to water flow removing soil, which supports the structure (see Figure 2). Below is a detailed
    summary of operational limitations and conditions, which ensure an equivalent or higher level
    of safety to operations conducted under regulatory guidelines.

5 Regulations from Which Exemption Relief is Requested

    The Petitioner requests an exemption from several interrelated provisions of 14 C.F.R. Parts 21,
    27, 45, 61, 91, and 93 for purposes of conducting the requested operations using both a mUAS
    and sUAS. Listed below are: (1) the specific sections of 14 C.F.R. for which an exemption is
    sought: and (2) the operating procedures and safeguards that the Petitioner has established, which
    will ensure a level of safety equal to or better than the rules from which exemption is sought.5

5.1 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H- Airworthiness Certificates and 14 C.F.R. §
       91.203(a)(1)

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from this provision, which establishes the procedural
    requirements for the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by §91.203(a)(1). Under
    both the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. §44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the FMRA, both
    authorizes the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificate, upon
    consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, and proximity to airports and
    populated areas of the particular UAS. Moreover, given the size and limited operating area
    associated with both the mUAS (4.4 pounds, including payload) and sUAS (6 pounds, including
    payload) to be utilized by the Petitioner, an exemption from Part 2, Subpart H meets the
    requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the FMRA.

    Finally, in all cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that both the mUAS and sUAS
    operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the
    conditions proposed, will be at least as safe as, or safer than, a conventional craft operating with
    an airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions of the proposed UAS
    operations.

    The mUAS, weighing 2.75 pounds and the sUAS weighing less than 6 pounds including payload,
    carry neither a pilot nor passenger and carry no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels,
    and operate exclusively within a secured and sterile area. Unlike other civil aircraft, the proposed
    operations will be controlled and monitored by the pilot, visual camera observer, and inspection
    engineer, pursuant to procedures in Section 4. Moreover, the FAA will have advance notice of
    all operations conducted under this exemption.

    These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in connection with
    existing inspection operations, provide a greater degree of safety to the Petitioner's staff and
    contractors, the public, and property owners than conventional operations conducted with
    airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H. Moreover, application of
    these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security posed by both
    the mUAS and sUAS, due to its size, speed of operation, lack of explosive materials or
    flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial external load.

5 See 14 C.F.R. § 11.81(c) which requires a petition for exemption to include: "the reasons why granting the exemption would not
adversely affect safety, or how the exemption would provide a level of safety at least equal to that provided by the rule from which
you seek exemption."

May 23, 2015

5.2 14 C.F.R. Part 27 Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Rotorcraft

    The procedural requirements for airworthiness certification of normal category rotorcraft is set
    forth in 14 C.F.R. Part 27. To the extent that both the Petitioner's mUAS and sUAS would
    otherwise require certification under Part 27, Petitioner seeks an exemption from Part 27's
    airworthiness standards for the same reasons identified in the exemption request from 14 C.F.R.
    Part 21, Subpart H.

5.3 14 C.F.R. §§ 45.23(b), 45.27(a) and 91.9(c): Aircraft Marking and Identification
       Requirements

    This Petitioner seeks an exemption from the aircraft marking and identification requirements of
    14 C.F.R. §§45.23(b), 45.27(a), and 91.9(c):

         Section 45.23(b), Markings of the Aircraft, states that marks include only the Roman capital
         letter "N" and the registration number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport
         category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must
         also display on the aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, letters
         not less than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the worlds "limited," "restricted," "light-
         sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as applicable.

         Section 45.27(a), Rotorcraft, states each operator of a rotorcraft must display on that
         rotorcraft horizontally on both surfaces of the cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail the marks
         required by §45.23.

         Section 91.9(c), Civil Aircraft Flight Manual, Marking, and Placard Requirements, states
         that no person may operate a U.S. registered civil aircraft unless the aircraft is identified in
         accordance with Part 45 of this Chapter.

    The request of an exemption from §45.23(b) is warranted because both the mUAS and sUAS
    have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station on which the registration number can be
    placed. Moreover, given the size of the UASs, two-inch lettering would be impossible. However,
    the aircraft registration, or "N Number" will be placed on the fuselage in compliance with
    §45.29(f). Moreover, given the nature of the specific relief sought by this exemption request,
    the Petitioner requires relief from the associated marking and identification requirements of
    §45.27(a) and §91.9(c), which would require compliance with §45.23(b).

    The level of safety for exemptions to the aircraft marking and identification requirements of 14
    C.F.R. §§45.23(b), 45.27(a), and 91.9(c) will be provided by having both mUAS and sUAS
    marked on its fuselage as required by §45.29(f) where the Pilot, Visual Camera Observer, and
    Inspection Engineer and others working with the UASs will see the "N Number" identification
    on the aircraft. Additionally, the Petitioner will ensure compliance with any requests of UASs'
    marking by the FAA. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to the aircraft marking
    requirements of §45.23(b): Exemption Nos. 0692, 0816, 8738, 10700, 10167 and 10167A.

5.4 14 C.F.R. § 61.113: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from the private pilot privileges and limitations of 14 C.F.R.
    §61.113 (a) and (b), which states that:

Page 20  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

         (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, no person who
         holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft that is
         carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire; nor may that person, for
         compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft.

         (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft
         in connection with any business or employment if: (1) the flight is only incidental to
         that business or employment; and (2) the aircraft does not carry passengers or property
         for compensation or hire.

    The purpose of Part 61 is to ensure that the skill and competency of any pilot matches the airspace
    in which he or she will be operating, as well as requiring certifications if the private pilot is
    carrying passengers or cargo for hire. In this case, while both the mUAS and sUAS will be
    operated as part of a commercial operation, they carry neither passengers nor cargo. Accordingly,
    the Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) and (b), commercial limitation
    requirement that the flight be incidental to the business to benefit from the exception.

    As set forth in the ARS Flight Safety and Procedures Manual, to ensure an equivalent level of
    safety, any person acting as a pilot in command, must be knowledgeable in the airspace and
    communication issues pertaining to all aircraft operations, but also in the unique aspects of both
    mUAS and sUAS flights. Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers,
    both mUAS and sUAS, are remotely controlled with no living thing or cargo on board.

    The area of operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in
    advance as set forth in Section 4 of this Petition. Furthermore, while helpful, a pilot license will
    not ensure remote control piloting skills, though the Petitioner's pilot vetting and training
    program will ensure the PIC has substantial experience on either the mUAS and/or the sUAS.
    Moreover, private pilot certificate holders will operate either the mUAS or sUAS with the same
    skill level. The risk to the operations of both the mUAS and sUAS are far less than the risks
    levels inherent in the commercial activities within Part 61. As a result, allowing the Petitioner to
    operate its UASs with a private pilot certificates as the PIC will exceed current safety levels in
    relations to 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) and (b). The Petitioner believes that this system will provide
    a high-level of competency and proficiency for its pilots that ensures a level of safety equal to or
    greater than the rules from which this exemption is requested.

5.5 14 C.F.R. §91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.7(a), which requires that a civil aircraft
    be in airworthy condition to be operated. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for
    the both the mUAS and sUAS, should this exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard
    will exist for determining airworthiness.

    The level of safety is maintained and operated in accordance with all specifications and
    requirements identified by the manufacturer. The Petitioner will only operate UASs that have a
    proven track record of reliability and safety. In addition, given that both mUAS and sUAS will
    be operated by the Petitioner under 6 pounds, and no UAS will be flown unless it has been

Page 21  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    maintained and prepared for flight in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements, and
    equivalent level of safety will be provided.

5.6 14 C.F.R. §91.9(b)(2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.9(b)(2), which requires that:

         (b) No person may operate a U.S. registered civil aircraft.

         (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of this
         chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved airplane or
         Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings and placards, or any
         combination thereof.

    The UASs, given their size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight manual
    on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but also because there is no room or
    capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.

    The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the ground
    station or ground control point where the Pilot flying either UAS will have immediate access to
    it. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737,
    8738, 9299, 9565, 10167, 10602, 32827, and 10700.

5.7 14 C.F.R. §91.103: Preflight Action

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.103, which requires a PIC to become
    familiar with specific information before each flight, including information contained in the
    FAA-approved Flight Manual on board the aircraft. In as such, as the FAA approved flight
    manual will not be provided for both the mUAS and sUAS, an exemption is requested.

    An equivalent level of safety will be provided by following the ARS Safety & Procedures
    Manual and flight manual provided by the manufacturer. The PIC will take all required preflight
    actions-including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff distance,
    and aircraft performance data, prior to flight. Both the Manufacturer Flight Manual and ARS
    Flight Safety & Procedures Manual will be located at the ground station with the pilot at all
    times.

5.8 14 C.F.R. §91.109(a): Flight Instruction

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.109(a), which provides that:

         "No person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that is being
         used from flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls."
         Both the mUAS and sUAS piloted aircraft, by their design, do not have functional dual
         controls. Instead, flight control is accomplished through the use of a box that
         communicates with the aircraft via radio communications.

    As a result of the size and speed of both the mUAS and sUAS, an equivalent level of safe training
    can still be performed without dual controls because no pilot or passengers are aboard the UASs,

Page 22  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System

    and all persons will be a safe distance away in the event that the UASs experiences an difficulties
    during flight instruction. The FAA has approved exemptions from flight training without fully
    functional dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction for exemptions
    numbers 5778K and 9862A.

5.9 14 C.F.R. §91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

    The Petitioner requests an exemption from the minimum safe altitude requirements of 14
    C.F.R. §91.119, which prescribes that:

         The minimum safe altitudes under which aircraft may not operate, including 500 feet
         above the surface and away from any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure in non-
         congested areas6.

    Section 91.119(d) allows for a:

         Helicopter to operate at less than those minimum altitudes when it can be operated
         "without hazard to persons or property on the surface," provided that "each person
         operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed
         for helicopters by the FAA."

    As previously stated in Section 5.1, the mUAS flights will be operated at an altitude of no more
    than 400 feet above ground level (AGL) or no more than 100 feet above a structure being
    inspected, if that structure exceeds 400 feet. Also, the sUAS flights will be operated at an altitude
    of no more than 500 feet above ground level (AGL) or no more than 100 feet above a structure
    being inspected, if that structure exceeds 500 feet. Flights will operated at a lateral distance of
    at least 500 feet from any structure or structure or vehicle unless permission has been granted by
    the owner or controller of the property in advance of the flight. Flights will not be conducted
    within 500 feet of any person who is not essential for the conduct of the flight unless that person
    is in a position where they are shielded from the aircraft and any possible debris resulting from
    an aircraft failure. Flight will be terminated if a person breaches the safety zone.

    Moreover, as compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft, weighing far more than 6
    pounds proposed herein and carrying flammable fuel, any risk associated with our operations is
    far less than those presently presented with helicopters and other conventional aircraft operating
    at or below 500 feet AGL. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight,
    and speed of both the mUAS and sUAS, as well as the location where it is operated. Furthermore,
    by operating at such lower altitudes; both the mUAS and sUAS will not interfere with other
    aircraft that are subject to the minimum safe altitude regulations.

5.10 14 C.F.R. §91.121: Altimeter Settings

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.121, which requires that:

    A person operating an aircraft to maintain crusing altitude or flight level by reference to an
    altimeter that is set to the elevation of the departure airport or barometric pressure. An

U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    exemption is required to the extent that both the mUAS and sUAS do not have a barometric
    altimeter, but rather a GPS altitude read out.

    An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by following the procedures set forth in the ARS
    Flight Safety & Procedure Manual. Moreover, as stated in the manual, the operator will confirm
    the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight. Finally, the PIC
    will use the GPS altitude indicator to constantly monitor either the mUAS or the sUAS height,
    thus ensuring operation at safe altitudes.

5.11 14 C.F.R. §91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions
    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.151(a), which requires that:

         (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the
         first point of intended landing and, assuming normal crusing speed.

                  1. During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or
                  2. At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes

    The battery powering both the mUAS and sUAS provides approximately 25 minutes of powered
    flight. An exemption from the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14 C.F.R. §91.151 is therefore
    required.

    An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 18 minutes, or enough battery
    reserve to ensure that the both the mUAS and sUAS land at the ground station with at least 25%
    of battery power (as determined by the onboard monitoring system and pilot), whichever happens
    first. This restriction would be more than adequate to return both the mUAS and sUAS to its
    planned landing zone from anywhere within its limited operating area.

5.12 14 C.F.R. §91.203(a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration
    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §91.203 (a) and (b) which requires that:

         (b) Except as provided in §91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it
         has within it the following: (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate.

         (c) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate
         required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under
         §91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers
         or crew.

    The Petitioner's UASs, fully loaded weigh no more than 6 pounds and are operated without an
    onboard pilot. Therefore, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration
    documents or to display them on both the mUAS and sUAS.

    The equivalent level of safety will be achieved and sustained by keeping these documents at the
    ground station or flight control point where the pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access

    to them at the ground station or control point. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to
    this regulation: Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

5.13 14 C.F.R. §§91.405(a); 407(a)(1); 409(a)(s); 417(a)(b): Maintenance Inspections

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from the maintenance inspection requirements of 14 C.F.R.
    §§91.405(a); 407(a)(1); 409(a)(s); 417(a) and (b). These regulations specify that the:

         Maintenance and inspection standards in reference to 14 C.F.R. Part 43. As a result,
         an exemption to these regulations is needed because Part 43 and the stated sections
         apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, which both the mUAS and sUAS
         will not have.

    An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because maintenance and inspections will be
    performed in accordance with the UAS Manufacturer Manuals, shown in the Supporting
    Documents Section. Also, the Pilot will ensure that the mUAS or sUAS are in working order
    prior to initiating flight, perform the required maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance
    performed. The Pilot is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the
    aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

    Also, given that both the mUAS and sUAS are very limited in size and will carry a small payload
    and operate only in restricted or sterile areas for limited periods of time during daylight hours,
    creates less risk than that associated with conventional rotorcraft performing the same operation.

5.14 14 C.F.R. Subchapter F, Part 93-Special Air Traffic Rules, Subpart V-Washington,
       DC Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules, §93.333: Failure to Comply with this
       Subpart

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from knowingly violating 14 C.F.R. §93.333(b). This
    regulation states that:

         The DC FRZ and DC SFRA were established for reasons of national security under the
         provisions of 49 U.S.C. 40103(b)(3). Areas established by the FAA under that authority
         constitute "national defense airspace" as that term is used in 49 U.S.C. 46307. In
         addition to being subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, persons who
         knowingly or willfully violate national defense airspace established pursuant to 49
         U.S.C. 40103(b)(3) may be subject to criminal prosecution.

    The Petitioner's PIC will operate its UASs with a private pilot certificate only in the Class G
    airspace. The Petitioner believes that operating in the Class G airspace and providing the
    Washington Flight Standards District Office with an equivalent level of means to identify, track
    (locate), and communicate with the operator during flight operations provides the necessary
    approval to knowingly operating in the DC FRZ and DC SFRA. Moreover, given the nature of
    the specific relief sought by this exemption request, the Petitioner requires relief from 14 C.F.R.
    §93.333(b).

5.15 14 C.F.R. Subchapter F, Part 93-Special Air Traffic Rules, Subpart V-Washington,
       DC Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules, §93.339 (a) through (e): Requirements
       for Operating in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §93.339 (a) through (e) which states that:

         (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in §93.345, or
             unless authorized by Air Traffic Control, no pilot may operate an aircraft,
             including an ultralight vehicle or any civil aircraft or public aircraft, in the DC
             SFRA, including the DC FRZ, unless--
                  1) The aircraft is equipped with an operable two-way radio capable of
                      communicating with Air Traffic Control on appropriate radio frequencies;
                  2) Before operating an aircraft in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ, the
                      pilot establishes two-way radio communications with the appropriate Air
                      Traffic Control facility and maintains such communications while
                      operating the aircraft in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ;
                  3) The aircraft is equipped with an operating automatic altitude reporting
                      transponder;
                  4) Before operating an aircraft in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ, the
                      pilot obtains and transmits a discrete transponder code from Air Traffic
                      Control, and the aircraft's transponder continues to transmit the assigned
                      code while operating within the DC SFRA;
                  5) For VFR operations, the pilot must file and activate a DC FRZ or DC
                      SFRA flight plan by obtaining a discrete transponder code. The flight
                      plan is closed upon landing at an airport within the DC SFRA or when the
                      aircraft exits the DC SFRA;

         (b) Paragraph (a)(5) of this section does not apply to operators of Department of
             Defense aircraft, law enforcement operations, or lifeguard or air ambulance
             operations under an FAA/TSA airspace authorization, if the flight crew is in
             contract with Air Traffic Control and is transmitting an Air Traffic Control-
             assigned discrete transponder code.

         (c) When operating an aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern at an airport within the DC
             SFRA (but not within the DC FRZ) that does not have an airport traffic control
             tower, a pilot must--
                  1) File a DC SFRA flight plan for traffic pattern work;
                  2) Communicate traffic pattern position via the published Common Traffic
                      Advisory Frequency (CRAF);
                  3) Monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or UFH frequency 243.0, if the aircraft is
                      suitably equipped;
                  4) Obtain and transmit the Air Traffic Control-assigned discrete transponder
                      code; and
                  5) When exiting the VFR traffic pattern, comply with paragraphs (a)(1)
                      through (a)(7) of this section.

         (d) When operating an aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern at an airport within the DC
             SFRA (but not within the DC FRZ) that has an operating airport traffic control
             tower, a pilot must:

Page 26  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

                  1) Before departure or before entering the traffic pattern, request to remain
                      in the traffic pattern;

                  2) Remain in two-way radio communications with the tower. If the aircraft is
                      suitably equipped, the pilot must also monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or
                      UHF frequency 243.0;

                  3) Continuously operate the aircraft transponder on code 1234 unless Air
                      Traffic Control assigns a different code; and

                  4) Before exiting the traffic pattern, comply with paragraphs (a)(1) through
                      (a)(7) of this section

         (e) Pilots must transit the assigned transponder code. No pilot may use transponder
             code 1200 while in the DC SFRA.

    As a result of the size of both the mUAS and sUAS, neither asset has the ability to carry two-
    way communications and a transponder on-board to track and communicate with the ATC.
    However, the Petitioner shall engage and maintain communications with the Washington Flight
    Standards Office by cell phone stating its current flight operation, location, altitude, and
    operational timeframe when conducting operations within the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ.
    The PIC shall obtain readings from the communication link between the controller and UAS to
    include battery level, altitude, distance from PIC, and location for all flight operations.

    As part of preflight plans, the operator shall review all NOTAMs and file a DC SFRA Flight
    Plan with the Washington Flight Standards Office. The operator shall state that "we would like
    to file a DC SFRA flight plan for a VFR flight at subject property located at
    ___________________________________________ being inspected." Next, the operator shall
    remain only in Class G airspace and request approval to conduct flight operations. During flight
    operations, the operator shall maintain communications with the Washington Flight Standards
    Office stating current flight operations, location, and altitude. Once flight operations ends, the
    operator shall notify the Washington Flight Standards Offices by cell phone that flight operations
    are closed. Given these operational procedures, an equivalent level of means to identify, track
    (locate), and communicate with the operator during flight operations provides the necessary
    rationale to operate in the DC FRZ and DC SFRA.

5.16 14 C.F.R. Subchapter F, Part 93-Special Air Traffic Rules, Subpart V-Washington,
       DC Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules, §93.341 (a);(c1) through (c5);(d): Aircraft
       Operations in the DC FRZ

    The Petitioner seeks an exemption from 14 C.F.R. §93.341 (a); (c1) through (c5) and (d) which
    states that:

         (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no pilot may conduct any flight
             operation under part 91, 101, 103, 105, 125, 133, 135, or 137 of this chapter in the
             DC FRZ, unless the specific flight is operating under an FAA/TSA authorization.

         (b) (b) Department of Defense (DOD) operations, law enforcement operations, and
             lifeguard or air ambulance operations under an FAA/TSA airspace authorization
             are exempted from the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section if the pilot is in
             contact with Air Traffic Control and operates the aircraft transponder on an Air
             Traffic Control-assigned beacon code.

U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

         (c) The following aircraft operations are permitted in the DC FRZ:
                  1) Aircraft operations under the DCA Access Standard Security Program
                      (DASSP) (49 CFR part 1562) with a Transportation Security
                      Administration (TSA) flight authorization.
                  2) Law enforcement and other U.S. Federal aircraft operations with prior FAA
                      approval.
                  3) Foreign-operated military and state aircraft operations with a State
                      Department-authorized diplomatic clearance, with State Department
                      notification to the FAA and TSA.
                  4) Federal, State, Federal DOD contract, local government agency aircraft
                      operations and part 121, 129 or 135 air carrier flights with TSA-approved
                      full aircraft operator standard security programs/procedures, if operating
                      with DOD permission and notification to the FAA and the National Capital
                      Regional Coordination Center (NCRCC). These flights may land and depart
                      Andrews Air Force Base, MD, with prior permission, if required.
                  5) Aircraft operations maintaining radio contact with Air Traffic Control and
                      continuously transmitting an Air Traffic Control-assigned discrete
                      transponder code. The pilot must monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or UHF
                      frequency 243.0.

         (d) Before departing from an airport within the DC FRZ, or before entering the DC
             FRZ, all aircraft, except DOD, law enforcement, and lifeguard or air ambulance
             aircraft operating under an FAA/TSA airspace authorization must file and activate
             an IFR or a DC FRZ or a DC SFRA flight plan and transmit a discrete transponder
             code assigned by an Air Traffic Control facility. Aircraft must transmit the discrete
             transponder code at all times while in the DC FRZ or DC SFRA.

    Given that an equivalent level of means to identify, track (locate), and communicate with the
    operator during flight operations provides the necessary rationale to operate in the DC FRZ and
    DC SFRA, the Petitioner requests authorization from the FAA/TSA to conduct flight operations
    in the Class G airspace. All PICs and visual camera operators shall have background checks
    conducted by the TSA. Additionally, the Petitioner shall engage and maintain contact with the
    Washington Flight Standards Office by cell phone, without the need for the pilot to monitor VHF
    frequency 121.5 or UHF frequency 243.0. Also, there will not be a need to transmit a discrete
    transponder code assigned by the ATC, since the UAS doesn't have an onboard transponder and
    that the operator will be notifying the Washington Flight Standards Offices by cell phone of the
    start and end of flight operations in the DC FRZ and DC SFRA. The Petitioner believes that this
    system will provide a high-level of notification, tracking and communicating with the FAA,
    which ensures a level of safety equal to or greater than the rules from which this exemption is
    requested.

6 Public Interest

    Across the United States, State & local municipalities are responsible for protecting the health,
    safety, economic interests and the quality of life of local residents, businesses and visitors to
    their specific jurisdictions. These municipalities' charge an agency to regulate construction
    activities for compliance determination and inspections of vacant or occupied buildings, crane

Page 28  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    assembly and bridges. However, as a result of budget cuts, many jurisdictions had to reduce
    resources and the number of government employees to monitor, assess, and inspect these
    activities. These agencies are faced with a public health and safety crisis that requires the use of
    aerial technology using UASs. The Petitioner's UASs will significantly increase productivity
    and reduce the inherent safety risks to property and personnel. The UASs will capture critical
    images that can then be uploaded to cloud software for rendering and can be processed into
    orthomosaic and 3D images that will serve as evidence to fine and prosecute individuals breaking
    local rules.

    In order for the FAA to consider a petition for exemption, the petition must meet the requirements
    of 14 CFR §11.81(d), which requires the Petitioner to state the reasons why granting a request
    would be in the public interest and how it would benefit the public as a whole. Granting the
    approval of exemption of UAS commercial operations for conducting aerial public safety
    inspections and photography of vacant/and or occupied buildings, temporary tower crane
    assembly verification inspection, determine compliance with respect to construction activities,
    and substructure bridge inspections will benefit the public as a whole in many aspects.

6.1 The Need for Aerial Building Photography & Inspections

    In general, a vacant property becomes a problem when the property owner abandons the basic
    responsibilities of ownership, such as routine maintenance or mortgage and property tax
    payments. Multiple variables can lead authorities to designate a property as either vacant or
    abandoned, including the physical condition of a structure, the amount of time that a property
    has been in that particular condition, and the relationship of the owner to the property. For
    example, in Baltimore, the city building code defines residences as vacant only if they are
    uninhabitable, not if they are merely unoccupied. Also, in the District of Columbia, the Vacant
    Building Enforcement Unit reaches out to owners of vacant buildings, and maintains a list of all
    vacant and blighted buildings. This list is used by the District of Columbia's Office of Tax and
    Revenue in reclassifying vacant buildings to the higher property tax rate, as mandated by DC
    Official Code.

    The absence of universal definitions of vacancy and abandonment complicates efforts to assess
    the number of vacant and abandoned properties nationally. The best aggregate sources include
    the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Postal Service, although these are not without limitations.
    Using these sources, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2011 that
    vacant residential units, not including those used seasonally or by migrant workers, increased
    from 7 million in 2000 to 10 million in 2010. The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard
    University reported that a subset of this category, homes vacant and not being marketed for sale
    or rent, reached a record high of 7.4 million in 2012, with increases concentrated in the high-
    foreclosure areas of the South and West. Although vacant homes can be found throughout the
    country, they tend to be concentrated; nearly 40 percent of the nation's vacant homes are located
    in just 10 percent of all census tracts. More than half of the census tracts with vacancy rates of
    20 percent or higher were in just 50 counties, most of them in metropolitan areas. Wayne County
    in Michigan and Cook County in Illinois, for example, each have more than 200 high-vacancy
    neighborhoods. Another example is in the District of Columbia, where this 10 square mile city
    has over 3,000 vacant and abandon buildings. In addition to the many vacant and abandoned

Page 29  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    residential properties across the nation, estimates place the number of brownfields -- idle former
    industrial properties with real or perceived environmental contamination -- at approximately a
    half-million (HUD, 2014).

    The use of UASs for inspecting vacant and abandon buildings is warranted and can considerably
    reduce the risk of building collapse and identify dangerous building conditions for citizens. An
    inspector may not have the most effective access to monitor, collect, and assess potential building
    code violations. Also, he or she may not have access to the rear of the building, which could be
    land locked by other buildings or by other obstacles. Moreover, a mUAS can gather more
    information safely, survey the alleged violation, and save lives from buildings that may collapse.
    For example, the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus has the capability to inspect, photograph, capture,
    collect images, and upload data to cloud software that is rendered into 3D images. The inspector
    can now have the ability to gather 2D volumetric data points and view a 3D image of the entire
    building through the use of the mUAS's ability to hoover and circle the site.

6.2 The Need for Substructure Bridge Inspections

    In a recent analysis of the U.S. Department of Transportation's bridge inventory database, the
    2015 American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) Report found that over
    61,000 bridges in the U.S. need structural repair. The analysis of the federal government data,
    conducted by ARTBA's Chief Economist Dr. Alison Premo Black, shows cars, trucks and school
    buses cross the nation's 61,064 structurally compromised bridges 215 million times every
    day. Not surprisingly, the most heavily traveled are on the Interstate Highway System, which
    carries the bulk of truck traffic and passenger vehicles (Houlihan, 2015).

    Dr. Black suggests that the bridge problem could get worse. For instance, the Federal Highway
    Trust Fund (HTF) is the source of 52 percent of highway and bridge capital investments made
    annually by state governments. The HTF has suffered five revenue shortfalls between 2008 and
    2014, and has been bailed out with nearly $65 billion in revenues from the General Fund just to
    preserve existing investment levels. Nearly a dozen states so far have canceled or delayed road
    and bridge projects because of the continued uncertainty over the trust fund situation. "State and
    local governments are doing the best they can to address these significant challenges, given
    limited resources," Black says. ARTBA expects that number to increase as the deadline nears.
    "Many of the most heavily traveled bridges are nearly 50 years old. Elected officials can't just
    sprinkle fairy dust on America's bridge problem and wish it away," Dr. Black said. "Bridge
    decks and support structures are regularly inspected by the state transportation departments for
    deterioration and are rated on a scale of zero to nine--nine being "excellent" condition. A bridge
    is classified as structurally deficient and in need of repair if its overall rating is four or below.
    The ARTBA analysis of the bridge data supplied by the states to the U.S. DOT also found
    (Houlihan, 2015):

          Pennsylvania (5,050), Iowa (5,022),

         Oklahoma (4,216), Missouri (3,310),

         Nebraska (2,654), California (2,501),

         Kansas (2,416), Mississippi (2,275),

         Illinois (2,216) and North Carolina

         (2,199) have the highest numbers of

         structurally deficient bridges. The

         District of Columbia (14), Nevada (34),

         Delaware (48), Hawaii (61), and Utah

         (102) have the least.                    Figure 3: A bridge inspection using truck & boom.

          At least 15 percent of the bridges in eight states--Rhode Island (23 percent),
             Pennsylvania (22 percent), Iowa (21 percent), South Dakota (20 percent),
             Oklahoma (18 percent), Nebraska (17 percent), North Dakota (16 percent) and
             Maine (15 percent)--fall in the structurally deficient category.

These State Bridge Inspection Units are responsible for managing their local transportation
structures. This includes performing bridge inspections in accordance with Federal regulations
on all bridges owned by local government agencies, making structure work repair
recommendations, determining the safe load capacity of all bridges, reviewing and approving
encroachment permits. These agencies hire engineering contractors or use internal staff to
inspect bridges. Various methods are used to inspect bridges. They include the use of helicopters,
truck & boom, underwater diving, trailer mounted units, and water taxi inspections (see Figure
3). However, these agencies are faced with many challenges using these current methods. One
such method, as shown in Figure 3, include utilizing a mobile inspection vehicle to lower
inspectors over the side of the bridge. This method causes traffic congestion, accidents, and has
the risk of the inspector falling out of the boom carry box. Challenges that agencies must mitigate
include:

          Reduced work windows because of high traffic demands thus limiting inspectors'
             access to key sections of bridges.

          More stringent regulatory obligations also require adjustments to inspection
             schedules to accommodate nesting periods of protected migratory bird species.

          Inspection schedules have flexibility built to accommodate unplanned inspections
             in the case of a bridge suffering unexpected damage.

          New FHWA inspection performance measures require a bridge to be inspected as
             close as possible to the date plus the inspection cycle (typically 2 years).

The use of UASs for inspecting bridge substructures is warranted and the Petitioner's planned
operations dramatically improves safety and reduces risk concerning bridge inspections by
alleviating human exposure to dangers associated with current methods such as helicopters, truck
& boom, underwater diving, trailer mounted units, and water taxi inspections. The most used
method, mobile truck and boom, is dangerous to ongoing motor vehicles and has caused serious
accidents over the years. In addition, these standard procedures are extremely labor-intensive
and time consuming. sUASs serves as a feasible solution for State Bridge Inspection Units
seeking an alternative method that is safer, less expensive, and efficient. For example, using the

    Tali H500, we have the capability to inspect, capture, collect infrared data for analysis and upload
    data to cloud software that allows engineers to conduct detail assessment of the bridge
    substructure.

6.3 The Need for Construction Inspections

    Construction is a high hazard industry that comprises a wide range of activities involving
    construction, alteration, and/or repair. Examples include residential construction, commercial
    building erection, excavations, demolitions, and large scale jobs. Construction workers engage
    in many activities that may expose them to serious hazards, such as falling from rooftops,
    unguarded machinery, being struck by heavy construction equipment, electrocutions, silica dust,
    and asbestos (U.S. Department of Labor, 2015).

    In general, construction activities falls into two categories, those activities which are conducted
    in compliance with applicable authorities and those which are not. The vast number of compliant
    activities are accounted for with permits. Construction activities which are conducted in
    compliance with permits or regulations are inherently conducted in a safer manner. City
    inspectors are not onsite full-time to assess potential dangers from deficiencies in excavation,
    grading, building footings, foundations, and framing. Some general contractors and home
    owners bypass the permitting process and begin and complete construction activities which are
    not in compliance with the applicable regulatory or statutory authority. These noncompliant
    activities are frequently missed by city inspectors, but are often discovered after an accident or
    the death of workers or citizens.

    Construction which is conducted in violation of permitting or regulatory requirements is difficult
    to uncover due to some privacy and trespassing rules. Many times, neighbors or concerned
    citizens call city inspectors to notify them of suspicious construction activities or projects. City
    inspectors are often thwarted from pursuing an enforcement or compliance action by the simple
    fact that the homeowner may not be home or the property owner may not be on site at the time
    of the attempted inspection. The city inspector cannot gather evidence to support a case for
    noncompliance without violating city regulations with respect to access to private property.

    The use of UASs for determining whether construction sites are in compliance with applicable
    permits and regulations is justified and can considerably reduce the risk to inspectors, workers,
    residents, and survey teams. To monitor, gather, and collect data would often require an
    inspector to get this information from difficult or dangerous areas onsite or be at risk of possibly
    falling at the jobsite. Falls are the leading source of workplace fatalities and injuries on
    construction sites (OSHA, 2015). However, a UAS can gather more information safely, reduce
    falls, and save lives on these types of construction sites. For example, the DJI Phantom 2 Vision
    Plus has the capability to inspect, photograph, capture, collect images, and upload data to cloud
    software that is rendered into 3D images and maps. As a result of this technology, the building
    inspector, now has the ability to gather data and view building site progress without going to the
    site.

6.4 The Need for Temporary Tower Crane Assembly Verification Inspections

    The Federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) is a small agency that has
    approximately 2,200 inspectors responsible for the health and safety of 130 million workers,
    employed at more than 8 million worksites around the nation -- which translates to about one
    compliance officer for every 59,000 workers.

    OSHA estimates that there are about 125,000 cranes in operation in the construction industry in
    the United States every day. There are an additional 80,000 to 100,000 involved in the maritime
    shipping industry. Because cranes are so large, and the weights they carry are so immense, even
    the slightest operator error or improperly maintained bolt can result in a catastrophic accident.

    Early governmental regulation of the crane and rigging industries was light, mostly occurring at
    the state level. The most significant development in the regulatory landscape took place when
    the OSHA Act of 1970 was signed into law. OSHA regulations lagged behind industry standards
    until 2010, when a broad update of OSHA construction crane regulations went into effect. In
    developing the new regulations, OSHA consulted with a panel of industry experts and applied
    cost-benefit analyses in addition to unalloyed safety considerations. Though portions of the
    regulations remain controversial in the industry, the agency clearly based its work on a broad
    view without reacting "knee-jerk" to particular events of failures (Shapiro & Ratay, 2013).

    By its very nature, construction is a challenging and dangerous industry. In contrast to most
    industries, construction often requires travel to multiple sites, each with their own constantly
    changing hazards. Temporary tower cranes play an essential role on construction sites
    throughout the United States on a daily basis. Also, temporary tower cranes add many complex
    risks to the construction process. Recently, numerous fatal crane collapses have grabbed national
    news headlines, increasing attention and scrutiny of construction crane operations. The most
    highly publicized being massive tower crane failures in New York, Miami, and Seattle. Estimates
    indicate that up to 33% of construction casualties and between 8 to 16% of construction fatalities
    involve cranes (Parfitt, 2010).

    Between 1992 and 2006, 610 construction worker deaths were attributed to crane accidents,
    about 42 per year. Nearly two-thirds of all crane-related accidents are caused by tower style
    cranes. Other styles responsible for injuries include mobile cranes, gantries and loader cranes. In
    the US, most medium-sized and large construction sites are serviced by mobile cranes. Their
    variety, purposes and duration of use vary greatly. A truck-mounted mobile crane may show up
    at a site to make a handful of picks before departing, while a crawler crane could be set up for a
    year-long assignment. Mobility confers its own set of hazards, inferring likelihood that an
    operating site has not been adequately surveyed beforehand and perhaps not prepared for the
    presence of a crane. Moreover, the operator and crew may be encountering unfamiliar conditions
    with unexplored hazards. Mobility also confers the possibility of last-minute changes or
    improvisations, defeating the benefit of a plan (Shapiro & Ratay, 2013). The Petitioner's work
    shall focus on the assembly/disassembly failures and among mobile cranes, the frequent types
    of serious accidents are:

Page 33  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

          Electrocution ­ the victims is usually a rigger handling the load when the boom or
             load line contacts an overhead power line.

          Overturning ­ caused by overloading, ground support failure or improper
             operation of the crane (see Figure 4).

          Collision ­ a portion the crane or a suspended load strikes a building, person or
             object, or a suspended load is trapped.

          Over-travel ­ the load block strikes the boom tip or boom runs up against the
             backstops.

          Structural failure ­ from excessive side loading, overloading or an equipment
             deficiency.

          Assembly/disassembly failure ­ the crew deviates from a qualified procedure.
          Crushing ­ a worker is caught by a rotating or moving part such as a revolving

             deck or a spooling rope.

Similar types of accidents can occur with tower cranes,   Figure 4: A crawler crane relies on firm level
albeit less frequently because tower cranes tend to work  ground support to keep it from tipping.
under more controlled circumstances than mobile
cranes. Tower cranes are used in the US primarily on
major construction sites. By nature, they are fixed or
semi-fixed in place and, therefore, less prone to
problems caused by scanty planning, hasty preparation
or last-minute improvisation. The greatest exposure of
these machines to accidents occurs when they are being
erected, dismantled or jumped (Shapiro & Ratay,
2013).

A crane accident in the core of a large city can be a catastrophic event that splashes across
television screens and tabloid covers (see Figure 5). Government officials are compelled by
public outcry to react; their constituents must be made to feel safe while walking through streets
stalked by the shadows of giant construction cranes. Under such circumstances, major accidents
in dense urban zones have spurred the creation of crane regulations, particularly in California
and New York. Officials in other localities have reacted similarly to singular dramatic accidents,
sometimes creating laws that are closely crafted to the particularities of the accidents that
spawned them (Shapiro & Ratay, 2013).

This jagged path to the making of crane rules is an aberration. The great bulk of crane standards
and regulations in both the United States and the world at large are, instead, the product of a
steady progression of deliberations, built upon collective knowledge and wisdom acquired over
decades. Much of the knowledge, unfortunately, comes
from the experience of accidents.

Most crane accidents do not occur in the center of       Figure 5: On the Upper East Side of Manhattan,
major cities, nor do they make the front pages of        a tower crane collapsed during a climbing

much greater human and economic toll than the            massive property damage.
headline-grabbers. They do not, however, escape
attention. Stakeholders, who suffer the losses and deal
with the consequences, do not ordinarily forget them
(see Figure 6). For those apt to learn from experience,
the cruel lessons of a serious mishap will be
internalized, analyzed and applied (Shapiro & Ratay,
2013).

Regardless of what laws are in the books -- if enforcement is lacking -- conditions are not apt to
improve. The arrest of former inspector Edward J. Marquette for allegedly falsify a business
record and filing it with the buildings department has reduced the number of crane inspectors in
New York to four. With only four inspectors being left responsible for 250 cranes in use, of
which 30 are tower cranes, the ability to fully enforce regulations is clearly questionable
(Sawyer, et al., 2008). Moreover, some building inspection units don't have certified inspectors
to climb and assess cranes. For example, in the District of Columbia, there are over 52 cranes in
operations that are required to be inspected by law. However, the D.C. Building Inspection Unit
does not have a certified inspector on staff to enforce the regulations.

The use of UASs for inspecting cranes is justified and
alleviates human exposure to danger associated with
this high-risk job. The current crane inspection method
consists of an inspector climbing the crane and visually
inspecting the base, mast, jib, and counter-jib.
Inspectors are at risk and are exposed to unsafe
conditions when conducting these inspections. In
some situations, building inspection units may rely on
the general contractor to conduct self-inspection of the
crane, since they lack the resources to provide a
certified staff to verify the assembly. The Petitioner's Figure 6: A half-mile-long cableway across
planned operations addresses the safety issues and Black Canyon on the Colorado River collapsed
diminishes the risk to workers, inspectors, and citizens during high winds. Its loss set back construction
by ensuring that the assembly was constructed of a vital interstate bridge link by two years.
properly and reduces the chances of crane failure. To further enhance safety and the public
interest, the inspector has the ability to review, inspect, and assess the entire crane from detailed
images gathered from the UAS. The UAS has the capability to capture and upload data to cloud

Page 35  Petition of Alternatives Renewable Solutions, LLC for Exemption Pursuant to Section 333 of FMRA of 2012
U.S. Department of Transportation- Docket Management System
May 23, 2015

    software that renders the crane as a 3D image. The inspector, located onsite, now has the ability
    to view 3D images of the entire crane within 45 minutes.

    The Petitioner's UASs remove the environmental impact by significantly decreasing the energy
    used for aerial imaging for crane, bridge and construction site inspections. The UAS uses a
    rechargeable lithium polymer battery, as opposed to Jet A or JP5 (kerosene based) fuel that burns
    in the operations of a helicopter, which weights thousands of pounds. Also, the public's interest
    is further minimized in the event of an accident, thus reducing the human exposure to harmful
    carbon emissions associated with helicopters and/or manned aircraft.

    In addition, the Petitioner's UASs may well replace the need to use helicopters and manned
    aircraft to inspect cranes, bridges, and construction sites. For our planned operations, our
    proposed UASs are under 6 pounds and carry no combustible fuel on board, as opposed to the
    larger powered helicopters and manned aircraft. The paradigm shift to UASs from larger manned
    aircraft minimizes risks to the public and improves the overall health and safety of workers.

    Finally, granting this Petitioner's exemption application will fulfill Congress's intent of allowing
    UASs to operate with significant safety precautions in low risk environments as stated in Section
    333 (a) ­ (c) of the FMRA. The law directs the FAA Administrator to grant case-by-case
    authorization for certain unmanned aircraft to perform commercial operations prior to the
    finalization of the small UAS Rule under Section 332 of FMRA, which will be the primary
    method for authorizing small UAS operations once it is complete (Section 333, 2015). In
    addition, the Petitioner's goal is to aide and assist government agencies as a contractor to perform
    aerial public safety inspections and photography of vacant/and or occupied buildings, crane
    assembly verification, construction activities for compliance determination, and substructure bridge
    inspections using UASs. As a result, the public as a whole will benefit from the safer, efficient,
    and reliable aerial services that UASs operations will provide for state and local government
    agencies.

          FOR-CAUSE TESTING: The Company may ask an employee or contractor to
             submit to a drug and/or alcohol test at any time it feels that the employee or contractor
             may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, including, but not limited to, the
             following circumstances: evidence of drugs or alcohol on or about the his/her person
             or in the his/her vicinity, unusual conduct on the his/her part that suggests impairment
             or influence of drugs or alcohol, negative performance patterns, or excessive and
             unexplained absenteeism or tardiness.

          POST-ACCIDENT TESTING: Any employee or contractor involved in an on-the-
             job accident or injury under circumstances that suggest possible use or influence of
             drugs or alcohol in the accident or injury event may be asked to submit to a drug
             and/or alcohol test. "Involved in an on-the-job accident or injury" means not only the
             one who was or could have been injured, but also any employee or contractor who
             potentially contributed to the accident or injury event in any way.

    If an employee or contractor is tested for drugs or alcohol outside of the employment/contractor
    context and the results indicate a violation of this policy, or if an employee/contractor refuses a
    request to submit to testing under this policy, the he or she may be subject to appropriate
    disciplinary action, up to and possibly including discharge from contract or employment. In such
    a case, the employee/contractor will be given an opportunity to explain the circumstances prior
    to any final action becoming effective.
