                                                      Exemption No. 11238A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0719

Mr. Dallas Cormier
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
8316 Century Park Court
San Diego, CA 92123

Dear Mr. Cormier:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition to amend Exemption No.
11238. It explains the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the
original conditions and limitations.

By letter dated March 26, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to Exemption No. 11238. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4)
and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a),
91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal
Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to perform aerial data collection. You requested
an amendment to add four new aircraft, the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen3, the Pulse Aerospace
Vapor 35, Vapor 55, and the PrecisionHawk Lancaster Hawkeye.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                            2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11238
remains valid with respect to this exemption and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the
authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the
Administrator, San Diego Gas & Electric Company is granted an amendment to its exemption
that adds four new aircraft: InstantEye Mk-2 Gen 3, Pulse Aerospace Vapor 35, Vapor 55,
and the PrecisionHawk Lancaster Hawkeye.

The operator shall add this amendment to the original Exemption No. 11238.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11238 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft, and is
amended as follows.

In this grant of exemption, San Diego Gas & Electric Company is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the InstantEye Mk-2
    including the Gen 2 and Gen 3)1, Pulse Aerospace Vapor 35, Vapor 55, and the

    PrecisionHawk Lancaster Hawkeye when weighing less than 55 pounds including

    payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a

    petition to amend this exemption.

1Per Exemption No. 11238 issued on March 26, 2015, the FAA authorized the use of the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen2.
                                                                                                                  3

This exemption terminates on March 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.
Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) received Exemption No. 11238 on March 26,
2015 for the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen2.

SDG&E is requesting to amend that exemption to include three additional Unmanned Aircraft
models: the Pulse Aerospace Vapor 35, Vapor 55 and the PrecisionHawk Lancaster Hawkeye.
All Unmanned Aircraft are less than 55 lbs including payload and proprietary manuals will be
submitted along with this amendment.

The Pulse Aerospace Vapor 35 has already received exemption No. 11241 with Phoenix Air
Unmanned. The Vapor 55 is a scaled up version of the Vapor 35. The main difference between
the Vapor 35 and Vapor 55 is the size, the maximum takeoff weight for the Vapor 35 is 30lbs and
the max takeoff weight for the Vapor 55 is 55lbs. Performance is the same for both UAVs to
include the same flight controls, safety features, autopilot, and avionics.

Precision Hawk Lancaster Hawkeye has also already received and exemption, Exemption No.
11274 with United Services Automobile Association on April 2, 2015.

None of our operations would change; we are just requesting to add additional Unmanned
Aircraft to our exemption for greater flexibility.

                                                                                                                                   1

San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) received Exemption No. 11238 on March 26,
2015 for the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen2.

SDG&E is requesting to amended that exemption to include the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen3. Because
it took over 6 months for our exemption request to get approved, the InstantEye Mk-2 Gen2 is
now obsolete.

The InstantEye Gen 3 is the same Unmanned Aircraft as the Gen 2 but it's bigger in size and
capabilities. The InstantEye is a vertical take off and landing (VTOL) quadrotor small unmanned
aerial system (sUAS). The aircraft is in a "X" configuration with 4 rotors centered at the tips of
its carbon fiber arms separated by 22.23 cm on a side for the Gen 3 vs. 20 cm on the Mk-2. The
aircraft is all-electric with a brushless motor driving each rotor. There is a 4 Amp/Hour Lithium
polymer rechargeable /replaceable battery at the bottom of the center of the aircraft on the Gen 3
vs. a 2 Amp/hour on the Gen 2. Maximum gross takeoff weight for the Gen 3 is 725g and the Gen
2 is 610g. Maximum endurance for the Gen 3 is 30 minutes and 20minutes for the Gen 3.

                                                                       1
