Whitefish, MT 59937

Dear Ms. Scholl and Mr. Scholl:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated March 13, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of GravityShots.com, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct operations in
the film industry, TV productions, real estate photography and video, surveying for
development, agriculture inspection, and aerial mapping.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the FreeFly CineStar 8, FreeFly CineStar 6, and DJI
Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, GravityShots.com, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, GravityShots.com, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the FreeFly CineStar
         8, FreeFly CineStar 6, and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
                                                                                                            4

    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

GravityShots.com, Inc. seeks relief on the above sections of 14 C.F.R. for use of their sUAVs in the film
industry, TV productions, real estate photography & video, surveying for development, agriculture
inspection, aerial mapping.

Granting GravityShots.com, Inc. an exemption will greatly benefit the public for a number of reasons:
              · Create a positive environment for sUAVs as whole. By creating breathtaking aerial
                   imagery the public is drawn to our content. We advocate safety as a top priority and
                   share safety concerns when flying.
                        1. Learn to fly on hobby grade equipment first. Putting many hours into learning
                             the orientations and performance of the equipment.
                        2. Once you have gained hours you can advance to a smaller UAV.
                        3. Always create a pre-flight check list and follow the FAA regulations set in place,
                             do not fly above 400 feet, do not fly in restricted air space, within 5 miles of an
                             airport
                        4. Always have an observer with your pilot, to help create a safe environment for
                             the sUAV and pilot. As the observer you can help educate the public. By asking
                             them to stay back from the sUAV, do not allow the public to talk to the pilot
                             while they are flying, making sure there is a safe take off and landing place free
                             and clear of obstacles.
                        5. Always keep your sUAV in visual line of sight.
                        6. Always perform maintenance on your sUAV and check the validity. Make sure
                             all equipment has been charged before each flight.
                        7. Respect and maintain public privacy.
                        8. Never fly over people or crowds.
                        9. Never fly under the influence of alcohol or other substances.
                        10. Never fly near or around power lines.
                        11. Never fly in high winds or bad weather.

              · Provide professional education to the public.
              · Use of sUAVs verses full scale helicopters provide a safer environment for filming.
              · Provide economic growth for the public by allowing the public to hire GravityShots.com,

                   Inc.

The exemption would not adversely affect safety, in fact it would create a safe environment and
example of a professional operation adhering to the FAA standards that are currently set in place.

In November of 2010, Jeffrey started flying and building multi-rotor platforms. Together with his wife,
Adele as the observer, they gathered hours of safely flying these platforms.

Jeffrey's skills as a full scale and RC pilot are unique with many years of experience. From the first time
that he took the sticks with his single rotor RC helicopters, he has learned to fly all crafts in manual
mode. Not relying on GPS guidance or way point flying. He believes that you must learn to master the
craft, before you can use these automated features, as they are not always reliable.

Through constant research and development Jeffrey Scholl stays on top of updates and advancements in
technology.

GravityShots.com, Inc. Safety Policies in place:

Before starting

    · Check the reliability of the Multi-Rotor.
    · The flight battery and transmitter battery must be fully charged.
    · Always turn on the transmitter first and then the Multi-Rotor.
    · Watch for visible damage such as loose screws, broken, unbalanced or damaged propellers,

         faulty connectors or solder joints, broken pipes, etc.
    · The propeller must be in a good condition and securely mounted. The rotors must spin

         smoothly. Please ensure that there are no objects are in the rotational plane of the propellers or
         within a distance that poses a risk of obstruction. Rotating propeller ends are dangerous to
         touch - never touch a rotating propeller with fingers or other body parts.
    · Ensure the appropriate to the audible beeps when auto lipo-detection is enabled. 6 * beep
         means 6s Lipo
    · Ensure that the selected channel on the remote control is free and that you're within range of
         the transmitter.
    · Ensure the sensors are calibrated (when the motors are off move yaw and gas stick into upper
         left corner until it beeps).
    · Different settings can result in fundamentally different flight characteristics and occupation of
         the Channel functions. Make sure that you are familiar with the setting and its features.
    · After starting the motors, check that all motors are running and rotate evenly. Please fly
         carefully at a low altitude until you know that everything is working fine.
    · Perform a pre-flight check (see checklist below).
    · Start manually - switch off altitude control and GPS.

Checklist (pre-flight check)

    · Weather conditions are suitable.
    · Frame and all screws are tight.
    · Propeller not damaged and tightly fixed.
    · Battery fully charged and securely mounted.
    · Transmitter battery charged and the antennas are free.
    · Channel of the transmitter is not busy. If 35/40/70MHz or other MHz-RC-controls are in

         operation simultaneously, the used channels must be checked with the other pilots (not
         necessary for 2.4 GHz systems).
    · Check RC(TX/RX) operation range (on the ground!) from time to time (and before 1st flight).
    · Ensure there is nothing in the danger zone of the propeller.
    · Ensure enough space for launch and flight.
    · Ensure the GPS module (if any) has GPS fix. If CH or PH is active it will beep every second. Check
         that when you switch to GPS mode, there will be an audible beep.
    · For manual start ensure GPS and altitude controls are turned off.
    · Ensure sensors are calibrated and that the right setting is loaded.
    · Ensure the trim of the remote control is in neutral position.

During the flight

    · Do not take risks! Your own safety and that of your environment depend on the good behavior
         of the pilot. Always maintain a safe distance from people, animals and objects. Improper
         operation can cause serious injury and property damage! Never fly towards viewers and avoid
         flying over spectators.

    · Keep in mind that viewers could get close to the Multi-Rotor, without being aware of potential
         dangers.

    · Always turn off the Multi-Rotor first and disconnect the flight battery before turning off the
         transmitter.

    · Only fly in line of sight. In the case of manual control, you must be able to see the position and
         altitude. Never fly over 500 feet.

    · Never rely 100% on functions such as GPS, compass, or altitude control. You must always be
         able to take manual control of the Multi-Rotor.

    · Reduce the throttle or switch off the motors in case of a crash or failure.
    · Do not fly in restricted air space, such as in the vicinity of airports, etc.
    · Pay attention to under-voltage warning -flying on an empty battery can cause damage to the

         Lipos and crash.
    · If a defect or malfunction has occurred, it must be corrected before the next start.
    · When using GPS, take note that the position of the Multi-Rotor can change suddenly.

After the flight
    · Disconnect the battery and check all over for damage. Make sure that there is no damage to the
         propellers.

    · See the Handling and safety precautions of Lipos.
    · If the Multi-Rotor is involved in a crash or hard landing the sensors and electronics might be

         damaged. Before the next start everything must be checked.
