                                                           Exemption No. 12896
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2551

Mr. Henry W. Bauer
President
Guardian Group, Inc.
2350 West 205th Street
Torrance, CA 90501-1460

Dear Mr. Bauer:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 8, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Guardian Group, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and videography to survey areas of buildings, rooftops, and building exterior
envelopes.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 3 Professional.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Guardian Group, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Guardian Group, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3
    Professional when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of

         C. Extent ofReliefGGI's Seeks

GGI seeks exemption from several provisions ofTitle 14 CFR Parts 21, 45, 61, and 91 to the
extent necessary to engage in commercial operations of a small UAS on sites where GGI
conducts building inspections. If these exemptions are granted, GGI would operate the UAS with
the permission of the property owner. GGI intends to use a UAS for the following:

          Surveying hard-to-reach areas of building,
          Rooftop inspection,
          Building exterior envelope inspection.

Sections III to VIII detail the measures GGI will be taking during the UAS operations to meet or
exceed the level of safety authorized by the FAA, and demonstrate that GGI' s operations will not
adversely affect the safety of persons or property in the air or on the ground and do not pose a
threat to national security.

                                                      3 I 13
                                D. The Reasons why Granting GGI's Request Would Be in Public Interest
                       The proposed UAS operations in this petition significantly improve safety and reduce risk by
                       alleviating the public's exposure to danger associated with traditional inspection methods.
                       GGI will use the UAS as an alternative to large and inherently dangerous high-reach equipment
                       such as lifts or scaffolds.
                       Moreover, by using a UAS, GGI will reduce the risk of harm to employees by avoiding accident-
                       prone, dangerous situations such as rooftop inspections or building envelope inspections above
                       ground level. This would have a positive trickledown effect to families of GGI' s employees
                       which ultimately benefits the public.
                       The UAS that GGI intends to use is battery powered and does not release greenhouse gas
                       emissions.
                       GGI's UAS will be capable of documenting conditions that may have been otherwise inaccessible
                       using traditional inspection and survey methods.

                                E. The Reasons why Granting GGI's Request Would Not Adversely Affect
                                Safety
                       GGI's UAS operations will provide a level a safety that meet or exceed the level of safety
                       authorized by the FAA. The operating procedures that will be implemented by GGI are detailed
                       in sections III to VIII of the petition.
                                F. Summary
                       GGI seeks exemption from the requirements of Title 14 CFR Parts: 21 Subpart H, 45.23,
                       45.27(a), 61.113(a) and (b), 91.7(a), 91.9(b)(2) and (c), 91.103, 91.119, 91.121, 91.151(a)(l),
                       91.203(a) and (b), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(l), 91.409(a)(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) to the extent
                       necessary to operate a UAS to perform aerial inspections of buildings within the United States.
                                G. Additional Information Supporting GGI's Request
                       Sections III to VIII provide additional information supporting GGI's request.

III. DESCRIPTION OF PETITIONER
For over twenty years, GGI has served the surety, insurance, construction, legal, and banking
industries with distinction. Our demonstrated proficiency with surety claims consulting, property
claims consulting, construction claims, and construction consulting includes many of the world's
most cl1allenging projects. GGI's construction management and construction defect service value
is grounded in that same surety claims and surety consulting experience.
GGI provides clients a complete suite of construction defect services including, but not limited to:

          Field investigative inspection and testing,
          Defective construction analyses,
          Architectural and engineering failure analyses,
          Remedial repair scope and strategies.
GGI seeks to use VAS-assisted photography and video to survey hard-to-reach areas of
building, inspect rooftops, and building exterior envelopes. The use of a UAS would allow GGI
to better address its client's needs. It will provide a safer and more efficient mean to perform field
investigative inspections.
IV. UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM
The UAS proposed by GGI is the DJI Phantom 3 Pro ("DJI"). The DJI Phantom 3 Pro is a
battery-operated lightweight quadcopter with on-board equipment and controlled via radio
transmission from a separate Ground Control Station ("GCS") used. See Figure 1.
The on-board flight computer is in constant communication with the GCS and transmits live data
such as speed, compass direction of flight, and altitude levels.
The UAS contains a Global Positioning System ("GPS") tracking device and an on-board gimbal-
mounted camera capable of capturing full color high definition photos and videos.
The UAS is also equipped with a set ofLEDs and aircraft status indicators which not only
provide an enhanced visual from the ground but also assist the Pilot In Command ("PIC") to
confirm battery, GPS, and other functionalities of the UAS.

DJI Phantom 3 Pro is equipped with the FAILSAFE feature: Ifthe aircraft battery is running low,
or if the DJI loses the connection with your remote controller for any reason, the aircraft will
automatically return to the takeoff point and land safely.

Operation Conditions and Limitations -VAS Performance

The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will weigh less than 3 pounds including payload.

The speed ofthe DJI Phantom 3 Pro will not exceed 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
DJI Phantom 3 Pro will be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum Unmanned
Aircraft operating airspeed recommended by the manufacturer.

Ifthe UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the DJI Phantom 3 Pro will
return to a pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

         B. Pre-Flight Inspections, Maintenance, and Repair

GGI will implement all necessary procedures, such as pre-flight inspections, maintenance, and
repair to ensure that the DJI Phantom 3 Pro is in a condition for safe flight.

Operation Conditions and Limitations- Pre-Flight Inspections, Maintenance, and Repair
[Continued on next page]

          If the DJI Phantom 3 Pro is to undergo maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
          operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, the
          UAS will undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations.
          Functional test flights will only be conducted by a PIC with a Visual Observer ("VO")
          and must remain at least 500 feet from people. The functional test flight will be
          conducted in such a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

                        Operation Conditions and Limitations- Pre-Flight Inspections, Maintenance, and Repair

                                   GGI will be responsible for maintaining and inspecting the DJI Phantom 3 Pro to ensure
                                   that it is in a condition for safe operation.
                                   Prior to each flight, the PIC will conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the UAS is
                                   in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all potential
                                   discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the inspection reveals
                                   a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft will not be operated
                                   until necessary maintenance has been performed and the UAS is found to be in a
                                   condition for a safe flight.
                                   GGI will follow the DJI Phantom 3 Pro manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
                                   replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
                                   components.

                        Maintenance Operations Log (Vl.O).

                                  C. Radio Frequency

                        The operating frequency of the Remote Controller (i.e. GCS) ranges from 2.400 GHz to 2.483
                        GHz.

                        The radio frequency used for control of the UAS associated equipment (camera, sensors, etc.) is
                        2.4 GHz ISM.

                        The DJI Phantom 3 Pro complies with the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC")
                        regulations.

                       V. UNMANNED AIRCRAFT PILOT IN COMMAND
                        A designated pilot will be operating the DJI Phantom 3 Pro. GGI designated pilot will:

                                   Hold a private pilot's license,
                                   Hold a current third-class medical certificate,
                                   Have a deep knowledge and thorough understanding of the UAS and its operation,
                                   Have experience in operating the DJI Phantom 3 Pro.

Operation Conditions and Limitations- PIC Qualifications and Training

          GGI will not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates ability to safely
          operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated under this
          exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and maintaining appropriate
          distances from persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures. PIC qualification flight hours
          and currency will be logged in a manner consistent with Title 14 CPR Part 61.51 (b).
          Training operations will be conducted during dedicated training sessions.
          All operations will utilize a visual observer (VO).

VI. OPERATION OF THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT

         A. Intended UAS Operations

GGI intends to use the DJI Phantom 3 Proto perform forensic evaluations and building condition
assessments.

GGI' s operations will provide a superior level of safety. Please refer to sections Vl.B: Limitations
of UAS Operations, and VII: Discussion OfRequested Exemption, and attached document: GGI
UAS Flight Manual (Vl.O).

         B. Limitations Of UAS Operations

Operation Conditions and Limitations- UAS Operations [Continued on nextpage]

          The speed ofthe DJI Phantom 3 Pro will not exceed 87 knots (1 00 miles per hour). The
          DJI Phantom 3 Pro will be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum Unmanned
          Aircraft operating airspeed recommended by the mamifacturer. [Section IV.A]
          The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will not be operated at an altitude ofno more than 400feet
          Above the Ground Level ("AGL "). [Section IV.A]
          The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL.
          The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will be operated within the visual line of sight ("VLOS") of the
          PIC and VO at all times. The VO and PIC will be able to communicate verbally at all
          times. The PIC will ensure that the VO can perform the duties required of the VO.
          UAS operations will not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CPR§ 1.1. All
          operations will be conducted under visual meteorological conditions ("VMC").
          The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport having an
          operational control tower unless a letter of agreement with that airport's management is
          obtained or otherwise permitted by a Certificate Of Waiver or Authorization ("COA'')
          issued to GGI.
          The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000
          feet horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
          The PIC will abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

                                                          8 I 13
Operation Conditions and Limitations- UAS Operations

          The PIC will be prohibited from flying unless (considering wind and forecast weather
          conditions) there is enough available power for the UAS to conduct the intended
          operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve power
          recommended by the manufacturer if greater.
          The DJI Phantom 3 Pro will remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations
          and activities at all times.
          The UAS will not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

          All flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
          persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless: a. Barriers or structures are present that
          sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the UAS and/or debris in the event of
          an accident. GGI will ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection.
          If a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within
          500 feet of the UAS, flight operations will cease immediately in a manner ensuring the
          safety of nonparticipating persons; and b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles
          or structures has granted permission for operating closer to those objects, and the PIC has
          made a safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined
          that it does not present an undue hazard.
          All operations will be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
          permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative. Permission
          from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be obtained for each
          flight to be conducted.

VII. DISCUSSION OF REQUESTED EXEMPTIONS

         A. Title 24 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Certification Procedures for Products
          and Parts, Airworthiness Certificates

The FAA has stated that no exemption is needed from this section if a finding is made under the
Reform Act that the UAS selected provides an equivalent level of safety when compared to
aircraft normally used for the same application. See granted exemption to Astraeus Aerial, Docket
No. FAA-2014-0352 at 13-14, 22. If, however, the FAA determines that there are some
characteristics of the chosen UAS that fail to meet the requirements of the Reform Act, an
exemption is requested.

The UAS operated will have a gross weight less than 55 pounds and will be flown at speeds less
than 87 knots (100 miles per hour). It will not carry a pilot or passengers, or flammable fuels and
will be operated in well-defined locations using a PIC and aVO. All operations will be conducted
in compliance with the limitations and conditions stated in this petition for exemption.

The characteristics and conditions under which the UAS will be operated, as outlined in this
petition, given the size, weight, speed, operation capability and proximity to airports and
populated areas, achieve or exceed the equivalent level of safety over a manned aircraft with an
airworthiness certificate used for the purposes outlined in this petition.

                                                           9/13
         B. Title 14 CFR Parts 45.23(b) and 45.27(a): Aircraft Marking and
          Identification Requirements

GGI seeks an exemption from the aircraft marking and identification requirements contained in
Title 14 CFR Parts 45.23(b) and 45.27(a). In a previous grant of exemption, the FAA determined
that exemption from these requirements was warranted, under the following conditions: the
aircraft shall "have identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 C.F.R Part 45,

Subpart C ifthe markings are as large as practicable." FAA Docket No. FAA-2014-0352.

          C. Title 14 CFR Parts 61.113(a) and (b): Private Pilot Privileges and
          Limitations: Pilot in Command

GGI seeks exemption from Title 14 CFR Parts 61.113(a) and (b) which restricts private pilot
certificate holders from flying aircraft for compensation or hire and would also require a Class II
medical certificate. The purpose of Part 61 is to ensure that the skill and competency of any PIC
matches the airspace in which the PIC will be operating, as well as requiring certifications if the
private pilot is carrying passengers or cargo for hire. In this case, while the UAS will be operated
as part of a commercial operation, it carries neither passengers nor cargo.

In the Grant of Exemption to Astraeus Aerial, the FAA determined that the unique characteristics
ofUAS operation outside of controlled airspace did not warrant the addition cost and restrictions
attendant with requiring a the PIC to have a Commercial Pilot Certificate and Class II medical
certificate. The fulfillment of the additional requirements for a private pilot to become qualified
as a commercial pilot would not lead to any additional safety benefits when UAS operations are
involved. Furthermore, while helpful, a pilot license will not ensure remote control piloting skills.
The risks associated with the operation of small UAS are far less than the risks associated with
the commercial activities outlined in Title 14 CFR Parts 61.113 (a) and (b).

         D. Title 14 CFR Part 91.7(a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

GGI seeks an exemption from Title 14 CFR Part 91.7(a), which requires that a civil aircraft be in
airworthy condition to be operated. The FAA has stated that no exemption is required for Title 14
CFR Part 91.7(a) to the extent that the requirements ofPart 21 are waived or found inapplicable.
See Docket No. FAA-2014-0352 at 13-14, 22.

         E. Title 14 CFR Part 91.9(b)(2) and (c): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the
         Aircraft

GGI seeks exemption from Title 14 CFR Part 91.9(b)(2) and (c). Given the small size and
configuration of the UAS, it would be impossible to keep airworthiness documents and other
aircraft manuals on board because there is simply no room, and the UAS has no cabin or cockpit.

The UAS flight manual, registration certificate, and other documentation will be kept at the
control station with the operator during flight. This alternate method constitutes full compliance
with the regulations.

                                    F. Title 14 CFR Part 91.103: Preflight Action

                       GGI seeks an exemption from Title 14 CFR Part 91.103, which requires the PIC to become
                       familiar with specific information before each flight, including information contained in the
                       FAA-approved Flight Manual on board the aircraft.

                       The PIC will review information prior to flight to maintain the safety of the operation, including
                       but not limited to, the weather, battery levels, landing and takeoff distances, and aircraft
                       performance data. The PIC will refer to the manufacturer supplied UAS manual and GGI Flight
                       Operations Manual for technical data and information as provided. The manual will be kept at the
                       GCS during operations.

                       While the PIC will be familiar with all information necessary to safely conduct the flight, an
                       exemption is requested to the extent that an FAA-approved Flight Manual is required.

                                    G. Title 14 CFR Part 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

                       GGI seeks an exemption from the minimum safe altitude requirements of Title 14 CFR Part
lr 91.119. This section prescribes the minimum safe altitudes under which aircraft may not operate,

                       including 500 feet above the surface and away from any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure in
                       non-congested areas. See Title 14 CFR Part 14 C.F.R. 91.119(c).

                       Title 14 CFR Part 91.119(d) allows for a helicopter to operate at less than those minimum
                       altitudes when it can be operated "without hazard to persons or property on the surface" provided
                       that "each person operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically
                       prescribed for helicopters by the FAA." An exemption is required because the proposed UAS
                       operations will occur below 400 feet AGL. Additionally, due the nature of the proposed
                       operations, the PIC and/or VO may need to be Jess than 500 feet away from the UAS.

                       The UAS operated by GGI are far smaller than manned aircraft, such as rotorcraft and fixed
                       winged aircraft. Additionally, the UAS do not carry a pilot or passengers, weigh less than 55
                       pounds, do not carry flammable fuel, will not exceed 87 knots (100 mph), and it will not be
                       operated over non-participating persons. The UAS will be operated below 400 feet AGL with the
                       use of a PIC and aVO to avoid risk to aircraft, persons and property. This provides an equivalent
                       or greater level of safety than achieved with conventional aircraft currently performing similar
                       operations.

                                    H. Title 14 CFR Part 91.121: Altimeter Settings

                       GGI seeks an exemption from Title 14 CFR Part 91.121, which requires a person operating an
                       aircraft to maintain cruising altitude or flight level by reference to an altimeter that is set to the
                       elevation of the departure airport or barometric pressure. An exemption is required to the extent
                       that the UASs do not have a barometric altimeter but rather GPS altitude display.

                       The operator will confirm the elevation of the launch site prior to launch. This will be compared
                       to the GPS sensor or barometric sensor derived altitude as displayed on the UAS reading at the
                       GCS. The operator will then determine the maximum permissible altitude to maintain flight
                       below 400 feet AGL and will not exceed this altitude. The maximum permissible altitude will
                       also be monitored and estimated by visual means through the use of the PIC and VO. This
                       provides a level a safety equal to or exceeding the regulation.

                                                                                 11 I 13
         I. Title 14 CFR Part 91.151(a)(1): Fuel Requirements for Flight in Visual
         Flight Rules Conditions

GGI seeks an exemption from Title 14 CFR Part 91.151(a)(l): Fuel Requirements for Flight in
Visual Flight Rules ("VFR") Conditions. The technological limitations on UAS battery power
means that no meaningful flight operations can be conducted while still maintaining a 30-minute
battery reserve. An exemption from the fuel requirements of Title 14 CFR Part 91.151(a) is
therefore required.

The UAS flight will be terminated with at least 20% reserve power. This allows the UAS to
return to its landing zone with adequate power remaining to conduct a safe and controlled
landing. Given the UAS's size, weight, and speed, the UAS when operated with this limitation
provides an equivalent or greater level of safety than manned aircraft represented by this
regulation.

         ]. Title 14 CFR Parts 91.203(a) and (b): Civil Aircraft: Certifications
         Required

Title 14 CFR Part 91.203(a) states that: "No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has[. ..]
an appropriate and current airworthiness certificate." Furthermore, Title 14 CFR Parts 91.203(b)
states that: "No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required
by paragraph (a) ofthis section or a specialflight authorization issued under §91. 715 is
displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew."

In regard to Title 14 CFR Part 91.203(a), an equivalent level of safety is achieved through the
methods and characteristics as outlined in the request for exemption from Title 14 CFR Part 21,
Subpart H.

In regard to Title 14 CFR Part 91.203 (b), the UAS does not carry a pilot or passengers, does not
have a cabin or cockpit entrance, and does not have on-board storage in which to carry
certification and registration documents. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by
maintaining the proper documentation at the GCS readily available. This alternate method
constitutes full compliance with the regulations.

         K. Title 14 CFR Parts 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1}, 91.409(a)(1} and (2),
          91.417(a) and (b): Maintenance and Inspections

GGI seeks an exemption from the maintenance inspection requirements contained in Title 14
CFR Parts 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(l) and (2), 91.417(a) and (b). These regulations specify
maintenance and inspection standards in reference to Title 14 CFR Part 43. An exemption from
these regulations is needed because Part 43 and these sections only apply to aircraft with an
airworthiness certificate, which the UAS to be operated under this grant of exemption will not
have.

The UAS will be maintained and inspected in accordance with the manufacturer~supplied manual
and GGI UAS Pre-Flight & Maintenance Operations Log. This includes maintenance, overhaul,
replacement and inspection requirements for the UAS. The PIC, prior to the first flight of the day
and as deemed necessary otherwise, will undertake preflight inspection procedures in order to
ensure the UAS is in a condition for safe operation. Discrepancies that may affect the safety of
flight will be addressed and repaired if required. The PIC and GGI will maintain the UAS in a
condition for safe operation.

                                                           12 I 13
- ,i

                           Given the size, characteristics, and operating limitations of UAS as described herein, this
                           provides a level of safety equivalent to or greater than manned aircraft performing similar
                           operations.
                          VIII. PRIVACY
                           GGI's UAS operations will be conducted in accordance with applicable federal, state, or local
                           laws regarding privacy. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access
                           property with permission from the land/building owner/controller or authorized representative.
                           Permission from land owner/controller or authorized representative will be obtained for each
                           flight to be conducted. Notification of inspection activities (including UAS operations) will be
                           delivered via land/building owner/controller or authorized representative a minimum of24 hours
                           prior to inspection day/UAS operations.

                                                                                     13 /13
