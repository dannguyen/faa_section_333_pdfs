                                                           Exemption No. 11452
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0233

Mr. Edward Youn
Owner
Jason Youn Photography, LLC
2342 West 8th Avenue
Mesa, AZ 85202

Dear Mr. Youn:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated January 22, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Jason Youn Photography, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial videography and cinematography, mapping, and enhance academic community
awareness.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom Vision 2 Plus+, DJI S900, and DJI
Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21 and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Jason Youn Photography, LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Jason Youn Photography, LLCis hereafter referred to as
the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom
         Vision 2 Plus+, DJI S900, and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds
         including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
         petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
                                                                                                            4

    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
                                                                                                            5

    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.

AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

Thursday, January 22, 2015

U. S. Department of Transportation Docket Management System
1200 New Jersey Ave, SE Washington, DC 20590

Re: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act of the Federal Aviation Regulations from 14 C.F.R.

45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. Part 21; 14 C.F.R. 61.113(a)&(b); 91.7(a); 91.9(b) (2); 91.103(b); 91.109; 119.121; 91.151(a);
91.203(a)&(b); 91.405(a); 91.407(a) (1); 91.409(a) (2); 91.417(a)&(b)

Dear Sir or Madam,

I, Edward Youn, an FAA licensed pilot, am writing pursuant to the FAA Modernization
and Reform Act of 2012 and the procedures contained within 14 C.F.R. 11, to request
that Edward Youn, an owner and operator of small unmanned aircraft, be exempted
from the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") listed below so that I, Edward Youn, may
operate my small ultra light weight unmanned aircraft system ("UAS") commercially in
airspace regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA").

As described herein I, Edward Youn, am an owner of photographic and educational
company, Jason Youn Photography LLC, within the State of Arizona; experienced in
flying hobby helicopters and aircraft for recreational purposes. I Edward Youn hold an
FAA private pilots license Certificate Number 3375315. I have added a hobby grade
quad-1 UAS to my inventory equipped with a small built in board camera with intent for
aerial videography/cinematography, mapping, and to enhance academic community
awareness for those individuals and companies unfamiliar with the geographical layout
of the metro Phoenix area, and other areas, and augment the business of Jason Youn
Photography LLC with both Video and Still images; following exemption and approval by
the FAA. Thereby enhancing their academic research experience for the metro Phoenix
area, and other areas. I plan to add a second or third quad-copter 2 3 to my inventory in
the future with comparable or better safety capabilities.

I, Edward Youn, am an FAA licensed pilot and have flown small aircraft using license
number 3375315 for about fifteen (15) years and have flown small RC electric
helicopters and aircraft for over ten (10) years without incident. Committed to safety with
each flight. My, Edward Youn's, exemption request would permit operation of ultra light
weight, unmanned (piloted by remote control) and comparatively inexpensive UAS(s) in
tightly controlled and limited airspace. Predetermined in areas away from general public,
airports, heliports and vehicular traffic for community videos and photography, and
within property boundaries for individual homeowner real estate listing videos/photos.
Currently, similar lightweight, remote controlled UAS's are legally operated by

1 DJI Phantom Vision 2 Plus + See appendix A for operators Manual

2 DJI S900 or updated derivation thereof or like models

3 DJI Inspire 1

Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

unmonitored amateur hobbyists with no safety plan or controls in place to prevent a
crash. I, Edward Youn, have personally instilled safety protocols and controls4 to avoid
and prevent public hazard, as well as manned aircraft hazards/catastrophe. This will act
to further safety protocols exclusive to lightweight UAS's specific to commercial video
and photography, and mapping usage as I, Edward Youn, record flight data and other
information gained through permitted flight operations to share with the FAA through any
required FAA reports to assist with future protocol and safety regulation.

Granting my, Edward Youn's, request comports with the Secretary of Transportation's
(FAA Administrator's) responsibilities and authority to not only integrate UAS's into the
national airspace system, but to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such
aircraft systems [UAS's] in the national airspace system" under Section 333(c) of the
Reform Act specific to the use of UAS's for real estate/Realtor purposes. Further I,
Edward Youn, will conduct my operations in compliance with the protocols described
herein or as otherwise established by the FAA.

For the reasons stated below I, Edward Youn, respectfully request the grant of an
exemption allowing me to operate ultra light weight, remote controlled UAS's for
academic community awareness to benefit/stimulate attraction to the metro Phoenix
area, and other areas, and to enhance the photographic business offerings of Jason
Youn Photography LLC and to real estate listing videos for homeowners who cannot
afford expensive manned aircraft for the same purpose. All of which will promote local
economic growth through increased employment and increased tax base. All with public
safety in mind.

II. The Specific Sections of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations From
Which Edward Youn Requests Exemption are:

14 CFR 21;
14 C.F.R. 45.23(b);
14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b); 14 C.F.R. 91, et seq.;
14 CFR 407 (a) (1);
14 CFR 409 (a) (2); and, 14 CFR 417 (a) & (b).

III. The Extent of relief Edward Youn seeks and the Reason He Seeks Such Relief:

I, Edward Youn, submit this application in accordance with the Reform Act, 112 P.L. 95
§§ 331-334, seeking relief from any currently applicable FARs operating to prevent me,
Edward Youn, contemplated commercial cinematic, academic and other flight
operations within the national airspace system. The Reform Act in Section 332 provides

Page 2 of 73
Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

for such integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into our national airspace system
as it is in the public's interest to do so. My, Edward Youn's, ultra light weight UAS meets
the definition of "small unmanned aircraft" as defined in Section 331 and therefore the
integration of my ultra light weight UAS is expressly contemplated by the Reform Act. I
would like to operate my ultra light weight UAS prior to the time period by which the
Reform Act requires the FAA to promulgate rules governing such craft. Thereby,
providing direct experience and valuable information for formal regulation that can be
administered uniformly to related UAS aerial video, photography, and topographical
mapping. The Reform Act guides the Secretary in determining the types of UAS's that
may operate safely in our national airspace system. Considerations include: The weight,
size, speed and overall capabilities of the UAS's; Whether the UAS will be operated
near airports or heavily populated areas; and, Whether the UAS will be operated by line
of sight. 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (a). Each of these items reflect in favor of an exemption for
me, Edward Youn. My UAS utilizes four (4) counter-rotating propellers for balance,
control and stability. My UAS is equipped with GPS and auto return safety technology.
Weighing less than five (5) pounds (far below the maximum 55 pound limit); including
camera with gimbal.

I, Edward Youn, consider safety foremost with each flight. My small unmanned aircraft is
designed to hover in place via GPS. Built in safety systems include a GPS mode that
allows my UAS to hover in place when radio controls are released. Further, the software
within my UAS will not allow it to fly within airspace that is near a major airport and this
restricted airspace closely matches "Class B" airspace. To further prevent flying in
restricted airspace or crowded airspace I consult a current sectional before each flight.
When pilot communication is lost, this and future UASs are designed to slowly return to
home and descend to the ground, then automatically shut down operation. I do not
operate my UAS near airports, Hospitals or Police heliports, and do not operate near
areas where general public safety is concern. I am constantly on alert for any manned
aircraft (Police/Medical helicopters, etc.) and prepared to land/abort immediately to the
nearest and safest ground point should a manned aircraft approach my location or I
suspect manned aircraft may approach near my location. My UAS is capable of vertical
and horizontal operations, and are flown only within my line of sight of me, as the
remote control pilot. Utilizing battery power rather than combustible fuels, flights
generally last between ten (10) to twenty (20) minutes, with an altitude under one
hundred fifty (150) feet AGL. I, Edward Youn, utilize a fresh fully charged battery with
each flight as a safety precaution; full flight time limit for each battery is twenty two (22)
to twenty five (25) minutes as tested. I do not operate my UAS at or below manufacture
recommend minimum charge levels for operation; preferring to remain well within a safe
operating range to insure adequate communication between radio control and UAS to
reduce potential for crash, loss of control or hazard. Reserve batteries are at hand with
each exercise to insure replacement for sufficient safe level of operation. I do not taking
risk that may cause a crash, that could create hazard to the public/property/manned
aircraft, and have no desire to lose an investment. I have clocked numerous practice
flights in remote areas as a hobbyist simulating flights for future commercial use to gain
familiarization with the characteristics of this specific UAS's performance under different

Page 3 of 73
Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

temperature and weather conditions. I also practice computerized simulated flights to
maintain adequate skills and response reflex time. All for the sake of safety.

I, Edward Youn, take extreme caution when operating of my UAS/ultra light weight
unmanned aircraft and will not "create a hazard to users of the national airspace system
or the public." 112 P.L. 95 § 333 (b). Given the small size and weight of my UAS it falls
well within Congress's contemplated safety zone when it promulgated the Reform Act
and the corresponding directive to integrate UAS's into the national airspace system.
Edward Youn's UAS, used in hobby flight, has a demonstrable safety record and does
not pose any threat to the general public or national security.

IV. How Edward Youn's Request Will Benefit the Public As A Whole:

Aerial photography and videography for geographical awareness and for real estate
marketing has been around for a long time through manned fixed wing aircraft and
helicopters. For small budget real estate companies and average homeowners the
expense of such aerial videography is cost prohibitive. Only large companies and high
end Realtors or luxury homeowners can afford to absorb such expense. Depriving non-
luxury homeowners and lower budget Realtors from a valuable marketing tool. Manned
aircraft pose a threat to the public through catastrophic crashes like the one the Phoenix
community experienced when two news gathering helicopters sustained a mid air
collision inside the PHX class B subsequently crashing into a popular park, setting fire
to the area, and claiming four lives. Other manned aircraft both fixed wing and
helicopters have made emergency and hard landings within our city limits. These craft
carry combustible fuel that can start life threatening fires. My, Edward Youn's, UAS pose
no such threat since size and lack of combustible fuel alleviates any potential threat to
the public. The low operational altitude minimizes the potential for a mid air collision.

My ultra light weight UAS is battery powered and creates no emissions that can harm
the environment. The consequence of my ultra light weight UAS crashing is far less
than a full size helicopter or fixed wing aircraft; which are heavy, contain combustible
fuel and can cause catastrophic devastation to the public.

Permitting me, Edward Youn, to immediately fly within national air space furthers
economic growth. Granting my exemption request substantially furthers the positive
economic impact for the community and for companies looking to relocate or build in the
Phoenix metro area or other areas as well as individuals looking to relocate for career
advancement through academic and geographical awareness. Both of which serve as a
stimulus to the community.

V. Reasons Why Edward Youn's Exemption Will Not Adversely Affect Safety Or
How The Exemption Will Provide a Level of Safety At Least Equal To Existing
Rule:

My, Edward Youn's, exemption will not adversely affect safety. Quite the contrary, not
only for he reasons stated in section III and IV but also by permitting me, Edward Youn,

Page 4 of 73
Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

to log more flight time in FAA controlled airspace, with communication with the FAA, will
allow me to contribute to the innovation and implementation of new and novel, as of yet
undiscovered safety protocols for UAS operators that can be embraced by the FAA. In
addition I, Edward Youn, submit the following representations of enhancements to
current aerial videography and photography for real estate:

My UAS weighs less than 5 pounds complete with a small ultra light weight high
definition board camera on a stabilizing gimbal;
I only operate my UAS below 400 feet AGL and normally below 100 feet AGL (well
within the 400 foot AGL permissible ceiling set by the FAA Modernization and Reform
Act of 2012);

My current UAS operates for less than 25 minutes per flight;
I land my UAS prior to the manufacturer recommended minimum level of battery power;
I pilot my UAS by line of sight;
My UAS has GPS a flight safety feature whereby it hovers and then slowly lands if
communication with the remote control pilot is lost;
I actively analyze flight data and other sources of information to constantly update and
enhance safety protocols;
I only operate in reasonably safe environments that are strictly controlled, are away
from power lines, elevated lights, airports and densely populated areas;
I conduct extensive pre-flight inspections and protocol, during which safety carries
primary importance;
I always obtain all necessary permissions prior to operation; and,
I have procedures in place to abort flights in the event of safety breaches or potential
danger.

My, Edward Youn's, safety protocols provide a level of safety equal to or exceeding
existing rules. It is important to note that absent the integration of commercial UAS into
our national airspace system, helicopters are the primary means of aerial video and
photography. While the safety record of such helicopters is notable, there have been
local incidents involving loss of life as well as extensive property damage; it is far safer
to operate a battery powered ultra light weight UAS.

First, the potential loss of life is diminished because UAS's carry no people on board
and I only operate my UAS in specific areas away from mass populations. Second,
there is no fuel on board a UAS and thus the potential for fire or explosions is greatly
diminished. Third, the small size and extreme maneuverability of my UAS allow me to
remotely pilot away from and avoid hazards quickly and safely.
Accordingly, my UAS has been experimentally operated for familiarization/competency
and will continue to operate at or above current safety levels.

VI. A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register:

A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14 C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like.

14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for
procurement of necessary airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1).
The size, weight and enclosed operational area of my, Edward Youn's, UAS permits
exemption from Part 21 because my UAS meets (and exceeds) an equivalent level of
safety pursuant to Section 333 of the Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt
aircraft from the airworthiness certificate requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. §
44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act. Both pieces of legislation permit the FAA
to exempt UAS's from the airworthiness certificate requirement in consideration of the
weight, size, speed, maneuverability and proximity to areas such as airports and dense
populations. My, Edward Youn's, current and projected UAS's meet or exceed each of
the elements.

14 C.F.R. 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness
certificate. As no such certificate will be applicable in the form contemplated by the
FARs, this Regulation is inapplicable.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no
on board pilots or passengers, and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is
inapplicable. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a

B.safety/flight manual delineating areas of where safety can be defined. The FAA has previously
issued exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565,
9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 10700 and 32827.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121 regarding altimeter settings is inapplicable insofar as my UAS utilizes
electronic global positioning systems with a barometric sensor.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b) provides for the carrying of civil aircraft certifications and
registrations. They are inapplicable for the same reasons described above. The equivalent level
of safety will be achieved by maintaining any such required certifications and registrations by
me, Edward Youn, or by Jason Youn Photography LLC.

14 C.F.R. § 45.23: Marking of The Aircraft.

Applicable Codes of Federal Regulation require aircraft to be marked according to certain
specifications. My UAS are, by definition, unmanned. They therefore do not have a cabin,
cockpit or pilot station on which to mark certain words or phrases. Further, two-inch lettering is
difficult to place on such small aircraft with dimensions smaller that minimal lettering
requirement. Regardless, I will mark its UASs in the largest possible lettering by placing the
word "EXPERIMENTAL" on its fuselage as required by 14 C.F.R. §45.29 (f) so that I the pilot, or
anyone assisting me as a spotter with the UAV will see the markings. The FAA has previously
issued exemptions to this regulation through Exemptions Nos. 8738, 10167, 10167A and 10700.

14 C.F.R. § 61.113: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: PIC.

Page 6 of 73
Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113 (a) & (b), private pilots are limited to non-commercial
operations. I, Edward Youn, can achieve an equivalent level of safety as achieved by current
Regulations because my UAS does not carry any pilots or passengers. Further, while helpful, a
pilot license will not ensure remote control piloting skills. The risks attended to the operation of
my UAS is far less than the risk levels inherent in the commercial activities outlined in 14 C.F.R.
§ 61, et seq. Thus, allowing me, Edward Youn, to operate my UAS meet and exceed current
safety levels in relation to 14 C.F.R. §61.113 (a) & (b).

14 C.F.R. 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes.

14 C.F.R. § 91.119 prescribes safe altitudes for the operation of civil aircraft. It allows
helicopters to be operated at lower altitudes in certain conditions. My UAS will never operate at
an altitude greater than 400 AGL; I, Edward Youn, will however operate my UAS in safe areas
away from public and traffic, providing a level of safety at least equivalent to or below those in
relation to minimum safe altitudes. Given the size, weight, maneuverability and speed of my
UAS, an equivalent or higher level of safety will be achieved.

14 C.F.R. 91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections.

The above-cited Regulations require, amongst other things, aircraft owners and operators to
"have [the] aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required
inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as
prescribed in part 43 of this chapter. . . ."

These Regulations only apply to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate. They will not,
therefore, apply to my, Edward Youn's, UAS. However, as a safety precaution I inspect my UAS
before and after each flight.

A Summary The FAA May Publish in the Federal Register: A. 14 C.F.R. 21 and 14
C.F.R. 91: Airworthiness Certificates, Manuals and The Like. 14 C.F.R. 21, Subpart H,
entitled Airworthiness Certificates, sets forth requirements for procurement of necessary
airworthiness certificates in relation to FAR § 91.203(a)(1). The size, weight and
enclosed operational area of my UAS permits exemption from Part 21 because my,
Edward Youn's, UAS meets an equivalent level of safety pursuant to Section 333 of the
Reform Act. The FAA is authorized to exempt aircraft from the airworthiness certificate
requirement under both the Act (49 U.S.C. § 44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform

requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft. As there are no pilots or passengers,
and given the size of the UAS's, this Regulation is inapplicable. An equivalent level of
safety will be achieved by maintaining a manual. The FAA has previously issued
exemptions to this regulation in Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565,
9565B, 10167, maintenance program that involves regular software updates and
curative measures for any damaged hardware. Therefore, an equivalent level of safety
will be achieved.

AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

In summary, Edward Youn seeks an exemption from the following Regulations:

14 C.F.R. 21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b); 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113 (a) & (b); 14 C.F.R. §
91.7 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b)(2); 14 C.F.R. § 91.103(b); 14 C.F.R. § 91.109; 14 C.F.R. §
91.119; 14 C.F.R. § 91.121; 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a); 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.203(a) and (b); 14
C.F.R. § 91.405 (a); 14 C.F.R. § 91.407 (a)(1); 14 C.F.R. § 91.409 (a)(2); 14 C.F.R. §
91.409 (a ) (2); and, 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.417 (a) & (b) to commercially operate my, Edward
Youn's, small unmanned vehicle/lightweight unmanned aircraft vehicle in community
awareness and real estate operations, and to develop economic platforms for real
estate and to provide topographical mapping services. Currently, area awareness and
real estate aerial videography/photography relies primarily on the use of larger aircraft
running on combustible fuel. Posing potential risk to the public. Or it relies on the use of
maverick pilots flying with little knowledge of airspace, aerodynamics, or aviation law.
Granting my, Edward Youn's, a licensed pilot, request for exemption will reduce current
risk levels and thereby enhance safety. My UAS craft(s) do not contain potentially
explosive fuel, is smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than conventional video and
photographic aircraft, and has built in autonomy including no fly zones, altitude
limitation, and return to home features, to improve safety. Further, I operate at lower
altitudes and in controlled airspace eliminating potential public risk flying to and from
established air fields. I, Edward Youn, have been informally analyzing flight information
and will compile safety protocols and the implementation of a flight operations manual
for photographic usage that exceeds currently accepted means and methods for safe
flight. Formal collection of information shared with the FAA will enhance the FAA's
internal efforts to establish protocols for complying with the FAA Modernization and
Reform Act of 2012. There are no personnel on board my, Edward Youn's, UAS(s) and
therefore the likelihood of death or serious bodily injury is significantly diminished. My,
Edward Youn's, operation of my UAS(s), weighing less than 55 pounds and traveling at
lower speeds within limited areas will provide an equivalent level of safety as that
achieved under current FARs. Accordingly I, Edward Youn, respectfully request that the
FAA grant my exemption request and am willing to cooperate in sharing information to
benefit the FAA, safety of manned aircraft, and the general public at large.

(1) When the battery is turned on, do not connect it to or disconnect it from the Phantom.
(2) Charge and discharge the battery completely once every 20 charge/discharge cycles. Discharge the battery until
there is less than 8% power or until it can no longer be turned on, then recharge it to maximum capacity. This power
cycling procedure will optimize the battery.
(3) For long term storage, place the battery with only a 40~50% charge in a strong battery box. Discharge and charge
the battery once every 3 months to keep it in good condition. Charge amount should be varied in these maintenance
charges - (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
(4) Purchase a new battery after your current battery has been discharged over 300 times. Completely discharge a
battery prior to disposal. Please dispose of batteries properly.
(5) Purchase a new battery if your current battery swells up or is damaged in any way.
(6) Never recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
(7) Never charge batteries unattended. Always charge batteries on a non-flammable surface such as concrete and
never near any flammable materials.
(8) Safety is extremely important. For more information, please see the Disclaimer.
Discharging methods:
Slow: Place battery in Phantom and turn on. Leave on until there is less than 8% of power left or until the battery can no longer be turned on. See DJI
VISION App for battery levels. Motors do not need to be turned on, reducing wear.
Fast: Fly the Phantom outdoors until there is less than 8% of power left or until the battery can no longer be turned on.

Flight

Once pre-flight preparation is complete, it is recommended to carry out the tasks in the Phantom Pilot Training Guide to prepare for more complex
flight maneuvers and learn to fly safely. Ensure that all flights are carried out in a suitable location.
Flight Environment Requirements
(1) Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speed exceeding category 4, snow, rain and smog.
(2) Fly in open fields as high buildings or steel structures may affect the accuracy of the onboard compass.
(3) Keep the Phantom away from obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees or bodies of water when in flight. (4) Reduce the chance of
electromagnetic interference by not flying in areas with high levels of electromagnetism,
including base stations or radio transmission towers.
(5) The Phantom cannot operate within the polar areas.
(6) Do not fly the aircraft within no-fly zones specified by local laws and regulations.
Preflight Checklist
(1) Remote Control, smart battery, Range Extender and smartphone are fully charged. (2) Propellers are mounted correctly.
(3) Gimbal clamp has been removed.
(4) Damping absorbers are in good condition, not broken or worn.
(5) Anti-drop kits have been mounted correctly. (6) Camera lens cap has been removed.
(7) Micro-SD card has been inserted if necessary. (8) Gimbal is functioning as normal.
(9) Motors can start and are functioning as normal. (10) DJI VISION App can connect to the camera.
1 Calibrating the Compass
IMPORTANT: Make sure to calibrate the compass in every new flight location. The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference, which
can cause abnormal compass data leading to poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration is required for optimum performance.
DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a chance of strong magnetic interference, such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel
reinforcements underground.
DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular phones.
DO NOT calibrate beside massive metal objects.
1.1Calibration Procedures
Choose an open space to carry out the following procedures. Watch the Phantom 2 Vision+ quick start video for more details.
360°Rotate the aircraft horizontally
Quickly flip the switch S1 Position-1

Calibrating the Compass
Flight
If compass calibration is needed before flight, a prompt will appear on the DJI VISON App's camera page. It will disappear after successful
calibration.
1.2 When to Recalibrate
(1) When compass data is abnormal, the rear LED flight indicator will blink red and yellow.
(2) Flying in different location to last flight.
(3) Mechanical structure of the Phantom has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass. (4) Severe drifting occurs in flight, i.e.
Phantom does not fly in straight lines.
2 Starting/Stopping the Motors
2.1 Starting Motors
A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors instead of simply pushing the stick up. Push both sticks to their bottom corners to
start the motors. Once the motors have spun up, release both sticks simultaneously.
2.2 Stopping Motors
Figure 49
There are two methods to stop the motors.
Method 1: When the Phantom has landed, push the throttle down, then conduct CSC. Motors will stop immediately.
Release both sticks once motors stop.
Method 2: When the aircraft has landed, push the throttle down and hold. Motors will stop after 3 seconds.
Starting/Stopping the Motors / Flight Test
[1] [2]

it is in Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode and will require more careful flight. Execute the CSC command to start motors.
(5) Push the throttle up slowly to take off. Refer to Remote Control Operation (Page 18) for more details.
(6) Shoot photos and videos using the DJI VISION App. Refer to DJI VISION App Usage (Page 32) for more details.
(7) To land, hover over a level surface and gently pull down on the throttle gently to descend.
(8) After landing, execute the CSC command or hold the throttle at its lowest position for 3 seconds or more until the
motors stop.
(9) Turn off the smart battery, Range Extender and Remote Control.
26 © 2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.
When the Rear LED Flight Indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered Failsafe mode. Refer to Failsafe Function(Page 27) for
details.
A low battery level warning is indicated by the Rear LED Flight Indicator blinking red slowly or rapidly during flight. Refer to the Low Battery Level
Warning Function(Page 28) for details.
View tutorials about flight for more flight information:www.dji.com/phantom2visionplus/training.
Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters
(9800 feet) or more above sea level, as battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.

3.2 Video Suggestions and Tips
(1) Work through the check list before each flight.
(2) Set the gimbal working mode to Stabilized.
(3) Aim to shoot when flying in Ready to Fly only.
(4) Always fly in good weather, such as sunny or windless days.
(5) Change camera settings to suit you. These include FOV, photo format and exposure compensation. (6) Take flight tests to establish flight routes
and scenes.
(7) Push the sticks gently to make aircraft movements stable and smooth.

4 Failsafe Function
The Phantom will enter Failsafe mode when its connection to the Remote Control is lost. The Flight Control System will automatically control the
aircraft to return to home and land to prevent injury or damage.
Home Point: When the Phantom enters `Ready to Fly' from the `Ready to Fly status (non-GPS)', the GPS coordinates will be recorded and set as the
home point.
When Remote Control signal is lost, the aircraft will return to the recorded home point coordinates and land. Home point coordinates are used to
calculate the horizontal distance of the aircraft (shown as "Distance" on the GUI of the DJI VISION App).
After successfully record the home point, rear LED flight indicators blink fast green.
Dynamic Home Point: The Home point will be reset to position of the mobile device at specific time intervals.
Enable dynamic home point in DJI Vision app or Phantom 2 Assistant.
Dynamic home point is only available to the GPS-enabled mobile device. Turn on GPS and data service to obtain higher accuracy of the mobile
device position.
Dynamic home point is useful in situations when you are in motion and require a Home point that is different from the takeoff point.

4.1 When Will Failsafe Activate?
(1) The Remote Control is powered off.
(2) The Phantom has flown out of effective remote control range.
(3) The signal between the Remote Control and the Phantom has been blocked. (4) There is interference causing a signal problem with the Remote
Control.

4.2 Failsafe Procedure
Initiating the Failsafe mode from different flying statuses will results in different landing processes.

-Ready to Fly(non-GPS) Automatic landing

The Flight Control System will keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. It may be drift during the descent and landing process.

-Ready to Fly Automatic go home and land

The Flight Control System will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

To ensure the aircraft successful return to home after Failsafe activation, aim to only fly in Ready to Fly mode. The Phantom will automatically descend
during the Failsafe process if there are less than 6 GPS satellites detected for more than 20 seconds.
Aircraft cannot navigate around vertical obstacles on its return home course during Failsafe. However, you can set return home altitude value in
Phantom Assistant to avoid hitting vertical obstacles through DJI Phantom Assistant.
Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the Remote Control from top to bottom 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position as a new home point.
Rear LED flight indicators will blink green rapidly when successful.

3.1 How to solve large margin(s) mid-point error?
If the Remote Control stick(s) mid-point margin of error is too big, the motors will fail to start when you execute the CSC and the Phantom will not take
off. The below are some possible fixes for this.
(1) One of the Remote Control's stick positions (except the throttle stick) is not centered when powering on the Phantom
2 Vision+.
Solution: Place all Remote Control sticks at their mid-point positions and then power cycle the Phantom 2 Vision+ to re-record the mid-point.
(2) The Remote Control sticks have been trimmed, leading to a deviation in the mid-point position.
Solution: Use Assistant to perform a Remote Control calibration.
a) Connect to Assistant, tap Basic -> RC -> Command Sticks Calibration and push all Remote Control sticks through

functions on the second mobile device.
3.11 How to land the aircraft more smoothly?
Solution: First pull the throttle stick position down to lower than 5%, then execute the CSC command to stop the motors.
3.12 Why is the discharge time of a battery not zero when unused?
Solution: A battery aging test is performed prior to delivery which affects the discharge time of the new battery. This is why the discharge time of a
new battery is not zero. The battery is okay to use.
3.13 Do I need extra hardware to utilize ground station?
Solution: No extra hardware is required.
3.14 Does ground station support caching map data offline?
Solution: Yes, user can cache map data in ground station for future use.
3.15 What if I accidently exit DJI Vision App in ground station mode?
If DJI Vision App is closed when aircraft is executing flight mission, aircraft continues with the remaining flight mission.
If DJI Vision App is closed and failed to re-connect with aircraft within 1 minute, aircraft returns home point automatically.

Aircraft

Flight Controller

The Inspire 1's flight controller is based on DJI flight controller with several enhancements such as new flight mode and new safe
mode. Three safe modes are available: Failsafe, Return Home and Dynamic Home Point. These features ensure the safe return of
your aircraft if the control signal is lost. A flight recorder stores crucial flight data for each flight.

Flight Mode

Three flight modes are available. The details of each flight mode are found in the section below:
P mode (Positioning) : P mode works best when GPS signal is strong. There are three different states of P mode, which will be
automatically selected by the Inspire 1 depending on GPS signal strength and Vision Positioning sensors:
P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both are available, and the aircraft is using GPS for positioning. P-OPTI: Vision Positioning is
available but the GPS signal is not. Aircraft is using only Vision Positioning for hovering
P-ATTI: Neither GPS or Vision Positioning available, aircraft is using only its barometer for positioning, so only altitude is controlled.
A mode (Attitude): The GPS and Vision Positioning System is not used for holding position. The aircraft only uses its barometer to
maintain altitude. If it is still receiving a GPS signal, the aircraft can automatically return home if the Remote Controller signal is lost
and if the Home Point has been recorded successfully. F mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this
mode. For more information about IOC, refer to the IOC in Appendix.
Use the Flight Controller mode switch to change the flight mode of the aircraft, refer to the "Flight Mode Switch" on P27 for more
information.

Flight Status Indicator

The INSPIRE 1 comes with the Front LED, Rear LED and Aircraft Status Indicator. The positions of these LEDs are shown in the
figure below:

Aircraft Status Indicator
Front LED Rear LED

The Front and Rear LED show the orientation of the aircraft. The Front LED displays solid red and the Rear LED displays solid
green.

Home Point
Smart RTH
The Home Point is the location at which your aircraft takes off when the GPS signal is strong. You can view the GPS signal strength
through the GPS icon ( ). If you are using the Dynamic Home Point setting, the Home Point will be updated to your current
position as you move around and when the Aircraft Status Indicator blinks green.
GPS
Description
Using the RTH button on the remote controller (refer to "RTH button" on P28 for more information) or the RTH button in the DJI Pilot
app when GPS is available to enables smart RTH. The aircraft return to the latest recorded Home Point, you may control the
aircraft's orientation to avoid collision during the Smart RTH. Press the Smart RTH button once to start the process, press the Smart
RTH button again to exit Smart RTH and regain the control.

INSPIRE 1 User Manual Low Battery RTH
The low battery level failsafe is triggered when the DJI Intelligent Flight Battery is depleted to a point that may affect the safe return
of the aircraft. Users are advised to return home or land the aircraft immediately when these warnings are shown. DJI Pilot app will
advise user to return the aircraft to the Home Point when low battery warning is triggered. Aircraft will automatically return to the
Home Point if no action is taken after 10 seconds countdown. User can cancel the RTH by pressing once on the RTH button. The
thresholds for these warnings are automatically determined based on the current aircraft altitude and its distance from the Home
Point.
Aircraft will land automatically if the current battery level can only support the aircraft to land to the ground from the current
altitude. User can use the remote controller to control the aircraft's orientation during the landing process.
The Battery Level Indicator is displayed in the DJI Pilot app, and is described below

When the critical battery level warning activates and the aircraft is descending to land automatically, you may push the throttle

upward to hover the aircraft and navigate it to a more appropriate location for landing.

Color zones and markers on the battery level indicator reflect estimated remaining flight time and are adjusted automatically,

according to the aircraft's current status.

Failsafe RTH

Failsafe RTH is activated automatically if remote controller signal (including video relay signal) is lost for more than 3 seconds

provided that Home Point has been successfully recorded and compass is working normally. Return home process may be

interrupted and the operator can regain control over the aircraft if a remote controller signal is resumed.

Vision Positioning System

DJI Vision Positioning is a positioning system that uses ultrasonic and image data to help the aircraft identify its current position.
With the help of Vision Positioning, your Inspire 1 can hover in place more precisely and fly indoors or in other environments where
there is no GPS signal available. The main components of DJI Vision Positioning are located on the bottom of your Inspire 1,
including [1]two sonar sensors and[2]one monocular camera.
Aircraft
Using Vision Positioning

[1]

Vision Positioning is activated automatically when the Inspire 1 is powered on. No manual action is required. Vision Positioning is
typically used in the indoor environment where no GPS is available. By using the sensors on the Vision Positioning system, Inspire
1 can perform precision hovering even when no GPS is available.
16 © 2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.

[2]

INSPIRE 1
User Manual
Follow the steps below to use Vision Positioning:

1. Toggle the switch to "P" as shown the figure to the right:

Page 40 of 73
Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

2. Place the Inspire 1 on a flat surface. Notice that the Vision Positioning system
cannot work properly on surfaces without pattern variations.
3. Power on the Inspire 1. The aircraft status indicator will flash twice in green light, which indicates the Vision Positioning system is
ready. Gently push the throttle up
to lift off, and the Inspire 1 will hover in place.
The performance of your Inspire 1's Vision Positioning System is subject to the surface you are flying over. The ultrasonic waves
may not be able to accurately measure the distance over sound absorbing materials, and the camera may not function correctly in
suboptimal environments. The aircraft will switch from "P" mode to "A" mode automatically if both GPS and Vision Positioning
System are not available. So operate the aircraft cautiously when in any of the following situations:
Flying over monochrome surfaces (e.g. pure black, pure white, pure red, pure green). Flying over a highly reflective surfaces.
Flying at high speeds(over 8m/s at 2 meters or over 4m/s at 1 meter).
Flying over water or transparent surfaces.
Flying over moving surfaces or objects.
Flying in an area where the lighting changes frequently or drastically.
Flying over extremely dark (lux < 10) or bright (lux > 100,000) surfaces.
Flying over surfaces that can absorb sound waves (e.g. thick carpet).
Flying over surfaces without clear patterns or texture.
Flying over surfaces with identical repeating patterns or textures (e.g. tiles with same design). Flying over inclined surfaces that will
deflect sound waves away from the aircraft.
Keep the sensors clean at all times. Dirt or other debris may adversely affect the effectiveness of the sensors.
The effective hovering altitudes of the aircraft is from 0 to 2.5 meters.
Vision Positioning system may not function properly when the aircraft is flying over water. Vision Positioning system may not be
able to recognize pattern on the ground in low light conditions (less than 100lux).
Do not use other ultrasonic devices with frequency of 40 KHz when Vision Positioning system is in operation.
Vision Positioning system may not be able to stabilize the aircraft when flying close to the ground (below 0.5 meters) in fast speed.
Keep the animals away from the aircraft when Vision Positioning system is activated. The sonar sensor emits high frequency sound
that is only audible to some animals.

Flight Recorder

Flight data is automatically recorded to the SD card. This includes flight duration, orientation, distance, aircraft status information,
speed, and other parameters.

Attaching and Detaching the Propellers

Use only DJI approved propellers with your Inspire 1. The grey or black nut on the propeller indicates the rotation direction of the
propeller and where it should be attached. To attach the propellers properly, match the nut with the dots on the motors of your

F Fmode A Amode P Pmode
AP
P mode (Positioning) : P mode works best when GPS signal is strong. There are three different states of P mode, which will be
automatically selected by the Inspire 1 depending on GPS signal strength and Vision Positioning sensors:
P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both are available, and the aircraft is using GPS for positioning. P-OPTI: Vision Positioning is
available but the GPS signal is not. Aircraft is using only Vision Positioning for hovering
P-ATTI: Neither GPS or Vision Positioning available, aircraft is using only its barometer for positioning, so only altitude is controlled.
A mode (Attitude): The GPS and Vision Positioning System is not used for holding position. The aircraft only uses its barometer to
maintain altitude. If it is still receiving a GPS signal, the aircraft can automatically return home if the Remote Controller signal is lost
and if the Home Point has been recorded successfully.
F mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this mode. For more information about IOC, refer to the IOC
in Appendix.

Flight

Once pre-flight preparation is complete, it is recommended to use the flight simulator to learn how to fly safely. Ensure that all
flights are carried out in a suitable location.

Flight Environment Requirements

1. Do not use the aircraft in severe weather conditions. These include wind speed exceeding 10m/s , snow, rain and smog.
2. Only fly in open areas. Tall buildings and steel structures may affect the accuracy of the on-board compass and GPS signal.
3. Avoid from obstacles, crowds, high voltage power lines, trees or bodies of water.
4. Minimize electromagnetic interference by not flying in area with high levels of electromagnetism,
including mobile phone base stations or radio transmission towers.
5. Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environment factor such as air density and temperature.
Be very careful when flying 14700 feet (4500 meters) or more above sea level as battery and aircraft
performance may be reduced.
6. The Inspire 1 cannot operate within the polar areas in "P" mode.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to calibrate the compass in every new flight location. The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic
interference, which can cause abnormal compass data leading to poor flight performance or even failure. Regular calibration is
required for optimum performance.
DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a chance of strong magnetic interference, such as magnetite, parking structures,
and steel reinforcements underground.
DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular phones.
DO NOT calibrate beside massive metal objects.
Calibration Procedures
Choose an open space to carry out the following procedures.
1. Ensure the compass is calibrated. If you did not calibrate the compass in the Checklist, or if you
have changed your position since last calibrating it, tap "MODE" in the app and select "Compass
Calibration" to calibrate the compass. Then follow the on-screen instructions.
2. Hold and rotate the aircraft horizontally 360 degrees, and the Aircraft Status Indicator will display a

AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

If the transmitter switch has a FailSafe function, set the FailSafe value to the [Lower] position. This ensures that the landing gear will
lower automatically when the receiver enters FailSafe mode.
To avoid accidental switch triggering, slide levers or other controls can be used for landing gear control.
Usage procedures
1. Ensure transmitter and receiver batteries are fully charged.
2. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position, and then turn on the transmitter.
3. Ensure the "R", "L" and "IN" connections are correct.
4. Ensure the landing gear is in the [Lower] position, then power on the system. If a solid green LED on the
landing gear control board lights up, everything is normal. If it flashes green slowly, re-calibrate the system
according to instructions in "Recalibrating Servo Travel".
5. Toggle the switch to the [Upper] position ONLY AFTER takeoff. 6. Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position for landing.
18 © 2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.
Servo power will shut off 3 seconds after the landing gear has reached its target position.
When powering on the system, if the transmitter switch is in the [Upper] position, the LED will flash red quickly as a warning.
Toggle the switch to the [Lower] position to continue.
If there is an abnormal signal or no signal input into the "IN" port, the LED will slowly flash red. Check receiver and connections for
problems.
If servo power consumption is too high, the LED will light up red. If this lasts more than 4 seconds, the landing gear will lower and
the LED will flash green slowly. Re-calibration is needed before flying.
A2 flight control system users can use the A2 Assistant to set intelligent gear on the "Advanced" page. Refer to the "A2 user
manual" for details.

Remounting the Propellers Instructions

1. Use two M3×12.3 screws and four washers to remount propellers. 2. Apply thread locker to the thread of the propellers mount
first.
3. Affix screws with 4Kg  cm (0.4N  m) torque.

Page 69 of 73
Edward Youn, owner of Jason Youn Photography LLC Phoenix
AZ - Section 333 Exemption Petition

Refer to original screw tensions if you are unfamiliar with torque measurements. Applying thread locker to the propeller mount first
avoids getting thread locker into the holes of the plastic propeller.
Loose screws cannot be securely locked with thread locker.

FAQ

Propeller Precautions

Torque markers on the screws and propeller covers will give you a visual cue to check whether the propellers are loose. Check the
torque markers before every flight.
24 © 2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved.

Using the Propeller Holder Instructions

1. Insert the propeller blades into the propeller holder. 2. Attach the propeller holder to the frame arm.

Assembling Motor Vibration Absorbers

A soft damper is part of the vibration absorber. Assemble soft dampers as shown below. Assembly is the same for CCW and CW
propellers.
Ensure all soft dampers and vibration absorbers are in good condition before every flight. If not, replace immediately. Otherwise,
the flight performance of your aircraft will be adversely affected. Before installing the soft dampers, put the copper gaskets onto
the four mounting holes on the carbon plate. Then put the soft dampers into the mounting holes.
After tightening the screws, the vibration absorbers may be twisted. If this is the case, hold the motor with your thumbs under the
base plate and fingers on the top carbon plate, and squeeze the plates together to make the vibration absorbers flat and parallel
with the plates.

1. Keep your hands away from all moving parts.
2. Ensure the "R", "L" and "IN" connections are correct.
3. Keep the whole aircraft off of the ground during calibration, as landing gear will move.
4. Press and hold the SET button using a pin while powering on, then release. An LED will flash yellow
quickly. Press the SET button again. Auto calibration will begin and the LED will flash yellow slowly. DO
NOT obstruct any moving parts during auto calibration.
5. During calibration, the left landing gear will raise and lower, followed by the right landing gear.
6. After calibration, both the left and right landing gears will be lowered and the LED will display a solid green
light. This indicates that the landing gear is working properly.
If the LED is solid yellow after calibration, a problem has occurred. Carry out the instructions in "Remounting the Landing Gear
Servo" then try again.
Avoid obstructions during calibration. If the landing gear was obstructed, recalibration will be required, per the above steps.
If the "R" and "L" servo cables are reversed, travel will not be measured correctly. Fix the connections and recalibrate the landing
gear using the above steps.
Landing gear travel has been pre-calibrated. Mechanical adjustment of the gear travel is not recommended.
