                                                           Exemption No. 12529
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAAГ2015Г1208

Mr. James M. Finch
J Finch Photography
9571 Ridgewood Court
Bloomington, IL 61705

Dear Mr. Finch:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 12, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of J Finch Photography (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography, cinematography, videography, mapping, crop surveying, inspections, and other
flight operations.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. Д 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, J Finch Photography is granted an exemption from
14 CFR ДД 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, J Finch Photography is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
                                                                                                            4

    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR Д 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
                                                                                                            5

    14 CFR Д 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR Д 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR Д 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR ДД 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
              and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those

Dear Sir or Madam,

In accordance with the FAAs Guidelines for Submitting a Petition for Exemption under section
333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, I James M. Finch, referred to hereafter
as the petitioner, request exemption from the following sections of Title 14, Code of Federal
RegulationsДД 61.113(a); 61.113(b); 91.119(c); 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1);

91.409 (a)(1); 91.409(a)(2); 91.417(a) & (b);

In order to operate small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) commercially in airspace
regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the purposes of aerial photography,
cinematography, videography, mapping, crop surveying, inspections and other flight
operations that could be performed safely and cost effectively with the use of small UAS at
low altitude within the U.S. national airspace. Operations will be performed only at the request
of and with the authorization and permission of clients or their authorized agents in order to
facilitate commerce and raise awareness of the beneficial uses of small unmanned air
systems. So long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined
herein or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333. The conditions
identified and proposed by the petitioner are drawn from references 1-3.

The Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs)
The petitioner seeks exemption from the above mentioned FARs for the following reasons;
61.113(a) & (b); the petitioner requests relief in order to facilitate the utilization of pilots, who
hold a PRIVATE PILOT (or greater) certificate. Any pilots operating under this exemption
would be required to comply with any conditions as set forth and in a similar fashion to the
previously granted exemptions.
91.119(c) As discussed in Exemption 11138 (DOUGLAS TRUDEAU), operations conducted
closer than 500 feet to the ground may require that the small UAS be operated closer than
500 feet to essential persons, or objects that would not be possible without additional relief.
The petitioner requests modification, waiver or exemption and clarification concerning the
terms "congested areas" and "densely populated". The petitioner requests waiver for this
condition to allow reasonable and responsible operations in areas of subdivisions and
neighborhoods if required.
91.121 As discussed in Exemption 11138 (DOUGLAS TRUDEAU) is inapplicable since the
small UAS does not have an altimeter and instead utilizes electronic GPS with a barometric
sensor for altitude information.
91.151(a) As discussed in Exemption 11136 (ADVANCED AVIATION SOLUTIONS LLC) prior
relief has been granted for manned aircraft to operate at less than the prescribed minimums,
including Exemption Nos. 2689, 5745, and 10650. In addition, similar UAS-specific relief has
been granted in Exemption Nos. 8811, 10808, and 10673 for daytime, VFR conditions. The
UAS provides battery power remaining in percent to the PIC. The small UAS batteries provide
approximately 25 minutes of powered flight. Information provided in the operating documents
discusses procedures regarding remaining battery power management. Those documents
contain a condition in which the PIC will initiate a landing procedure when battery remaining
reaches a specified level. Beyond that, the petitioner's small UAS initiates a "Go Home" (to
the flight's origination point) when battery level drops to the "Low Battery" level. Given the
limitations on proposed operations and the location of those proposed operations, The FAA
found that a reduced minimum power reserve for flight in daytime VFR conditions was
reasonable.
91.405(a); 91.407(a)(1); 91.409 (a)(1) & (2); 91.417(a) & (b) As discussed in Exemption
11138 (DOUGLAS TRUDEAU), The petitioner proposes to inspect and ensure that the small
UAS is in a condition for safe flight in accordance with the operating documents. The FAA
found that adherence to the petitioner's operating documents and the conditions and
limitations specified, describing the requirements for maintenance, inspection, and record
keeping, were sufficient to ensure that safety would not be adversely affected. In addition,
the petitioner's own experience as an FAA licensed airframe and powerplant mechanic
qualifies him to determine his craft's airworthiness.

The Petitioner's small UAS
The DJI Phantom 2 vision plus is a highly successful consumer grade small rotorcraft in the
quadcopter configuration with an advertised weight of less than 44 Ounces (1242g) designed
primarily to carry aloft a high definition camera. It has an advertised maximum speed of less
than 30 knots (15m/s) and a maximum climb rate of less than 1200 feet per minute (6 m/s). It
is powered by four electric motors with a distance between motors of less than 14 inches
(350mm) It utilizes an internal inertial measuring unit (IMU) with integrated barometric sensor
augmented with global positioning system (GPS) to maintain its geospatial orientation and
position. It is controlled primarily through an FCC certified radio control (RC) unit. Real time
video and telemetry information is transmitted back to a ground control station allowing the
operator and/or PIC to monitor battery level, GPS signal strength, altitude (AGL), distance
from PIC, camera imagery, and control camera angle.

Risk mitigation
The petitioner's small UAS has failsafe modes of operation for either loss of radio control,
GPS signal, or low battery level. Altitude can be limited by the onboard flight controller and
maximum altitude can be programmed by the PIC. Battery life limits flight times to
approximately 25 minutes. The onboard flight controller will warn the pilot via telemetry and
external lighting cues before reaching a low battery state. An automatic termination of flight
and landing will be initiated when the battery reaches a predetermined state. It is anticipated
that flights will usually last less than 10 minutes. More information is available on pages 41-43
of the attached Phantom 2 Vision plus User Manual version 1.8.

Public interest
Use of the UAS in lieu of a manned aircraft would enhance safety and reduce the
environmental impact as compared to similar operations conducted with manned aircraft of
greater proportions, carrying a crew and flammable fuel. Additionally, use of the small SZUAS
in order to facilitate commerce could lead to economic growth. Operations for this petition will
enable service for property owners or their designees seeking an enhanced perspective for
characteristics, amenities, and benefits of their desired photographic subjects that cannot be
displayed through ground level videography/photography. Aerial photography is a valuable
marketing tool that can lead to increased commerce and enhance personal photography.
Crop surveying applications could lead to decreased use of pesticides and fertilizer and
conservation of water as well as increased crop yields and decreased costs. Aerial surveying
and inspections can increase work site efficiency, improve volumetric estimations and reduce
risks. The petitioner will provide clients with photographic data for these purposes on a 'for
hire' basis acting as an independent contractor. Liability insurance will be obtained
commensurate with the granting of this request for exemption. Flight data including UAS flight
time, Control Unit operation time, incident, accident, and details concerning any deviations
from normal operations will be available to FAA for use in collecting data regarding the use of
UAS as part of this application. This data may be submitted to FAA via traditional means, e.g.
COA Monthly Reports, or other means as required.

Conclusion
The petitioner is requesting this exemption for the purposes of news gathering, real estate
and general aerial photography. The petitioner's own market research shows pent up demand
for these services currently exists in the real estate market and other markets are beginning
to emerge. The petitioner is a freelance photographer with clients in need of these services.
A quick internet search demonstrates that many people currently operate similar UAS in
exactly this fashion without, it is assumed, FAA authorization. The petitioner refrains from
engaging in commercial use of the UAS without FAA authorization. The primary purpose of
seeking this exemption is to obtain the capability to offer those services while remaining in
compliance. The petitioner understands the needs of his clients and of the FAA. His
commercial pilot certificate, Airplane Single & Multiengine Land, and Instrument with private
privileges for Glider ensures his knowledge of the airspace in which he will work. His FAA
certification as an Airframe & Powerplant mechanic ensures the small UAV will be properly
maintained and inspected for airworthiness before flight.

Choose between Phantom and Naza-M working modes using Phantom 2 Vision+ Assistant Software. If

using Naza-M mode, please refer to the NAZAиM V2 Quick Start Manual for related instructions.

Phantom: Flight settings will be elected automatically depending on whether 6 or more satellites have

been found. This mode allows users to configure the Remote Controller and gain values, and use Failsafe

and battery level warnings.

Naza-M: Flight settings will be identical to the Naza-M V2. Users can choose between GPS, Attitude, or

Manual mode. They can also access advanced settings including Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC).

Rear LED Flight Indicators will display the flight status according to the Naza-M indicator.

Ready to Fly: When 6 or more GPS satellites have been found, the Flight Control System will lock its

home point and Rear LED Flight Indicators will blink a slow green ( ilil ilil S Ill $).This mode is ideal for

beginners.

Ready to Fly (non-GPS): When less than 6 GPS satellites have been found, the Flight Control System will

stabilize itself less than in full Ready to Fly mode and will require more skilled flying. Rear LED Flight

Indicators will blink a slow yellow (                      ).

11. VVhen the battery is turned on, do not connect it to or disconnect it from the Phantom.
I 2. Charge and discharge the battery completely once every 20 charge/discharge cycles. Discharge the

I battery until there is less than 8% power or until it can no longer be turned on, then recharge it to

maximum capacity. This power cycling procedure will optimize the battery.

3. For long term storage, place the battery with only a 40-50% charge in a strong battery box. Discharge

and charge the battery once every 3 months to keep it in good condition. Charge amount should be

varied in these maintenance charges - (40%-50%}-0░/o-l00%--{40o/o-50%).

4. Purchase a new battery after your current battery has been discharged over 300 times. Completely

discharge a battery prior to disposal. Please dispose of batteries properly.

5. Purchase a new battery if your current battery swells up or is damaged in any way.

6. Never recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.                            1

The Remote Controller Power LED will blink red and sound an alert when the voltage drops below
3.9V and automatically power off after 3 seconds. This process will repeat even if you power cycle the
Remote Controller. If this low voltage warning occurs during flight, it will cause the Phantom to enter
Failsafe mode which cannot be interrupted (refer to Failsafe Function (Page4ll for details). Replacing
batteries immediately after the low voltage warning (3.9V-4.5V) is strongly recommended.

5.4 Antenna Orientation

Keep the antennas pointing skyward, perpendicular to the ground for maximum communication range during flight.

IЕ2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 24
     For maximum range and reliability,
     Remote Controllerи antenna should
     point skywards with no
     obstructions between it and the

5.7 Compliance Version Configuration

As power levels vary between regulators, the Phantom Remote Controller's power output can be adjusted by
twisting the potentiometer knob (Figure 28) on the back of the Remote Controller using a-flathead screwdriver. For
CE compliance, set the Remote Controller to CE with a full counterclockwise turn. For FCC compliance, set the
Remote Controller to FCC with a full clockwise turn. Be sure to follow relevant local regulations.
Compliance can be configured using the PHANTOM RC Assistant Software. Select CE compliance version in
Assistant Software to set it, or do the same with FCC compliance version.

                                                                                     Figure 28

              (1) Turn the potentiometer knob gently to avoid damage.
              (2) CE compliant devices have an effective communication range of 400 meters in open spaces

                       due to power limitations.
              (3) FCC compliant devices have an effective range of 800 meters in open spaces.
              (4) Watch your flight distance as the Phantom 2 Vision+ will enter Failsafe mode (auto-landing or

                       go home and land) if it flies beyond the relevant range limits.
              (5) Always follow local laws and regulations.

6 Preparing the Range Extender

The Phantom 2 Vision+ Range Extender is a wireless communication device that operates within the 2.4 GHz
frequency band.. It "is used to extemling the иeffective range of-communication-between a Smartp-hone and the

Phantom 2 Vision+. In an open, unobstructed area, the transmission distance can reach up to 700 meters. This can

be reduced by trees, buildings and other sources of the same frequency. Before every flight, it is suggested that
you ensure the Range Extender is functioning properly; otherwise communication issues between the mobile device

and the Phantom 2 Vision+ may occur.

Each.Range Extender has a unique MAC-address. and netwo.rk.name.(S.Sll)), details of whlch are printed on the label

as 'Phantom_XXXXXX '. The 'XXXXXX' represents the last 6 letters or numbers of the MAC address for the

Range Extender. This can be renamed in the DJI VISION App.

1 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: M11ke sure to calibrete the c:ompess in every new flight location. The compass is very sensitive to

electromagnetic interference, which can cause abnormal compass data leading to poor flight performance or even

flight failure. Regular calibration is required for optimum performance.

         (1) DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a chance of strong magnetic interference, such as

0             magnetite. parking structures, and steel reinforcements underground.
         (2)  DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular phones.

         (3) DO NOT calibrate beside massive metal objects.

1.1 Calibration Procedures

Choose an open space to carry out the following procedures. Watch the Phantom 2 Vision+ quick start video for

more details.

2 Starting/Stopping the Motors

2.1 Starting Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors instead of simply pushing the stick up. (Figure 50)
Push both sticks to their bottom corners to start the motors. Once the motors have spun up, release both sticks
simultaneously.

                                                                                   Figure 50

2.2 Stopping Motors

There are two methods to stop the motors.
i'1ethod 1: When the Phantom has landed, push the throttle down, then conduct CSC. Jv1otors will stop immediately.
Release both sticks once motors stop.

                                                                                   Figure.51

Jv1ethod 2: When the aircraft has landed, push the throttle down and hold. Jv1otors will stop after 3 seconds.

                                                                                    Figure 52

 0 Do not execute CSC during normal flight. This will stop the motors and cause the aircraft to drop without
           control.

   ~ Conduct the CSC as neatly as you can. Release the sticks once motors start/stop.

4 Failsafe Function

The Phantom will enter Failsafe mode when its connection to the Remote Controller is lost. The Flight Control
System will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to prevent injury or damage.

              Home Point: When the Phantom enters 'Ready to Fly' from the 'Ready to Fly status (non-GPS) ', the
              GPS coordinates will be recorded and set as the home point.
             1) When Remote Controller signal is lost, the aircraft will return to the recorded home point

                      coordinates and land.
             2) Home point coordinates are used to calculate the horizontal distance of the aircraft (shown as

                      "Distance" on the GUI of the DJI VISION App).
             3) After successfully record the home point, rear LED flight indicators blink fast green.

4.1 When will Failsafe Activate?                                                                                   ~

4.2 Failsafe Procedure

Initiating the Failsafe mode from different flying statuses will results in different landing processes.

Ready to Fly (non-GPS) -ииAutomatic landing

Flight Control System will keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. It may be drift during the

and landing process.

Ready to Fly- Automatic go home end land

lrhe Flight Control System will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

The below demonstrates the complete Ready to Fly Failsafe landing process.

1 Record Home Point.                       2 Flying.                              3 Remote controller signellost.

              (1) To ensure the aircraft successful return to home after Failsafe activation, aim to only fly in Ready
                      to Fly mode.

IЕ2014 DJI. All Rights Reserved. 41
              (2) The Phantom will automatically descend during the Failsafe process if there are less than 6 GPS
                       satellites detected for more than 20 seconds.

              (3) The aircraft cannot avoid obstacles during Failsafe.
              Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the Remote Controller from top to bottom 5 times or more will reset
              the current aircraft position as a new home point. Rear LED flight indicators will blink green rapidly
              when successful.

Failsafe on the DJI VISION App
The DJI VISION App will provide information during Failsafe.

5 Low Battery Level Warning Function

The low battery level warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,

users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The Phantom 2 Vision+ has two levels of low

battery level warning. The default battery level warning thresholds are 30% (low battery level warning) and 15%

(critical low battery level warning) respectively.

6 Flight Limits

All unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations as the ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and their own national airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight
limits function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function
includes height, distance limits and No Fly Zones.

In Ready to Fly mode, height, distance limits and No Fly Zones work together to manage flight. In Ready to Fly
(non-GPS} status, only height limits work and flights cannot go higher than 120m.

              Default parameters in Assistant Software are compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by ICAO.

 '4 (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules, make sure to

              configure these parameters to comply with these rules before flying.

6.1 Max Height &Radius Limits

Max Height & Radius limits flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the Phantom 2 Vision+
Assistant (Figure 57). Once complete, your Phantom will fly in a restricted cylinder (Figure 58).

            status and continue for 5 seconds at which point it will switch back to red blinking.
    (2) For safety reasons, please do not fly close to airports, highways, railway stations, railway lines,
            city centers and other special areas. Try to ensure the aircraft is visible.

6.3 Conditions of Flight Limits

In different working modes and flight modes, flight limits will differ according to number of GPS satellites found.

The following table demonstrates all the cases(-./: avaOable; X:unavailable).

All flights are restricted by height, distance and special areas simultaneously. The Failsafe and Ground Station

operations are not restricted to flight limits, but if Ground Station function is used, the flight will be restricted the

special area limits built in to Ground Station. Refer to the Ground Station manual for details.

    make sure you have a good GPS lock by ensuring your LED
    indicators are flashing Green. Fly the Phantom at least 50ft
    away from your take off point. Turn off the Remote Controller.
    The Phantom will enter it's failsafe Return-To-Home Mode.
    Let the Phantom finish it's routine and land itself within 2 meters

    sure you have a good GPS lock by ensuring your LED indicators
    are flashing Green. Fly the Phantom 50ft away from your take
    off point. Turn off the Remote Controller. The Phantom will
