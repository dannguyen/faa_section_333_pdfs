                                                      Exemption No. 11265A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0732

Jonathan E. Adams
Executive Vice President
Strat Aero International, Inc.
On behalf of The City of Roswell Coalition
122 Will Rogers Road, Building 1166
Roswell, NM 88203

Dear Mr. Adams:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated June 5, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of The City of Roswell Coalition (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment
to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an
amendment to add the DJI Spreading Wings S1000

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Discussion of Public Comments:

The FAA received one comment in support of the petition made to the docket.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11265A
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11265A remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Aeryon SkyRanger
         and the DJI Spreading Wings S1000 when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Re: Modification to Exemption Request under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11
of the Federal Aviation Regulations submitted September 19, 2014

Dear Sir or Madam:

Thank you for your approval of the City of Roswell Coalition's 333 Exemption No. 11265.

At this time, on behalf of both the City of Roswell Coalition as the petitioner and for Strat Aero
International Inc. as the sUAS operator for said petitioner, I request an amendment to our exemption to
add the DJI Spreading Wings S1000 sUAS to our approved aircraft. This specific sUAS has been
approved in over 40 granted 333 exemptions to date, and we will submit operating documents to
333exemptionsCaDfaa.gov to further clarify safety and operational features of this aircraft.

This addition to Exemption No. 11265 will not change missions, training, and/or maintenance performed
by City of Roswell Coalition representatives.

Thanks again for your help with approving our request. If you have questions or concerns, please
contact Mr. Jonathan Adams at 518-224-5759.

Best regards,

Tanya Renae Compton
