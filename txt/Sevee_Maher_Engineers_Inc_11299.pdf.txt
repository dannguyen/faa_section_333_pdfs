                                                          Exemption No. 11299
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-1008

Mr. Charles Burnham
Special Projects Coordinator
Sevee & Maher Engineers, Inc.
4 Blanchard Road P.O. Box 85A
Cumberland Center, ME 04021

Dear Mr. Burnham:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated November 19, 20141, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) on behalf of Sevee & Maher Engineers, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct topographic surveys.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

1 On February 27, 2015, the petitioner responded to the FAA's Request for Information.
                                                                                                2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is an Atlantic RC Aircraft LC 047.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. Д 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of

exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or

crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in

addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled

by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

и They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

и The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

и A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Sevee & Maher Engineers, Inc. is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR ДД 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Sevee & Maher Engineers, Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Atlantic RC
    Aircraft LC 047when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
    be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
                                                                                                            4

    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR Д 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR Д 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR Д 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR Д 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
    Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
    as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR ДД 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
              and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those
              who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;
           g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
           h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city,

Docket Operations, M-30
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE.
Room W12-140, West Building Ground Floor
Washington, DC 20590-0001

Dear Administrator,

Sevee & Maher Engineers, Inc. (SME) is an engineering company located iri Cumberland
Center, Maine. We specialize in civil, environmental, geotechnical, water, and compliance. A
large portion of our work depends on topographic information. Current topographic surveys
are performed by small planes using aerial photogrammetry, which is costly and can have
lead times up to several months. Using a small-unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) SME would
be able to quickly and affordably provide our clients with the topography of their properties.
By granting this request, flights consisting of small manned aircrafts would be replaced by
sUAS, resulting in less air traffic. It is also worth noting that the sUAS is powered by batteries,
and would have minimal impact on the environment compared to the planes currently used for
aerial surveys.

The sites that SME wants to map consist of solid waste and industrial landfills, dams, quarries
and gravel pits, and other large open areas. Most landfills are in remote areas, and
operations pose no threat to public safety. Operations are typically up to 13 minutes and
follow a predetermined path to provide the photos necessary for photogeometric analysis.
Each operation ends in the proximity of where it began. A constant elevation (approximately
300 feet above ground level) is maintained. One site may require several operations. The
sUAS will travel no faster than 10 meters per second (mps) and will never operate out of line
of sight.

Granting this request will do nothing more than allow SME to do what thousands of hobbyists
and manufacturers of model aircraft do every day, and we will abide by much stronger safety
measures than currently required for these groups by FAA policies and regulations. In this
petition for exemption, we seek to engage in essentially the same type of sUAS operation that
the FAA would permit us to currently but for the fact that SME is not a hobbyist or
manufacturer of a model aircraft.

(c) The extent of relief we are seeking, and the reason we are seeking the relief

We seek an exemption from several interrelated provisions of 14 C.F.R. Parts 21, 45 and
91 to the extent necessary to engage in commercial operations of sUAS on our clients'
property. We have detailed, below, a set of safeguards that will apply to our sUAS operations
as well as a copy of the Aircraft Flight Manual. Our operations will not "create a hazard to
users of the national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security" and
are thus consistent with the congressional mandate in Section 333 of the FAA Modernization
and Reform Act of 2012, which gives FAA a mechanism to allow certain UAS to operate safely
in the national airspace system.

(d) The reasons why granting our request would be in the public interest that is,
          how it would benefit the public as a whole

As described above, the sUAS will provide timely and affordable topographic survey. The
current use of planes to perform aerial surveys has more significant impact on the
environment (carbon footprint) and air traffic.

(e) The reasons why granting the exemption would not adversely affect safety, or
          how the exemption would provide a level of safety at least equal to that provided
          by the rule from which we are seeking the exemption

          Unmanned Aircraft System
          The UAS proposed is a proprietary design, conceived and constructed by Atlantic RC
          Aircraft, and referred to as the LC 047. This aircraft has four rotors and four motors in
          a quadcopter configuration (X4). Given the size, weight, speed, and limited operating
          area associated with the aircraft to be utilized, an exemption from 14 CFR part 21,
          Subpart H (Airworthiness Certificates), subject to certain conditions and limitations, is
          warranted and meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety under 14 CFR
          part 11 and Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (PL 112-
          95). A UAS operated without an airworthiness certificate in the restricted environment
          and under the conditions and limitations proposed by the petitioner will be at least as
          safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an
          airworthiness certificate issued under 14 CFR part 21, Subpart Hand not subject to
          the proposed conditions and limitations.

          The unmanned aircraft (UA) to be operated under this request is less than 55 lbs. fully
          loaded, flies at a speed of no more than 10 meters per second, carries neither a pilot
          nor passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates
          exclusively within a secured area. In addition, there are integrated safety features into
          the design of the UAS, as described in the petitioner's Aircraft Flight Manual, to ensure
          the safety of persons and property within and surrounding the limited operating area.
          In the event the UAS loses communications or its GPS signal, the UA will have the
          capability to return to a pre-determined location. It will also have the capability to abort
          a flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

          Even though its UAS will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be
         needed from 14 CFR Д 45.23 as the UA will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or
          pilot station on which the word "experimental" can be placed. Given the size of the UA,
          the petitioner notes that the two-inch lettering will be impossible. The petitioner asserts
          that an equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the UA marked with the
         word "experimental" on the fuselage in compliance with 14 CFR Д 45.29(f), in a

Z:\SME\Administration\DRONE\20141119_Drone_Petition.doc
November 19, 2014
Page 3 of 6
          location where the pilot, observer, and others working with the UA will see the
          identification.

          The maintenance requirements in the pertinent sections of 14 CFR part 91 are only
          applicable to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate in accordance with part 43. The
          UAS does not have specific maintenance instructions; therefore, there is a
          documented preflight and postflight maintenance process for the UAS. Any
          manufacturers' recommended instructions and procedures will be followed when those
          procedures exist for certain components of the UAS.

          Pilot In Command (PIC)
          Since the UA will not carry a pilot or passengers on board, the proposed operations will
          not adversely affect safety by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have no.[ghc1]
          pilot license. Since there are no standards for either private or commercial UAS pilot
          certificates, knowledge of airspace regulations and dexterity in the control and
          operation of the UAS acquired from actual operation of the aircraft will be the most
          important factors in establishing an equivalent level of safety. Furthermore, given the
          restricted and controlled airspace within which operations will take place, the key
          factors needed by the PIC are knowledge of the airspace within which the operation
          will take place and how that airspace fits into the National Airspace System (NAS). It
          cannot be assumed that a commercial pilot, approved to operate a helicopter or fixed
          wing aircraft, has the skill or ability to safely operate an unmanned aerial vehicle,
          operating at 400 feet AGL or lower, within strictly controlled pre-approved airspace.
          Additionally, the aircraft will be operated within a secure environment, which no one will
          be allowed to enter unless they are part of the operation, have been fully briefed of the
          risks prior to operation of the UAS, and have consented to the risks associated with
          being in the operating area. Should there be a mishap, the UA being flown pose
          significantly less of a threat than the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft now being
          employed because they are a fraction of the size, carry no flammable fuel, and do not
          carry crew or passengers. This is in stark contrast to conventional aircraft that are
          flown to the site, carry flammable fuel, carry passengers and crew, and operate in a
          much larger area.

          UAS Operating Parameters
          All flights will be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of a pilot and/or observer,
          and that the UA flights will be limited to a maximum altitude of 400 feet AGL. An
          operator will ensure that only consenting personnel will be allowed within 100 feet of
          the UA operation. An equivalent level of safety can be achieved given the size, weight,
          and speed of the UAS, as well as the location where it is operated. The UAS will be
          operated within a safe operating perimeter, the boundaries of which will be determined
          by SME personnel and only participating and consenting personnel will be allowed

          within this perimeter. Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing
          far more than its maximum 55 lb., and the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated
          with the UAS operations is far less than those with conventional aircrafts.

         With respect to preflight actions, an exemption from 14 CFR Д 91.103 may be needed,
          because it will not have approved rotorcraft flight manuals. An equivalent level of
          safety will be achieved by the PIC and one additional operator taking all preflight
          actions as set forth in their Aircraft Flight Manual, including reviewing weather, flight
          battery requirements, landing and takeoff distances, and aircraft performance data
          before initiation of flight. Additionally, a briefing will be conducted prior to each day
          regarding planned UAS operations. With respect to the fuel requirements, the battery
          life of the UAS allows for a 15-minute flight maximum. Which makes meeting the 30
         minute reserve requirements in 14 CFR Д 91.151 not possible for the sUAS. An
          equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 15 minutes or 15% of
          battery power, whichever occurs first.

         An exemption from 14 CFR Д 91.121 will be needed, as the UAS will have a GPS
          altitude read out instead of a barometric altimeter. An equivalent level of safety will be
          achieved, as outlined in the Aircraft Flight Manual. Specifically, the altitude information
          will be provided to the UAS PIC via a digitally encoded telemetric data feed. Prior to
          each flight, a zero altitude initiation point will be established and confirmed for
          accuracy by the PIC.

          Public Interest
          The petitioner states that, given the small size of the UA involved and the restricted
          sterile environment within which it will operate, and due to the size of the UA and the
          restricted areas in which the UAS will operate, approval of the application presents no
          national security issue. Given the clear direction in Section 333, the strong equivalent
          level of safety surrounding the proposed operations, and the significant public benefit,
          including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental impacts, and including reduced
          emissions associated with allowing UAS for survey operations, granting the requested
          exemptions is in the public interest.

          The attached Aircraft Flight Manual (Appendix A) includes specifics on the equipment
          being used.

Step4 Compass Calibration

Without GPS module, please skip this step. If you use with GPS module, follow step-by-step for calibration.

           и  DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is strong magnetic interference, such as
              magnetite, car park, and steel reinforcement under the ground.
0и            DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration, such as keys or cell phones.
              Compass module CANNOT work in the polar circle.
           и

Calibration Procedures

1. Quickly switch the control mode switch from GPS Mode to Manual Mode and back to GPS Mode for 6 to

         10 times. The LED indicator will turn on solid BLUE.
2. Rotate your Multi-rotor around the horizontal axis (about 360░) until the LED changes to solid GREEN,

         and then go to the next step.
3. Hold your Multi-rotor vertically and rotate it (its nose MUST be downward) around the vertical axis (about

         360░) until the LED turns off, meaning the calibration is finished.

  4. The LED indicator will show whether the calibration is successful or not.
             и If the LED keeps WHITE for 3 seconds, meaning the calibration is successful, and then calibration
                       mode will exit automatically.
             и If the LED keeps flashing quickly RED, the calibration has failed. Switch the control mode switch
                       one time to cancel the calibration, and then re-start from step 1.

             1. You don't need to rotate your multi-rotor on a precise horizontal or vertical surface, but keep at

                   least 45и difference between horizontal and vertical calibration.
               2. If you keep having calibration failure, it might suggest that there is very strong magnetic

                  interference around the GPS & Compass module, please avoid flying in this area.
               3. When to do re-calibration.

                   и The flight field is changed.
                   и The multi-rotor mechanical setup has changed, including the following situations:

                    a) If the GPS & Compass module is re-positioned.
                      b) Electronic devices added, removed or re-positioned (Main Controller, servos, batteries, etc).
                      c) When the mechanical structure of the multi-rotor is changed.
                   и If the flight direction appears shifting (meaning the multi-rotor doesn't "fly straight").
                   и The LED indicator often indicates abnormality blinking when the multi-rotor spins. But it is normal

                        for this to happen only occasionally.
                   и LED blinks yellow and green (ri>~) continually, indicating that the compass data is abnormal.

The autopilot system can work in Manual Mode and ATTl. Mode without a GPS module. After connecting to the
GPS module, GPS Mode is available. Follow the bellow steps to enter the different control modes.
l. Use a 3-position switch on the transmitter as mode control switch.
2. Make sure to take off the aircraft in ATTl. Mode in every flight.
3. Hover the Aircraft. Release all joysticks and then flip the control mode switch to the GPS Mode or Manual

         Mode (NOT RECOMMENDED).

Step2 Start & Stop Motor

Star Motor : Pushing throttle stick before takeoff will not start motors. You have to execute any one of following
four Combination Stick Commands (CSC) to start motors

Stop Motor :The default setting of stop motor is Immediately. For the immediately mode, in any control mode, once
motors start and throttle stick is over 10%, motors will stop immediately when throttle stick is back under 10% again.
In this case, if you push the throttle stick over 10% within 5s after motors stop, motors will re-start, CSC is not
needed. If you don't push throttle stick after motors start within 3s, motors will stop automatically.

                 Please refer to the instructions of A1 and A2 in the Advanced Functions section, to learn more about
                 the Control Mode and Stop Motor details.

Setp3 Checking List before Flying

           и Make sure you have assembled your multi-rotor correctly.

        e Make sure you have done the configuration procedure correctly.
        e Make sure all connections are in good condition.

           и Make sure batteries are fully charged for your transmitter, autopilot system and all devices.
           и Any of the following mistakes will lead to a dangerous accident, double check all these items:

                Rotation direction of motor is opposite I Propeller installation mistake I Main controller installation
                mistake I Wrong connection between the main controller and ESC.

           и Always switch on the transmitter first, then power on multi-rotor! (Power off multi-rotor first, then
                    switch off the transmitter after landing!)

           и Make sure the GPS signal is good, only one Red LED blinking or without Red LED blinking.
                    Otherwise multi-rotor will drift without stick commands.
                    When system is powered on, you MUST NOT move your multi-rotor or sticks on transmitter until
                    the system initialization is finished (about 5 second).

    и Please AVOl D using the autopilot system in areas of urban area with crowded buildings, tunnels

                    and under bridges, where GPS signal will be blocked most likely.
                   In ATTI Mode, throttle stick center position is for Omls along the vertical direction. You should
                    keep the position of throttle stick higher than 10% from cut-throttle during the flight!

    и Please do the fly test and gain tuning with ATTl. Mode in the open air without heavy wind!

           и Refer to the indication in the software: Basic->Gain for more details.

       Step4 Flying Procedures

             1. If in GPS Mode, place the aircraft in an open space without buildings or trees. Take off the aircraft after 6 or
                   more GPS satellites are found (RED LED blinks once or no blinking). If in Manual Mode or ATTl. Mode, you
                   can skip this step.

              2. Place the aircraft three meters away from you and others (especially child), to avoid accidental injury.

           3. Start-up

                ../ Switch on the transmitter, and then power on autopilot system! You MUST NOT move your multi-rotor or
                      sticks on transmitter until the system initialization is finished (about 5 second).

                ../ Push both sticks of transmitter to the left bottom or right bottom to start the motors.
                ../ Release the yaw, roll and pitch sticks and keep them at the neutral position, avoiding the aircraft to tilt to

                      one side. At the same time raise the throttle stick from the bottom quickly. The motors will stop if you do
                       not push the throttle stick from the bottom within 3s and you will need to execute the start-up procedure
                       again. When the aircraft is on the point of leaving the ground, continue to push the throttle stick upwards
                      to take off from the ground, pay attention not to push the stick excessively.
                 ./ Pay attention to the aircraft movement at any time when flying, and use the sticks to adjust the aircraft's
                       position. Keep the yaw, roll, pitch and throttle sticks at the neutral position to hover the aircraft at the
                      desired height.

           4. Lower the aircraft slowly. Pull the throttle stick to the bottom and then push the sticks to the left bottom or

                   right bottom to stop the motors after landing. (Also, with throttle stick under 10%, and after landing 3s the
\
) motors will stop automatically)

           5. Power off the autopilot system, and then switch off the transmitter after landing.

0и      DO NOT fly near to any ferromagnetic substances, to avoid strong magnetic interference with
        the GPS. Otherwise, it may cause the aircraft to FailSafe, crack or even fly away.
    и   If abnormal compass data occurs during flying, LED will blink Yellow and Green alternatively
        ( «~ ). If in ATTl and Manual Mode, it is free from influence. In any other control mode, the

..  и   autopilot system will enter into ATTl. Mode automatically; once the compass data goes back to
    и   normal, the autopilot system will regain the original control mode.
    и   If the LED flashes quickly YELLOW then this indicates battery voltage is low, land ASAP.
        It is recommended to land the aircraft slowly, to prevent the aircraft from damage.
    и   If the transmitter indicates low-battery alarm, please land ASAP. In this condition the transmitter
        may cause the aircraft to go out of control or even crash.
        The LED will blink White to indicate huge cumulative yaw errors caused by spinning the craft
        continuously. In this case, you can stop or slow down the spinning, and continue flying after the

и'fи и  White blinking has stopped, so as to have better flight performance.
        If Low-Voltage Alarm is set, the aircraft will act according to the configuration of the Assistant
        Software once Low-Voltage Alarm is triggered.

    и If Fail-Safe function is set, the aircraft will act according to the configuration of the Assistant

        Software once Fail-Safe is triggered.
