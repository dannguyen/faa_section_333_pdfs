                                                      Exemption No. 11399A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0147

Mr. Philip A. K. Stiles, Esquire
President and General Counsel

Lake Mary, FL 32746

Dear Mr. Stiles:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 2, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of GPS Development, LLC dba SkyViewHD (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection1. You requested an amendment to add the DJI Phantom 2 Vision +, DJI Phantom 3,
DJI S1000, and BirdsEyeView Firefly 6.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11399
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11399 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
         DJI Inspire 1, DJI Phantom 2 Vision +, DJI Phantom 3, DJI S1000, and BirdsEyeView
         Firefly 6 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Dear Mr. Williams and the U. S. Department of Transportation:

         On April 20, 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") granted GPS
Development, LLC d/b/a SkyViewHDTM ("SkyViewHD") with an exemption from the Federal

                                                               1

                                 SkyViewHD, 429 S. Keller Road, Suite 310, Orlando, FL 32810
                                           Phone: 407-478-7958www.skyviewhd.com
Aviation Regulations ("FARs") - Exemption No. 11399, Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­
0147. The prior exemption was granted with no posted comments or questions from the FAA.

         SkyViewHD is committed to meticulously working through the exemption process in order
to provide the FAA with an application which is not only thorough and comprehensive but
demonstrates SkyViewHD's professional approach to a very unique industry and we appreciate
this opportunity to submit an additional exemption application for your consideration.

         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, GPS Development, LLC d/b/a SkyViewHD, the developer and
operator of the Small Unmanned Aircraft System ("UA"), seeks an additional exemption from the
FARs as listed and discussed below.

         SkyViewHD's UAs perform precision surveying, inspections, videography, photography,
and training in order to provide services for the following which shall include but not be limited
to: real estate, agriculture, mining, cellular towers, oil and gas flare stacks, power lines,
transmission towers, bridges, dams, general infrastructure inspection, other structures, and other
forms of aerial data and imagery collection ("purposes"). The use of SkyViewHD's UAs for these
purposes reduces the need to operate conventional aircraft, typically needed to perform these types
of operations, provides an economic benefit to the business consumer as the SkyViewHD UA
provides higher quality imagery at a fraction of the cost of surveys using conventional aircraft.
These savings result in not only enhanced efficiency and productivity for the affected activities
but added environmental and safety benefits to the public at large.

         For the purposes outlined above, and as more fully described below, SkyViewHD's
requested exemption would authorize commercial operations, using SkyViewHD's UAs, which
will be operated under controlled conditions at an altitude of no greater than four hundred (400)
feet AGL in airspace that is limited in scope and will have automated control features. As outlined
below, the airspace in which SkyViewHD's UAs will operate within will be disclosed to the FAA
in advance to flight operation. Finally, SkyViewHD's UAs will be used in lieu of comparatively
hazardous operations now conducted with fixed wing and rotary conventional aircraft which
should reassure the FAA that these operations will achieve at least an equivalent level or greater
level of safety. The types of aircraft SkyViewHD anticipates utilizing in order to provide the
purposes includes: DJI Inspire 1, DJI Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, DJI Phantom 3, DJI
S-1000, and BirdsEyeView FireFLY6.

                                                               2

         In the interest of economic efficiency and public safety, SkyViewHD hereby respectfully
applies for an exemption from the listed FARs to allow commercial operations of SkyViewHD's
UAs, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein or
as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333. Approval of this exemption would
thereby enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's)
responsibilities under Section 333(c) of the Reform Act to "establish requirements for the safe
operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system."

         As discussed above and more fully described below, the requested exemption would permit
the operation of small, unmanned and relatively inexpensive UAs under controlled conditions in
airspace that is limited and predetermined. Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance
safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's ("Administrator") responsibilities to
"...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace
system." See Section 333(c) of the Reform Act.

         This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing
Section 333(a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of Transportation to
consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace
system (NAS) before completion of the rulemaking required under Section 333 of the Reform Act.
In making this determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of UAs do not
create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security in light of the
following:

         · The UA's size, weight, speed, and operational capability;
         · Operation of the UAs in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
         · Operation of the UAs within visual line of sight ("VLOS") of the operator.

Reform Act § 333 (a).

         Lastly, if the Secretary determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the national
airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
in the national airspace system." Id. §333(c) (emphasis added).

         The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority by its terms includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under
§40101 of the Act, that includes UAs, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a
current airworthiness certificate.

         The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation prescribed
under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of this title if the
Administrator finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C. §44701(f). See also 49 USC
§44711(a); 49 USC §44704; 14 CFR §91.203 (a) (1).

                                                               4

         SkyViewHD's UAs are rotorcraft and fixed wing aircraft weighing less than fifty-five (55)
pounds (25 Kg) including energy source(s), equipment and any payload. They operate, under
normal conditions at a ground speed of no more than eighty-seven (87) knots (100 miles per hour)
and have the capability to hover, and move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously.
They will operate only in line of sight and will operate only within the area described in the
SkyViewHD's Flight Operations Procedure Manual ("FOPM") which has been attached as
Exhibit "1" and is incorporated herein by reference. Such operations will insure that the UA will
"not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public."1

         Given the small size of the UAs involved and the restricted sterile environment within
which they will operate, SkyViewHD falls squarely within that zone of safety (an equivalent level
of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption, allow commercial
operations of UAs to commence immediately. Also due to the size of the UAs and the restricted
areas in which the relevant UAs will operate, approval of the application presents no national
security issue. Given the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained
in the Federal Aviation Act, as amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding the
proposed operations, and the significant public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in
environmental impacts, including reduced emissions associated with allowing UAs for aerial
photography operations, the grant of the requested exemptions is in the public interest.
Additionally, there is economic efficiency created with the use of SkyViewHD's UAs as the
typical cost to perform aerial photography with helicopters and airplanes heavily multiplies the
cost to business consumers and government agencies, including law enforcement, for the services
which are to be provided by SkyViewHD.

         Accordingly, SkyViewHD respectfully requests that the FAA grant the requested
exemption without delay.

                      AIRCRAFT AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

         SkyViewHD proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have
the characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for
at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory
structure because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to the operations
conducted with conventional aircraft.

          Phone: 407-478-7958www.skyviewhd.com
         These limitations and conditions to which SkyViewHD agrees to be bound when
conducting all operations under an FAA issued exemption include:

         1. The UAs will weigh less than fifty-five (55) pounds (25 Kg).

         2. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be two (2) hours. Flights
               will be terminated at twenty-five percent (25%) battery power reserve should that
               occur prior to the two (2) hour time limit.

         3. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than four-hundred (400) feet AGL.

         4. SkyViewHD's UAs may not be operated at a speed exceeding eighty-seven (87)
               knots (100 miles per hour) and may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to
               determine compliance with the eighty-seven (87) knot (100 miles per hour) speed
               restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum
               UA operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.

         5. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the UA Pilot and a Visual Observer
               ("VO").

         6. A PIC must hold either an airline transport, commercial, private, recreational, or sport
               pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a current FAA airman medical certificate or
               a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico,
               a territory, a possession, or the Federal government. The PIC must also meet the flight
               review requirements specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is
               rated on his or her pilot certificate.

         7. The UA Pilot will be Pilot in Command (PIC).

         8. The UAs will only operate within an area as defined in the FOPM.

         9. A briefing will be conducted with regard to the planned UA operations prior to flight
               operations. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be performing duties
               with regard to the flight operations be present for this briefing.

                                                               6

         10. SkyViewHD will obtain the consent of all persons involved in the purposes outlined
               above (or similar operations).

         11. The PIC and VO will have been trained in operation of UAs generally and received
               up-to-date information on the particular UA to be operated and the UA will be
               operated in conformity with SkyViewHD's FOPM.

         12. The PIC and VO will at all times be able to communicate via voice communication.

         13. Written and/or oral permission from the relevant property holder(s), or their
               authorized representative(s), will be obtained.

         14. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from territorial, state, county
               or city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire, or other appropriate
               governmental agencies.

         15. If the UA loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA will return to the
               launch site of the UA, or another more appropriate site, and land.

         16. The UA will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unpredicted obstacles or
               emergencies.

                                    14 C.F.R. PART 21, SUBPART H:
                 AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATES 14 C.F.R. §91.203 (A) (1)

         Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for
the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1). Given the size and
limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by SkyViewHD, an exemption
from Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and
Section 333 of the Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.§44701 (f)) and Section 333
of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an
airworthiness certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed, operational capability, and
proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UA. In all cases, an analysis of these
criteria demonstrates that the UA operated without an airworthiness certificate, in the restricted
environment and under the conditions proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional

                                                               7

aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness certificate without the
restrictions and conditions proposed.

         The UAs to be operated hereunder is less than fifty-five (55) pounds (25 Kg) fully loaded,
carries neither a pilot nor passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and
operates exclusively within a secured area as set out in the FOPM. Unlike other civil aircraft,
operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by both the operator,
pursuant to the FOPM's requirements, and under the requirements and in compliance with local
public safety requirements, to provide security for the area of operation as is now done with
conventional aerial photography. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations. These
safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in connection with motion
picture and television production, provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property
owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14
C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no
credible threat to national security posed by the UAs, due to its size, speed of operation, location
of operation, lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a
substantial external load.

                      14 C.F.R. § 45.23 (B). MARKING OF THE AIRCRAFT

         The regulation requires:

                  When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the registration
                  number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or
                  experimental or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must also
                  display on that aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot
                  station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the
                  words "limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or
                  "provisional," as applicable.

         Even though the UAs will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be needed
as the UAs will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the words "limited,"
"restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," may be placed. Given the size of the
UAs, two-inch lettering will be impossible. The word "experimental," or any other term as is so
required, will be placed on the fuselage of the UAs in compliance with §45.29 (f).

         The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the UAs marked on its fuselage
as required by §45.29 (f) where the pilot, observer and others working with the UAs will see the
identification of the UAs as "Experimental." The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this
regulation to Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

                           14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (A) & (B): PRIVATE PILOT
                  PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS: PILOT IN COMMAND

  14 C.F.R. § 61.113(A) & (B); 61.133(A): PRIVATE PILOT PRIVILEGES ANDLIMITATIONS;
          PILOT IN COMMAND; COMMERCIAL PILOT PRIVILEGES AND LIMITATIONS.

         Section 61.113(a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Unlike a
conventional aircraft that carries a pilot, passengers, and cargo, the UA in this case is remotely
controlled with no passengers or property of others on board. Section 61.133(a) requires an
individual with a commercial pilot's license to be pilot in command of an aircraft for
compensation or hire. SkyViewHD respectfully proposes that operator requirements should take
into account the characteristics of the particular UA.

         The FAA has noted the following in the previously granted exemption number 11192:

                  "Regarding the petitioner's requested relief from 14 CFR § 61.113 Private
                  pilot privileges and limitations, the FAA must consider the appropriate level
                  of pilot certification for the petitioner's proposed operations. The petitioner
                  states it would operate its UAS with a pilot holding a sport pilot certificate
                  or a recreational pilot certificate and certified by the UA manufacturer and
                  has completed the FAA private pilot's written exam. Under current
                  regulations, civil operations for compensation or hire require a PIC holding
                  a commercial pilot certificate per 14 CFR part 61. As established in 14 CFR
                  § 61.113(a), with limited exception, a pilot holding a private pilot certificate
                  cannot act as a PIC of an aircraft for compensation or hire. However, in
                  Grant of Exemption No. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (Astraeus), the FAA
                  determined that a PIC with a private pilot certificate operating the Astraeus
                  UAS would not adversely affect operations in the NAS or present a hazard
                  to persons or property on the ground. Additionally, as previously
                  determined by the Secretary of Transportation, the requirement to have an
                  airman certificate ameliorates security concerns over civil UAS operations
                  conducted in accordance with Section 333."

                   14 C.F.R. §91.7(A): CIVIL AIRCRAFT AIRWORTHINESS

         The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness. Given
the size of the aircraft and the requirements contained in the FOPM for maintenance and use of
safety check lists prior to each flight.

   14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (B) (2): CIVIL AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL IN THE AIRCRAFT

         Section 91.9 (b) (2) provides:

             No person may operate a U.S. registered civil aircraft ...

             (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
             this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved airplane or
             Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
             any combination thereof.
         The UAs, given their size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight
manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no room or
capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.

         The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the FOPM at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the UAs will have immediate access to it. The FAA has issued
the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299,
9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and 10700.

                               14 C.F.R. § 91.103: PREFLIGHT ACTION

         This regulation requires each pilot in command to take certain actions before flight to
insure the safety of flight. As FAA approved rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided for the
aircraft an exemption will be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be provided as set forth
in the FOPM. The PIC will take all actions including reviewing weather, flight battery
requirements, landing and takeoff distances and aircraft performance data before initiation of
flight.

                                                              10

                             14 C.F.R. §91.109: FLIGHT INSTRUCTION

         Section 91.109 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free
balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual
controls.

         UAs and remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual
controls. Flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with
the aircraft via radio communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training
without fully functional dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in
experimental aircraft. See Exemption Nos. 5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of safety is
provided as neither a pilot nor passengers will be carried in the aircraft and by the size and speed
of the aircraft.

                         14 C.F.R. §91.119: MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDES

         Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119(d)
allows helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person
operating the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the FAA.
As this exemption is for UAs that are a helicopter and the exemption requests authority to operate
at altitudes up to four-hundred (400) feet AGL, or not more than two-hundred (200) above an
elevated platform from which aerial photography is planned, an exemption may be needed to allow
such operations. As set forth herein, except for the limited conditions stated in the FOPM, the
UAS will never operate at higher than four-hundred (400) feet AGL. It will however be operated
in a restricted area with security perimeter, where buildings and people will not be exposed to
operations without their pre-obtained consent.

         The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the UAs as
well as the location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the permission of the
property owner or local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property owner(s), or their
authorized representative(s), all affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations
as set forth in the FOPM. Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far in
excess of the less then fifty-five (55) pounds (25 Kg) limit proposed herein and the lack of
flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less than those presently presented
with conventional aircraft operating at or below five-hundred (500) feet AGL. In addition, the

                                                              11

low-altitude operations of the UAs will ensure separation between these small UAs operations and
the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.

                              14 C.F.R. §91.121 ALTIMETER SETTINGS

         This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the UA may not have a barometric altimeter, but
instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety will
be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the FOPM and Safety Check list, confirming the altitude
of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(A): FUEL REQUIREMENTS FOR FLIGHT IN VFR CONDITIONS

         Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under
VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to
fly to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ (1) During the
day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes."

         SkyViewHD believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151(a) falls within the scope of
prior exemptions. See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate
without compliance with FAR 91.151 (a)). Operating the small UAS, in a tightly controlled area
where only people and property owners or official representatives who have signed waivers will
be allowed, with less than thirty (30) minutes of reserve fuel, does not engender the type of risks
that Section 91.151(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed of the small UAs.
Additionally, limiting UA flights to ten (10) minutes would greatly reduce the utility and economic
efficiency for which the exemption will be granted.

         SkyViewHD believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights
to two (2) hours or twenty-five percent (25%) of battery power whichever happens first. This
restriction would be more than adequate to return the UAs to their planned landing zone from
anywhere in its limited operating area.

         Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689F,
5745, 10673, and 10808.

                        14 C.F.R. §91.203 (A) AND (B): CARRYING CIVIL
                      AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION AND REGISTRATION

         The regulation provides in pertinent part:

                  (a) Except as provided in § 91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft
                           unless it has within it the following:

                                    (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate. . . .

                  (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness
                           certificate required by paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight
                           authorization issued under §91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit
                           entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

         The UAs fully loaded weight is no greater than fifty-five (55) pounds (25 Kg) and is
operated without an onboard pilot. As such, there is no ability or place to carry certification and
registration documents or to display them on the UA.

         An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the UA will have immediate access to them to the extent they
are applicable to the UA. The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A
representative sample of other exceptions includes Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A,
9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

                   14 C.F.R. §91.405 (A); 407 (A) (1); 409 (A) (2); 417(A) & (B):
                                    MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS

         These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of
this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

         Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate,
these sections will not apply to SkyViewHD. Maintenance will be accomplished by the operator
pursuant to the flight manual and operating handbook as referenced in the FOPM. An equivalent

                                                              13

level of safety will be achieved because these small UAs are very limited in size and will carry a
small payload and operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues
arise the UAs may land immediately and will be operating from no higher than four-hundred (400)
feet AGL. As provided in the FOPM, the operator will ensure that the UAs are in working order
prior to initiating flight, perform required maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance
performed. Moreover, the operator is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to
maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

                                                    *********

         Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

         SkyViewHD seeks an exemption from the following rules:
         14 C.F.R. §21, subpart H; 14 C.F.R 45.23(b);14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113( a) & (b);91.7 (a); 91.9
         (b) (2);91.103(b);91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151(a);91.203(a) and (b); 91.405 (a); 91.407
         (a) (1); 91.409 (a) (2); 91.409 (a) (2) and 91.417 (a) & (b) to operate commercially a small
         unmanned vehicle weighing less than fifty-five (55) pounds (25 Kg) in its operations.

         Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of UAs for the operational
purposes outlined above, or similar operations, will enhance safety by reducing risk. Typically,
these types of operations are performed using jet or piston power aircraft. These aircraft operate
at extremely low altitudes just feet from the object being photographed and often in extreme
proximity to people and structures. They also present heightened risks associated with vehicles
that weigh in the neighborhood of four thousand (4,000) pounds, carrying large amounts of jet A
or other fuel (one hundred and forty (140) gallons for jet helicopters). Not only is there danger
created using these types of aircraft during operations, such aircraft must fly to and from the site's
location. In contrast, a UA weighing less than fifty-five (55) pounds and powered by batteries
eliminates virtually all of that risk given the reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on
board. The UA is carried to the site of the purposes outlined above (or similar operations) and not
flown to the site. The UA will carry no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to
the risks associated with manned aircraft flights.

         The operation of small UAs, weighing less than fifty-five (55) pounds, conducted in the
strict conditions outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of
the exemptions requested herein, including exempting SkyViewHD from the requirements of Part

                                                              14

21 and allowing commercial operations. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close
to the ground, and in a sterile environment and, as a result, are far safer than conventional
operations conducted with turbine helicopters operating in close proximity to the ground and
people.

                                                    PRIVACY

         All flights will occur over private, controlled or approved property with the property
owner's, or their authorized representative, prior consent and knowledge. The aerial photography
will be of structures and objects whose owner, or authorized representative, has consented to the
aerial photography. The grant of this exemption request will provide improved safety in operations.

         Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 - size, weight,
speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation within visual
line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the granting of
the requested exemptions allowing commercial operation of SkyViewHD's UAs pursuant to the
FOPM attached hereto.

          SUMMARY OF SKYVIEWHD'S REQUEST FOR AN FAA EXEMPTION

         1. Operations authorized by this a grant of exemption will be limited to the requested
                  aircraft when weighing less than fifty-five (55) pounds including payload.

         2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
                  not permitted.

         3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding eighty-seven (87) knots (100
                  miles per hour). The exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated
                  airspeed to determine compliance with the eighty-seven (87) knot speed restriction.
                  In no case will the UA be operated at airspeeds greater than the maximum UA
                  operating airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.

         4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than four-hundred (400) feet
                  above ground level (AGL) and the altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

         5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
                  This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other
                  than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical
                  certificate or U.S. driver's license.
                                                              15

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be
         used to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for
         the duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAs and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating
         documents, conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be
         followed. Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its
         operating documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents.
         It is the operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and
         revised documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon
         request. The operator must also present updated and revised documents if it
         petitions for extension or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator
         determines that any update or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA
         granted this exemption, then the operator must petition for an amendment to its
         grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be
         contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the operating
         documents.

8. Any UA that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
         operation or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component,
         must undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under
         this exemption. Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO
         and must remain at least five-hundred (500) feet from other people. The functional
         test flight must be conducted in such a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to
         persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UA to ensure that it
         is in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
         UA is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
         potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the

         inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UA, the aircraft
         is prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed
         and the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UA manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
         replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
         components.

12. Each UA operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
         bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
         commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold
         a current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by
         a state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the
         Federal government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements
         specified in 14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her
         pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
         ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
         operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
         maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures.
         PIC qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent
         with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs
         and VOs (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's
         ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
         operated under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption.
         However, training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training
         sessions. During training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons
         not essential for flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must
         operate the UA with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with
         14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UA operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
         operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
         Flights under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within five (5) nautical miles of an airport reference point
         ("ARP") as denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory ("AFD") or for
         airports not denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on
         the current FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that
                                                    17

         airport's management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a Certificate of Waiver
         and Authorization ("COA") issued to the exemption holder. The letter of agreement
         with the airport management must be made available to the Administrator or any
         law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than five-hundred (500) feet below or less than
         two-thousand (2,000) feet horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than
         three (3) statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UA loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
         pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
         weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
         intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the
         reserve power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
         number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
         (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings
         must be as large as practicable.

22. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS
         and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available
         to the PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is
         operating. These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any
         law enforcement official upon request.

23. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
         activities at all times.

24. The UA may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

25. All Flight operations must be conducted at least five-hundred (500) feet from all
         nonparticipating persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:

         a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating
                  persons from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator
                  must ensure that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If

                                                    18

                           a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and
                           are within five-hundred (500) feet of the UA, flight operations must cease
                           immediately in a manner ensuring the safety of nonparticipating persons;
                           and,

                  b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted
                           permission for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a
                           safety assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and
                           determined that it does not present an undue hazard.

                  The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
                  nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

         26. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
                  permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
                  Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
                  obtained for each flight to be conducted.

         27. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
                  boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be
                  reported to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within twenty-four (24)
                  hours. Accidents must be reported to the National Transportation Safety Board
                  ("NTSB") per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

         Unless otherwise specified in a grant of exemption, the UA, the UA's PIC, and the UA's
operations must comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45,
47, 61, and 91.

         SkyViewHD respectfully requests the FAA grant an exemption pursuant to this
application.
