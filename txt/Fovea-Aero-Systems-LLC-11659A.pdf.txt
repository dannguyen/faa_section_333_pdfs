                                                      Exemption No. 11659A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0545

Mr. Jeffrey Sassinsky
President
Fovea Aero Systems LLC
60 Fostertown Road
Medford, NJ 08055

Dear Mr. Sassinsky:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 20, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Fovea Aero Systems LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to
your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to conduct closed-set motion picture and television filming and production operations.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11659
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
                                                                                                                  2
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to permit closed-set motion picture and television filming.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations
All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11659 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 2 has been updated to reflect operations for closed-set motion
picture and television filming.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         permitted.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service
