                                                          Exemption No. 11394
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0160

Mr. Craig E. Bryan
Chief Pilot
Cirrus Exploration Company
3423 South Soncy Road, Suite 200
Amarillo, TX 79119

Dear Mr. Bryan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter posted January 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Cirrus Exploration Company (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) to conduct flight instruction, commercial aerial work flight operations, student
instruction, aerial photography and survey, and power line or pipeline patrol.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ and a DJI Inspire 1.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Cirrus Exploration Company is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Cirrus Exploration Company is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ and DJI Inspire 1 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload.
         Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to
         amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
         be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
                                                                                                            4

    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
    documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

Extent of and Reasons for Relief Soujzht
Cirrus intends to operate two commercially available UAS types (DJI Phantom 2 Vision + and DJI Inspire 1) for the
purpose of providing flight demonstration and instruction and aerial work under the provisions of 14 CFR
Section 119.1 (e)(1) Student instruction, Section 119.1 (e)(4)(iii) Aerial photography or survey, and Section 119.1
(e)(4)(vi) Powerline or pipeline patrol. Cirrus currently holds Air Carrier Certificate 3CXA478M effective May 10,
2011 operating both fixed-wing and rotorcraft (helicopter) aircraft. Cirrus intends to offer commercial "aerial
work" services utilizing UAS under the exemptions to 14 CFR Section 135 granted under 14 CFR 119.1(e) as set
forth above. Additionally, Cirrus chief pilot, Craig E Bryan, holds a Commercial Pilot Certificate No. 3226654
(Airplane Single & Multiengine Land, Instrument Airplane, Rotorcraft-Helicopter, and Glider along with Flight
Instructor Certificate No. 3226654CF1 (Airplane Single & Multiengine and Glider).

                                                                           Page 5 of 13
Public Interest and Benefit
The above "aerial work" services, normally provided in manned aircraft, may be provided with increased safety
and at significantly lower cost in situations where the use of unmanned UAS aircraft would supplement or
replace the use of manned aircraft as a result of safety or economic considerations in certain applications where
extended operational range and limited time aloft are not a factor. The proposed UAS operations will pose no
threat to the public given its small size and lack of combustible fuel when compared to larger manned aircraft,
minimize potential ecological affects or damage, and promote economic growth by providing data information
to individuals or companies requiring aerial survey or imaging data. Additionally, the growth of the UAS industry
has precipitated a large influx of "recreational" UAS pilots without formal knowledge or training regarding the
effects or potential danger of UAS flight with the National Airspace System (NAS). While it is unclear what, if
any, pilot certification requirements will ultimately apply to UAS pilots operating for commercial purposes under
the final rulemaking process, there is a present need for training and dissemination of the applicable federal
aviation regulations and flight characteristics of UAS to the general public; specifically current and potential UAS
operators. UAS flight and ground demonstration and instruction for compensation utilizing the current system
of certificated flight instructors provides economic incentive to accomplish the public goal of integration of both
recreational and commercial UAS into the NAS while promoting safety and maintenance public awareness of
current regulations affecting UAS operation.

Exemptions Provide a Level of Safety Equal to or Greater than the Existing Level under Current Regulations
The use of UAS operated under the requested exemptions as set forth above have the capacity to operate with
less risk of accident or injury and the associated loss of property or life while performing the same aerial work
services offered in manned aircraft in certain situations where extended operational range and limited time aloft
are not a factor. Likewise, UAS flight and ground demonstration and instruction for compensation promote and
encourage the existing system of certificated flight instructors to participate in the public educational process
utilizing UAS rather than manned aircraft.

Manned aircraft are at risk of fuel spillage and fire in the event of an incident or accident. The DJI Phantom 2
Vision+ and Inspire 1 carry no fuel, and therefore the risk of fire following an incident or accident due to fuel
spillage is eliminated.

This petition for exemption does not propose an electronic means to monitor and communicate with other
aircraft, such as transponders or sense and avoid technology. Rather the risk is mitigated by placing limits on
altitude, requiring stand-off distance from clouds, permitting daytime operations only, and requiring that the
UAS be operated within VLOS and yield right of way to all manned operations. Additionally, the Proposed
Conditions and Limitations provide that the Cirrus will request a notice to airmen (NOTAM) prior to operations
to alert other users of the NAS.

Cirrus' UAS has the capability -to operate safely after experiencing certain in-flight contingencies or failures and
uses an auto-pilot system to maintain UAS stability augmentation and control. The UAS is also able to respond
to a loss of GPS or a lost-link event with pre-coordinated automated flight maneuvers. These safety features
provide an equivalent or higher level of safety compared to a manned aircraft holding an airworthiness
certificate (restricted or otherwise) performing a similar operation.

                                                                            Page 6 of 14

Additional Information Offered in Support of this Petition for Exemption
Cirrus chief pilot, Craig E Bryan ("Bryan"), operated various manned aircraft, including fixed-wing and rotorcraft,
for commercial purposes including aerial work and flight instruction since 1983. Additionally, Bryan has
operated commercially available UAS vehicles for the past three years for non-commercial personal use in order
gain flight experience and familiarity with the operating characteristics and limitations of the UAS and its
videography and photography systems. As a result it is believed there are certain aerial work situations, where
the range and time aloft limitations of UAS are not a factor, whereby aerial work may be conducted with greater
safety and less risk to persons or property on the ground while offering the same or improved level of aerial
work product. Manned aircraft platforms such as airplanes and helicopters often subject the occupants as well
as persons and property on the ground to higher levels of risk for accident or injury even while being operated
pursuant to all of the applicable federal aviation regulations.

1 In the matter of Douglas Trudeau, Realtor, Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0481
2 Relief from this section is not necessary under the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of P.L. 112-95 in reference to
49 USCSection 44794 given the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the proposed UAS

                                                                           Page 7 of 13
The DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ and the DJI Inspire 1 UAS are both commercially produced and widely available aerial
videography and photography platforms utilizing advanced GPS enabled stability augmentation and control
systems including "failsafe" features allowing the operator to manually take control of the aircraft or initiate an
automated "return to home" feature in the event of adverse inflight events. The UAS also incorporates
automated "failsafe" features to initiate "return to home" or "autoland" commands in the event of loss of
control signal link or diminished battery output or capacity.

The manufacturer, DJI, provides comprehensive operational and safety manuals for both UAS and all flights will
be conducted in accordance with the requirements and guidance issued in these manuals.

Cirrus states that § 91.7(a) prohibits the operation of an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. Cirrus
asserts that since there is currently no certificate applicable to his operation, this regulation is inapplicable.

Cirrus states that § 91.9(b)(2) requires an aircraft flight manual in the aircraft, however since there are no pilots
or passengers on board his aircraft and given its size, this regulation is inapplicable. Cirrus further indicates an
equivalent level of safety will be achieved by maintaining a safety/flight manual with the UAS ground station.

Proposed Conditions and Limitations
Cirrus (also hereafter referred to as the operator) proposes the following Proposed Conditions and Cimitations in
the form of a proposed Grant of Exemption:

The following documents, including any updates or revision by the manufacturer, provided by the operator in its
petition are incorporated by reference, and are hereinafter referred to as operating documents:

            1) DJI Inspire 1 User Manual (EN) v1.0
            2) DJI Inspire 1 Safety Guidelines v1.0
            3) DJI Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines v1.0
            4) DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ User Manual (EN) v1.6
            5) DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ Pilot Training Guide (EN) v1.1
            6) DJI Smart Flight Battery Safety Guidelines(EN, FR, DE and JP)
Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be grounds for the
immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

            1) Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the following aircraft described in
                  the operating documents which are quad-rotor aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds:
                        DJI PHANTOM 2 Vision+ Unmanned Aircraft System (manufacturer published gross weight 2.74
                        pounds) ; and,
                        DJI Inspire 1 Unmanned Aircraft System (manufacturer published gross weight 6.47 pounds).
                  Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
                  grant.

                                                                            Page 8 of 13
            2) The UAS may not be flown at an indicated airspeed exceeding 43 knots. 3

            3) The UAS must be operated at an altitude of no more than 500 feet above ground level (AGL), as
                  indicated by the procedures specified in the operating documents. AII altitudes reported to ATC
                  must be in feet AGL.

           4) The UAS must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot in Command (PIC) at all
                  times. This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
                  corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate.

            5) AII operations commercial "aerial work" flight operations [as defined by 14 CFR Section 119.1 (e)(1)
                  Student instruction, Section 119.1 (e)(4)(iii) Aerial photography or survey, and Section 119.1
                  (e)(4)(vi) Powerline or pipeline patrol] must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UAS must be operated
                  within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the VO at all times. The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS
                  requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS capability. The VO and PIC must be able to
                  communicate verbally at all times. The PIC must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer
                  his or her designation for the duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform
                  the functions prescribed in the operating documents.

            6) AII flight instruction operations must be conducted such that the flight instructor has immediate
                  access to the master ground control station (either through physical proximity or electronic access
                  through a slave ground controller) for the purpose of assuming positive control of the UAS in the
                  event of loss of control by a trainee or person acting under the provisions of a student pilot
                  certificate issued by the FAA.

            7) The operating documents and this grant of exemption must be accessible during UAS operations
                  and made available to the Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the
                  conditions and limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating
                  documents, the conditions and limitations herein tal(e precedence and must be followed.
                  Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating documents. The
                  operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the operator's responsibility to track
                  such revisions and present updated and revised documents to the Administrator upon request. The
                  operator must also present updated and revised documents if he petitions for extension or
                  amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or revision
                  would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the operator must petition
                  for amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be
                  contacted if questions arise regarding updates or revisions to the operating documents.

            8) Prior to each flight, the PIC must inspect the UAS to ensure it is in a condition for safe flight. If the
                  inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the UAS is prohibited from

3 Maximum published velocity [DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ (29.16 knots), DJI Inspire 1(42.76 knots)]

                                                                            Page 9 of 13
      operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the UAS is found to be in a
      condition for safe flight. The Ground Control Station must be included in the preflight inspection. AII
      maintenance and alterations must be properly documented in the aircraft records.

9) Any UAS maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or flight characteristics, e.g.
      replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo a functional test flight. The PIC who
      conducts the functional test flight must make an entry in the aircraft records.

10) The pre-flight inspection section in the operating documents must account for all discrepancies, i.e.
      inoperable components, items, or equipment, not already covered in the relevant sections of the
      operating documents.

11) The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's aircraft/component, maintenance, overhaul,
      replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements.

12) The operator must carry out its maintenance, inspections, and record keeping requirements, in
      accordance with the operating documents. Maintenance, inspection, and alterations must be noted
      in the aircraft records, including total flight hours, description of work accomplished, and the
      signature of the authorized person returning the UAS to service.

13) Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer Safety Bulletins.

14) The authorized person must make an entry in the aircraft record of the corrective action taken
      against discrepancies discovered between inspections.

      may be included in the 10 hours of multi-rotor time prescribed above. The PIC must accomplish 3
     take-offs and landings in the preceding 90 days (for currency purposes). Training, proficiency,
      experience-building, and take-off and landing currency flights can be conducted under this grant of
      exemption to accomplish the required flight time and 90 day currency. However, said training
      operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During training, proficiency,
      and experience-building flights the PIC is required to operate the UAS with appropriate distances in
      accordance with 14 CFR 91.119.

18) The operator may not permit the PIC to operate the UAS for the purpose of flight instruction or
      aerial work as defined by 14 CFR Section 119.1 (e)(1) Student instruction, Section 119.1 (e)(4)(iii)
     Aerial photography or survey, and Section 119.1 (e)(4)(vi) Powerline or pipeline patrol, unless the
      PIC has demonstrated and logged in a manner consistent with 14 CFR 61.51(b), the ability to safely
      operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated under this exemption,
      including evasive and emergency maneuvers and maintaining appropriate distances from people,
     vessels, vehicles and structures.

19) UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR 1.1. AII operations must be
      conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

20) The UAS may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point as denoted on a
      current FAA-published aeronautical chart unless, prior to such operation, the PIC coordinates and
      obtains authorization and airspace clearance from any National Airspace System (NAS) controlling
      authority having jurisdiction over the affected airspace and establishes and maintains continuous
     verbal communication or contact with said authority (ATC) through radio or telephonic methods for
     the duration of flight.

21) The UAS may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet horizontally from a
      cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

22) If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, it must return to a pre-determined location
     within the planned operating area and land or be recovered in accordance with the operating
      documents.

23) The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies in accordance
     with the operating documents.

                                                              Page 11 of 13
24) The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast weather
     conditions) there is enough power to fly at normal cruising speed to the intended landing point and
     land the UAS with 30% battery power remaining.

25) The operator must obtain an Air Traffic Organization (ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or
     Authorization (COA) prior to conducting any operations under this grant of exemption. This COA will
     also require the operator to request a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) not more than 72 hours in
     advance, but not less than 48 hours prior to the operation.

26) AII aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial number,
     registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings in
     accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be as large as practicable.

27) Before conducting operations, the radio frequency spectrum used for operation and control of the
     UAS must comply with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or other appropriate
     government oversight agency requirements.

28) The documents required under 14 CFR 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the PIC at the Ground
     Control Station of the UAS any time the UAS is operating. These documents must be made available
     to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

29) The UAS must remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned aviation operations and
     activities at all times

30) The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

31) The UAS may not be operated over congested or densely populated areas.

32) Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating persons, vessels,
     vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons from the
     UAS and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure that nonparticipating
     persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises where nonparticipating persons leave
     such protection and are within 500 feet of the UAS, flight operations must cease immediately
     and/or;
           b. The aircraft is operated near vessels, vehicles or structures where the owner/controller of
     such vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission and the PIC has made a safety
     assessment of the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not present
     an undue hazard, and;
           c. Operations nearer to the PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons do not present an
     undue hazard to those persons per § 91.119(a).

           33) AII operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with permission from
                 the land owner/controller or authorized representative. Permission from land owner/controller or
                 authorized representative will be obtained for each flight to be conducted.

           34) Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical boundaries of the
                 operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported to the FAA's UAS Integration
                 Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be reported to the Nationa) Transportation Safety
                 Board (NTSB) per instructions contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov .

Unless otherwise specified in this grant of exemption, the UAS, the UAS PIC, and the UAS operations must
comply with all applicable parts of 14 CFR including, but not limited to, parts 45, 47, 61, and 91.
