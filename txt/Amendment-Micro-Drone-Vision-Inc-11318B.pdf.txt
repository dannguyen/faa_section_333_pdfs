                                                      Exemption No. 11318B
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-1057

Ms. Bonnie L. Edwards
Vice President and Director of Operations
Micro Drone Vision, Inc.
15000 Citrus Country Drive, Suite 103
Dade City, FL 33523

Dear Ms. Edwards:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 27, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Micro Drone Vision, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to
your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection1 and closed-set
motion picture and television filming. You requested an amendment to add the DJI Phantom
3, Yuneec Typhoon Q500, Yuneec Typhoon Q500 +, and Yuneec Typhoon Q500 + Pro2.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
2 The petitioner also requested authority to conduct UAS training. At this time, the FAA is unable to authorize
UAS operations for training until a further assessment is completed. When the FAA completes its review, we
will proceed accordingly and no further action will be required by the petitioner. However, the petitioner is
permitted to train its own pilot in commands and visual observers in accordance with condition no. 14 and the
other conditions and limitations in this exemption.
                                                                                                                  2

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11318A
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11318A remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 1,
         DJI Phantom 2, 550S Flame Wheels, Inspire 1, S1000, 3D Robotics Iris+, Apprentice,
         and Penguin B, DJI Phantom 3, Yuneec Typhoon Q500, Yuneec Typhoon Q500 +,
         and Yuneec Typhoon Q500 + Pro when weighing less than 55 pounds including
         payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a
         petition to amend this exemption.
                                                                                     3

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to thank you again for the approval of our 333 Exemption No. 11318 for
Micro Drone Vision, Inc.

At this time we would like to amend our 333 Exemption to include the latest:
    1. DJI Phantom 3
    2. YUNEEC's: Typhoon Q 500, 500+, and 500+Pro
    3. While adding "inspection flights" to types of operations.

These requests will have no change to MDV's Operations, Manual, Training Program, or
maintenance program. This additional Phantom model adds the third in a series of DJI
Phantom's already approved.

This addition to Exemption No. 11318 would permit commercial operation by MDV,
using the DJI Phantom 3 and the YUNEEC Typhoon Q 500, 500+, and 500+Pro to conduct
"sUAS flight training, agriculture, education, real estate photography, and videography,
film and movie production, demonstrations, and inspection flights ".

I again would like to thank you for the help you have given in approving MDV's request
and if you need any additional information please feel free to contact me at 321-505-
2920.

Sincerely,

Bonnie L. Edwards
Owner and Secretary
