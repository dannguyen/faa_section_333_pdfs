                                                           Exemption No. 13051
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2789

Mr. Paul Kolfenbach
31926 Rosales Ave
Murrieta, CA 92563

Dear Mr. Kolfenbach:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter posted to the public docket on July 13, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) for an exemption. You requested to operate an unmanned aircraft
system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography, cinematography, videography, mapping, crop
surveying, and inspections.

See the docket, at www.regulations.gov, for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the
proposed operations and the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
                                                                                           2

Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Mr. Paul Kolfenbach is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Mr. Paul Kolfenbach is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the enclosed COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;
           c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
              the UAS;
           d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
           e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
           f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners

Dear Sir or Madam,

In accordance with the FAA's Guidelines for Submitting a Petition for Exemption under
Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of2012, I Paul Kolfenbach, referred to
hereafter
as the petitioner, request exemption from the following sections ofTitle 14, Code of Federal
Regulations §§
61.113(a); 61.113(b); 91.119(c); 91.121; 91.151(a); 91.405(a); 91.407(a); 91.409(a);
91.409(a)(2);
91.417(a) & (b);

In order to operate small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) commercially in airspace regulated
by the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) for the purposes of aerial photography, cinematography,
Videography, mapping, crop surveying, inspections and other flight operations that could be
Performed safely and more cost effectively with the use of small UAS at low altitude within the
U.S. national airspace system as compared to a manned aircraft. Operations will be performed
only at the request of and with the authorization and permission of clients or their authorized
agents in order to facilitate commerce and raise awareness of the beneficial uses of small
unmanned air systems. So long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions ·
 outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333. The conditions
identified and proposed by the petitioner are drawn from references 1-3.

TheFARS

The petitioner seeks exemption from the above mentioned FARs for the following reasons;
61.113(a) & 9b); The petitioner requests relief in order to facilitate the utilization
of pilots who hold a Private Pilots (or greater) certificate. Any pilots operating under this
exemption would be required to comply with any conditions as set forth and in a similar fashion
to the previously granted exemptions.

91.119(c) As discussed in Exemption 11138 (DOUGLAS TRUDEAU), operations
conducted closer than 500 feet to the ground may require that the UA be operated closer than
500 feet to essential persons, or objects that would not be possible without additional relief. The
petitioner requests modification, waiver or exemption and clarification concerning the terms
"congested areas" and "densely populated". The petitioner requests waiver for this condition to
allow reasonable operations in areas of subdivisions and neighborhoods if required.

91.121 As discussed in Exemption 1138 (DOUGLAS TRUDEAU) is inapplicable since the UAS
does not have an altimeter but instead utilizes electronic GPS with barometric sensors for altitude
information.

91.151(a) As discussed in Exemption 11136 (ADVANCED AVIATION SOLUTIONS LLC)
prior relief has been granted for manned aircraft to operate at less than the prescribed minimums,
including Exemption Nos, 2689, 5745, and 10650. In addition, similar UAS-specific relief has
been granted in Exemption Nos, 8811, 10808, and 10673 for day time VFR conditions. The
UAS provides battery power reaming in percent to the PIC. The UA batteries provide
approximately 25 minutes of powered flight. Information provided in the operating documents
discuss procedures regarding remaining battery power management. Those documents contain a
condition in which the PIC will initiate a landing procedure when battery remaining reaches a
specified level. Given the limitations on proposed operations and the location of those proposed
operations, the FAA found that a reduced minimum reserve for flight in day time VFR
conditions was reasonable.

91.405(a); 91.407(a)(l); 91.409(a)(l) & (2); 91.417(a) & (b) As discussed in Exemption 1138

(DOUGLAS TRUDEAU). The petitioner proposes to inspect and ensure that the UAS is in a
condition for safe flight in accordance with the operating documents. The FAA found that
adherence to the petitioner's operating documents and the conditions and limitations specified,
describing the requirements for maintenance, inspection and recordkeeping, were sufficient to
ensure that safety would not be adversely affected.

The UAS

The DJI Phantom 2 vision+ advanced is a highly successful consumer grade small rotorcraft in
the quadcopter configuration with an advertised weight of less than 44 ounces (1242g) designed
primarily to carry aloft a high definition camera. It has an advertised maximum speed of less
than 30 knots (15m/s) and a maximum climb rate ofless than 1200 feet per minute (6m/s). It is
powered by four electric motors with a distance between motors ofless than 14 inches ((350m).
exemption(s), should need arise. Operations within class B airspace are requested due to the lack
of mode C transponder.

Public interest

Use of the UAS in lieu of a manned aircraft would enhance safety and reduce the environmental
impact as compared to similar operations conducted with manned aircraft of greater proportions,
carrying a crew and flammable fuel. Additionally, use of the UAS in order to facilitate
commerce could lead to economic growth. Operations for this petition will enable service for
property owners or their designees seeking an enhanced perspective for characteristics, amenities
and benefits of their desired photographic subjects that cannot be displayed through ground level
videography/photography. Aerial photography is a valuable marketing tool that can lead to
increased commerce and enhance personal photography. Crop surveying applications could lead
to decreased use of pesticides and fertilizer and conservation of water as well as increased crop
yields and decreased costs. Aerial surveying and inspections can increase work site efficiency,
improve volumetric estimations and reduce risk. The petitioner will provide clients with
photographic data for these purposes on a "for hire" basis acting as an independent contractor. A
visual observer will be utilized. Liability insurance will be obtained commensurate with the
granting of this request for exemption. Flight data including UA flight time, Control Unit
operation time, incident, accident and details concerning any deviations from normal operations
will be available to FAA for use in collecting data regarding the use of the UAS as part of this
application. This data may be submitted to FAA via traditional means (COA monthly reports),
or other means as the Administrator may require.

Conclusion

The petitioner is requesting this exemption for the purposes of"aerial photography,
cinematography, videography, mapping, crop surveying, inspections and other flight operations.
The reason for such a general and broad based request is that the petitioner wishes to utilize a
business strategy of horizontal integration and maximize economies of scope in order to
capitalize on opportunities as they may arise in the future, without the long turnaround time
associated with additional exemptions. The petitioner's business model is based on the idea of
offering ad hoc small UAS services to individuals or companies, who wish to employ these
services as a safe, effective and legal option to enhance their business or hobby. The petitioner's
own market research shows pent up demand for these services currently exist, in the real estate
market and other markets are just beginning to emerge. Although videography and photography
are included in the request, the primary objective will be aerial survey of farm crops for precision
agriculture. The petitioner has identified university's and other agencies that could benefit from
the operation requested in this application.

A quick internet search will show that many are currently operating similar UAS in exactly the
same fashion without, it is assumed FAA authorization. The petitioner has refrained from

We designed Solo to be the perfect aerial-video too!. It's powerful, simple and reliable with intuitive Smart Shots
inspired by our favorite cinema pilots. With Solo, you don't need a professional camera crew, you can get the
perfect shot every time. We're excited to share our passion with you and help you see your world from a new
perspective. Join us in capturing the next evolution of creative videography.

1.1 System Overview                                                                                                      /

The Solo system includes Solo, the controller, the "3DR Solo" app, and you. As the operator, you interact with the
controller and app on the ground, and the controller communicates with Solo during flight.

1.1.1 Solo

Solo is a small unmanned aerial vehicle powered by four motors and four propellers. Solo's onboard computers
control navigation, attitude, and communications in flight while sending real-time telemetry and video output and
receiving control inputs over the 3DR Link secure Wi-Fi network. Solo is optimized for capturing aerial video using a
GoPro® HERO camera.

1.1.2 Controller

The controller provides control mechanisms and displays in-flight data on a full-color screen. Using twin long-
range antennas, the controller acts as the central hub for all communication on the 3DR Link network, receiving all
communications from Solo and the app, forwarding telemetry outputs to the app, and managing the transmission of
all control inputs to Solo.

1.1.3 App

The "3DR Solo" app outputs a live video stream from an onboard GoPro® camera to an Android or iOS device. The
app allows you to view the live video with overlaid telemetry and access a simplified graphic interface for controlling
Solo's advanced functions. The app also connects to the 3DR Link network to receive video and telemetry outputs
and send control inputs.

1.4 Operating Parameters

The following operating parameters apply to Solo. Always operate Solo within these parameters. Solo's pertormance
and behaviors are not guaranteed when conditions violate the parameters listed below.

                                                                 Figure 1.4.10.1: Solo Operating Parameters

*Flight time varies with payload, wind conditions, elevation, temperature, humidity, flying style,
and pilot skill. Listed flight time applies to elevations less than 2,000 ft above sea level.
**See Section 7.7 to adjust maximum altitude.
***Depending on environmental conditions
****This top speed corresponds to Solo when operating in Fly mode. Maximum speeds for advanced
modes may vary, see Section 7.1 for more information.

                                                                                                                                                                   4
1.5 Autopilot

Solo uses a Pixhawk 2 autopilot running ArduPilot Copter software. ArduPilot is open-source flight control based on
the MAVIink communication protocol. Pixhawk 2 runs an ARM Cortex-M4 STM32F427 processor with 2MB of flash
memory and 256 KB of RAM. Combined with an array of CAN, 12C, SPI, PWM, and UART interfaces, Pixhawk 2
uses a suite of onboard sensors to calculate Solo's orientation and motion in flight. This data is input into ArduPilot's
inertial navigation and position estimation algorithms and combined with control inputs to send commands to Solo's
propulsion system.

1.6 Propulsion

Solo uses four brushless 880 K, motors and four self-tightening propellers for propulsion. For control and
aerodynamic efficiency, two motors spin clockwise and two motors spin counterclockwise. Navigation in the air is
achieved by mixing propulsion of the four motors to actuate flight control along the roll, pitch, and yaw axes.

Each of the four motors is numbered by the marking on the arm. These numbers correspond to the autopilot
calculations for these commands and are used for indicating motor replacement procedures. Each motor is
controlled by an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) that regulates the rotation of the motors to achieve the speed
commanded by the autopilot.

The following best practices will help ensure safe, successful flights and help reduce the risk of accident and serious
injury. Always fly under adult supervision and with your full attention at all times. Do not fly under the influence of
drugs or alcohol or when your ability to operate Solo safely is impaired. Use your common sense to avoid unsafe
situations and always operate Solo responsibly.

                    A.. ·.· Read and und~rstaf'ld't~~se important safetY instructions before your
                  - first flight to harp red !.Ice the risk of acCident and serious injury.

3.1 Location

Don't fly Solo indoors. Always fly outside in clear, open areas at a safe distance from yourself, other people, power
lines, animals, vehicles, trees, and buildings. When flying in areas with potential hazards, maintain i 00 feet (30 m)
from any people, vehicles, or structures. As the operator, you are responsible for navigating Solo to avoid obstacles,
including during Smart Shots.

Don't fly within 5 miles of an airport or within any airspace restricted by your local, state, or national airspace
authority. As the operator, you are responsible for knowing and understanding the regulations that govern small
unmanned aircraft like Solo in your jurisdiction.

3.2 Environmental Awareness

Don't fly Solo in extreme weather conditions such as rain, high winds, snow, or fog. Extreme weather conditions can
permanently damage Solo or cause instability in flight.

Before flying, determine the boundaries of the safe flying area at your location. Be aware of any risks, including
bodies of water, structures, trees, power lines, etc, and designate a few areas where you can land Solo in case of
an unsafe situation. Throughout your flight, be prepared to recover Solo manually or use an emergency procedure if
Solo flies outside the safe flying area.

3.3 Visual Line of Sight

Always fly Solo within your visual line of sight. Don't let Solo get so far away from you that you cannot see its
orientation or so that any physical obstructions block your view of Solo.

3.4 Flight School

If you're new to flying, review the video tutorials in the Flight School area of the app before your first flight. Flight
School provides useful tips for learning to operate Solo safely and correctly.

                            Figure 3.4.5.1: App Flight School                                                              15

         Solo is pewf?rect  ·

To avoid hazardous contact with Solo's high-speed propellers, always power off Solo before handling Solo or
the propellers. When prompted to start motors before takeoff, always ensure that the propellers are clear of any
obstructions and at least 20 feet away from any people, animals, or property before activating. Do not touch moving
propellers or approach Solo while the propellers are spinning.

After landing or returning home, Solo will automatically detect the landing and stop the motors. Do not approach
Solo until the propellers stop spinning, and always power off Solo before picking it up.

3.6 GPS

Solo requires an active GPS signal for flight. After powering on, Solo can take up to 5 minutes to acquire a strong
GPS lock. Always choose a flying location with a clear view of the sky to improve GPS signal strength. The following
requirements define a GPS lock:

· Reported horizontal position accuracy                             <16ft. (5 m)
· Reported speed accuracy                                           < 2 mph (1 m/s)
· Number of satellites                                              26
· Difference between GPS and inertial navigation vertical velocity  < 2 mph (1 m/s)

3.7 Home Position

Solo's home position is the latitude and longitude coordinates of the launch point used by the autopilot as the
end point of a return-home command. The autopilot saves the home position at the location where the motors are
started only after achieving GPS lock. The location of the home position depends on GPS signal strength and is
usually within I to 2 meters of accuracy. Always take off from an open location with a clear path for Solo to return
home safely. For home position safety in advanced mode, see Section 7.4.

3.8 Altitude Limit

Always fly at appropriate altitudes for your flying location and local regulations. Solo cannot avoid obstacles on its
own, so always select altitudes that avoid any obstacles, such as trees, buildings, and power lines.

Solo includes a safety fence enabled by default at 150ft. (46 m). If Solo reaches the altitude limit, Solo will stop
ascending and limit throttle input to stay below the altitude limit. FAA regulations mandate a maximum altitude of
400 ft. to avoid potential conflicts with manned aircraft and represents a safe line-of-sight altitude.

                                                                                                                          16

If you experience a problem in flight, use one of the following emergency procedures to stop Solo, end your flight, or      J
shut off the motors.

3.9.1 Pause

The controller's Pause button allows you to stop Solo mid-air. Solo will hover at the paused location until given
another command. Use the Pause button to stop Solo from hitting an obstacle or to re-orient Solo for navigation.
Press Pause during Return Home or Land to pause Solo and stop the landing. Pause is available only with GPS
lock.

3.9.2 Regain Manual Control

Keep the controller easily accessible at all times during flight, including during Smart Shots, and be prepared to
regain manual control at any time. To return to standard flight during Smart Shots, Return Home, or Land, press the
Fly button.

3.9.3 Return Home

If Solo acquired GPS lock prior to takeoff, press the controller's Home button to return Solo to the launch point
and land. Use return home after receiving a low battery notification or to end your flight easily. Solo will not avoid
obstacles while returning home; always verify that the return path is clear before activating Return Home.

3.9.4 land

To land Solo at its current position, press and hold the Fly button. If Solo does not have GPS lock, there will be no
automatic positioning as Solo descends, and drifting may occur depending on environmental conditions.

3.9.5 Motor Shutoff

In the event that Solo's motors do not stop after landing or for an emergency in-flight kill switch, Solo includes
an emergency motor shutoff procedure. To shut off the motors at any time, either in flight or on the ground, hold
the A, B, and Pause buttons at the same time. An initial screen will appear on the controller to confirm the shutoff
command; continue to hold A, B, and Pause buttons to activate motor shutoff. Use the emergency motor shutoff
only as a last resort.

3.10 Flight Battery

Use caution when handling the Solo Smart Battery; lithium polymer batteries can cause a fire if handled incorrectly.
Never alter, puncture, throw, bend, or impact the battery. Keep the battery away from liquids, fire, microwaves, and
other hazardous or combustible materials. Don't expose the battery to extreme temperatures. If the battery is hot to
the touch, wait for it to cool before using or charging.

Inspect the battery before and after each flight. It is possible for the battery to be damaged in shipping, use or
charging. If you notice any abnormal features such as damage to the exterior shell, swelling, deformation of the
battery, abnormal smell, leakage, or other unexpected behavior, do not use the battery! These can be signs of
serious damage that can cause the battery to catch fire. To prevent a hazard in case of fire or explosion, disconnect
the battery, and place the battery in a safe area outside of any buildings or vehicles and away from flammable
materials. Do not dispose of the battery in the trash; dispose of the battery at local battery recycling center as soon
as possible. In the US and Canada, visit call2recycle.org to find a location.

For long term storage, store the battery in an 64° F to 82° F environment, between 45-85% relative humidity
and with 50% charge. Always make sure to store the battery in a place where it won't be exposed to extreme
temperatures or direct sunlight.

3.11 Controller

The controller's rechargeable lithium ion (Li-ion) battery is housed inside the controller, accessible by the battery
door on the back of the controller. The controller battery is pre-attached to the controller, and shouldn't be
disconnected unless:

      · You plan to store the controller for over three months without using it. In this case, disconnect the battery
      from the controller and leave the battery inside the controller to store it.
      · You need to replace or upgrade the controller battery. Upgraded controller batteries with double the
      capacity are available from store.3dr.com or an authorized retailer. In the case where you need to store the
      extra controller battery, store it in location where it will not come into contact with metal objects or other
      batteries. If the battery's connector comes into contact with a metal object, it can short circuit the battery and
      cause a fire.

Keep the controller away from liquids, fire, microwaves, and other hazardous or combustible materials. Don't
expose the controller to extreme temperatures. If the controller is hot to the touch, wait for it to cool before using
or charging. Perform periodic visual inspections of the controller battery to check for any damage, and handle the
controller battery using the same safety precautions as the flight battery.

3.12 Antenna Configuration

For the strongest connection to Solo, position the antennas down and away from the controller so they are
approximately perpendicular with Solo in flight, and tilt each antenna out and away from one another at a 20° angle.

                                                                                ···~

Solo's Smart Shots automate video capturing to make it easy to get stunning aerial video. Cable Cam and Orbit are
automatically assigned to the controller's A and B buttons. Use the app to access Selfie or Follow. Smart Shots are
available only with the Solo app.

When using Smart Shots without a Solo Gimbal, Solo cannot ensure that the subject is in the frame at all times.
When attempting Smart Shots without a Solo Gimbal, adjust the camera mount so the camera is fixed at an
appropriate angle to improve the chances of keeping the subject in the frame.

5.1 Selfie

In Selfie, Solo flies a smooth up-and-back path to capture a subject in a cinematic establishing shot. Before starting
a selfie, always ensure that there is a clear path 200 feet (61 m) behind and above Solo. Once Selfie is activated,
Solo will fly up and away from the subject to a point 164 feet (50 m) from the subject at 82 feet (25 m) altitude.

                                                                    Figure 5.1 .2.-1: Selfie Path and Settings

5.4 Follow

Follow creates a virtual tether between Solo and your mobile device, allowing Solo to track you as you move. If
the Follow subject is engaged in an activity that prevents them from using the controller, you are required to use a
safety pilot during Follow. The subject will carry the mobile device and be followed by Solo, and the safety pilot will
hold the controller and be ready to regain manual control at any time.

Don't allow more than 500 feet of distance between the controller and the mobile device; however, specific range
limits depend on the device being used. If too much distance is a!!owed between the contro!!er and the mobile
device, the device could lose connection with the controller.

                          Always ensure that there is a clear path tor Solo during Follow. tt

If Solo reaches the altitude limit during flight, it will maintain and not exceed that altitude and the controller will
display the following alert.

                                                           Figure 6.2. i. i: Controller -Altitude Limit Alert

6.2.2 App Connection
The controller will display the following banner-style alerts in the event that the Solo app is connected to or
disconnected from Solo. We recommend having an active connection to the Solo app at all times during flight. Refer
to Section 2.6 for connecting to Solo Wi-Fi with the app. Solo will not return home if the connection to the app in
lost during flight.

                                                                                                                                                                                           33

6.2.3 Controller Signal Alerts

Flying behind solid objects, like buildings and trees, blocks communication signals between Solo and the controller.
Always maintain visual contact with Solo to ensure that the signal is unobstructed. Cell phone towers and nearby
Wi-Fi signals can cause interference with the communication system and decrease its range. Avoid flying in
populated areas to avoid sources of interference.

If the controller becomes unpaired from Solo during flight, the controller will display the following alert and Solo will
Return Home. See Section 9.3 for pairing instructions.

                                                                       Figure 6.2.3.1: Controller- Controller Disconnected Alert

\
             If the signal between Solo and the controller is lost during flight, the controller will display the controller signal lost
             alert and Solo will Return Home. If signal is recovered while returning home, the controller will display the signal
             recovered alert and provide the option to regain manual control by pressing the Fly button.

                                                            Figure 6.2.3.2: Controllet·- Controller Signal Alerts

6.2.4 GPS Signal Alerts

If GPS is lost during flight, Solo will switch into Fly: Manual. In the event of a loss of GPS, we recommend landing
Solo and waiting to acquire GPS lock before taking off again.

In Fly: Manual, Solo uses the same joystick controls as in standard flight (displayed as "Fly"), but it does not include
any GPS positioning. Therefore, in Fly: Manual, Solo will not hold its position when the right stick is released, and
you must maintain close control over roll, pitch, and yaw. Without GPS, Pause, Return Home, and Smart Shots are
not available. During Land, Solo will not be able to maintain position due to the lack of GPS positioning and will drift
according to wind and other environmental conditions. If another alert occurs while Solo is in Fly: Manual, Solo will
not be able to Return Home and will instead initiate a non-positioned landing at the current location.

If GPS is recovered in flight, Solo will switch from Fly: Manual to standard flight (Fly), and GPS positioning will
activate. The following displays show (from left to right) the GPS lost alert, Solo in Fly:Manual, and GPS recovered
alert. Always choose a location with a clear view of the sky to improve GPS signal strength.

                                                                                                                                          34

6.2.5 Flight Battery Alerts
The controller monitors the Solo battery during flight and provides alerts when the battery reaches critical levels. At
25% and 1O% power remaining, the controller will provide a land-soon alert recommending that you end your flight
to prevent an automatic landing.

                                                               Figure 6.2.5.1: Controller - Low Battety Alerts

If the battery reaches 5%, Solo will Return Home to prevent a crash. After landing, turn off Solo immediately; if the
battery level reaches 0% at any time, irreversible damage will occur and the battery should be recycled.

                                                              Figure 6.2.5.2: Controller- Critical Battety Alert

6.2.6 Controller Battery Alerts

When the controller battery reaches 10% of its remaining charge, the controller will display an alert to notify you to
charge the controller at your next opportunity. At 5%, the controller will prompt you to end your flight and charge
the controller. If the controller battery reaches a critical level in flight, Solo will Return Home. The following displays
show (left to right) the 10%, 5%, and 0% alerts

             This section provides instructions for accessing and using Solo's advanced features and settings.

      7.1 Advanced Flight Modes

             Are you a quadcopter pro? We designed Solo to be simple and reliable, but also really fun to fly. Solo includes five
             advanced flight modes: FLY:Manual, stabilize, aero, sport, and drift.

                                         Advandect flight mod~~ are for experienced operators only. Do not
                                       attempt to ft¥'1!1 any advanced modes unless you are comfortable

                                                 flying multl&opters without positioning and altitude assistance.

             7.1.1 Fly:Manual

             Fly: Manual mode is a version of standard flight without GPS lock. In Fly:Manual, the throttle stick controls altitude
             the same way as standard flight (Fly mode). However, Fly: Manual includes no GPS positioning so that, when
             you release the right stick, Solo will not hold its position; it will drift according to wind conditions and existing
             momentum. When flying in Fly: Manual, make constant adjustment to the right stick to control Solo's position and
             use the left stick to maintain Solo's orientation.

             7.1.2 Stabilize

             Stabilize mode provides full manual control without autopilot assistance. In stabilize, the autopilot regulates Solo's
             roll and pitch angles so that Solo returns to level when you release the right stick. The throttle stick controls power
             and acceleration directly; it does not correspond to altitude. Stabilize requires fine-tuned control of both the left and
             right sticks to fly Solo. Stabilize does not require GPS lock.

             7.1.3 Drift

             Drift modes requires GPS lock and provides a plane-like flying experience. Drift is ideal for navigating Solo using
             the video feed. This is known as first-person view (FPV) and provides an immersive flying experience. In drift, Solo
             combines roll, pitch, and yaw onto the controller's right stick. To navigate Solo in drift, move the right stick to initiate
             a coordinated turn in that direction. Releasing the right stick will cause Solo to drift to a stop over a two-second
             period. Solo does not automatically control altitude in drift, and will require constant adjustments to the throttle stick
             when flying in drift.

             7.1.4 Aero

             Aero is the most advanced of Solo's flight modes. It provides unrestricted control over Solo's roll and pitch angles.
             Aero is intended for performing aerial acrobatics, flips, and maneuvers requiring extreme angles. There is no altitude
             or position assistance in aero, so be prepared to make constant adjustment to both sticks. Aero is a copter-frame
             oriented mode, meaning that, in aero, Solo will always respond to controls relative to its own orientation. Aero does
             not require GPS lock.

                                        Do not fly in aero unless you are an extremely experienced operator.

                                              Without the proper skills; 'Cr<iishes in aero are highly likely, '

7.1.5 Sport

Sport mode in a modified version of aero that includes altitude assistance and earth-frame orientation. With
altitude assistance, the throttle stick behaves the same in sport as it does in standard flight (Fly mode). Earth-frame
orientation differs from copter-frame orientation in that the direction of yaw rotation is in relation to the earth instead
of in relation to the copter itself. For example, if Solo is pitched forward in sport mode and left yaw is applied,
Solo will maintain the same pitch angle and rotate around the vertical axis. As opposed to in aero's copter-frame
orientation, in which, in the same situation, Solo will perform a cartwheel. Sport does not require GPS lock.

7.2 Enabling Advanced Flight Modes

To unlock Solo's advanced flight modes, use the app to select Advanced Settings from the Settings menu. Toggle
the Enable Advanced Flight Modes option to gain access to Solo's advanced modes.

                                                                  Figure 7.2.5. ·1: App- Advanced Settings                                                                                  )

7.3 Accessing Advanced Flight Modes

Once enabled, advanced flight modes can be accessed only be assigning them to the controller's A and B buttons
using the app. In the app, select Preset A or Preset B from the Solo menu. (The app must be connected to Solo to
apply button assignments.) Once assigned, use the controller to activate advanced modes during flight.

                                                                                                                           Oti!t

                                                              Figure 7 .3.5.1: App - A and B Presets

7.4 Home Position Safety

Fly:Manual, stabilize, aero, and sport modes do not require GPS lock. To take off without GPS lock, Solo must be
set to one of these modes. Without an active GPS signal, Return Home, Pause, and Smart Shots will be disabled.
If you choose to take off without GPS lock, Solo will not save a home position at the launch point. If Solo acquires
GPS lock mid-flight, the autopilot will save a home position at that location. To prevent a potentially unsafe situation,
do not use Return Home if Solo did not acquire GPS prior to takeoff.

                                   If Solo did not acquire GPS lock prior to takeoff, do not use Return
                                   Hom17.

                                                                                                                                                                                        37

This section covers basic operational maintenance procedures for Solo. For repairs not covered in this manual,
contact 3DR Support or an authorized Solo Service Center.

Solo's exterior components are designed to absorb impact from hard landings and protect the core electronics.
If damage is sustained to Solo's legs or motors, replace them with official 3DR parts from store.3dr.com or an
authorized retailer. 3DR offers an extended controller battery upgrade with double the capacity so you can fly more
between charges. Before opening the battery bay or performing any maintenance on Solo, always ensure that Solo
is powered off with the battery removed.

9.1 Controller Battery Replacement

To replace the controller battery, open the battery door on the back of the controller. Remove the foam block and
disconnect the battery from the port in the side of the battery compartment. To install a battery, connect the battery
to the controller, and, for standard-size controller batteries, use the foam block to pad the empty space in the
compartment. See Section 3.11 for information on safely storing spare controller batteries.

                                                                                                                        39
9.2 Calibrations

Use the Solo app to perform compass and level calibrations when prompted by the controller. Remove Solo's
propellers before performing calibrations.

9.2.1 Compass Calibration

To calibrate Solo's compass, connect the app to Solo Wi-Fi and select Compass Calibration from the Solo menu.
Ensure that Solo and the controller are powered on with the propellers removed. Solo requires an interference-free
environment for compass calibration, so ensure that you are away from metal buildings, reinforced concrete, or
other metal structures before starting calibration.

                                                        Figure 9.2. i. i: App - Compass Calibration Setup
