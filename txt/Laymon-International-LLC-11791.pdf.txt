                                                           Exemption No. 11791
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1013

Mr. Thomas A. Laymon
CEO
Laymon International LLC
21143 Hawthorne Boulevard #418
Torrance, CA 90503

Dear Mr. Laymon:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 6, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Laymon International LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial data
collection, photogrammetry of mining operations and real properties, and video
documentation of exploratory expeditions.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received two comments in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.
                                                                                                                 2

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Laymon International LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Laymon International LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1
         Model T600 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
                                                                                                            4

    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
                                                                                                            5

    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
                                                                                       6

exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial

    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must

    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical

    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
                                                                                               7

reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
    as documented in this grant of exemption.

30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
    exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
    District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
    notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
    must include at least the following:
      a. Dates and times for all flights;
      b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
          under this grant of exemption;
      c. Name and phone number of the person responsible for the on-scene operation of
          the UAS;
      d. Make, model, and serial or N-Number of UAS to be used;
      e. Name and certificate number of UAS PICs involved in the aerial filming;
      f. A statement that the operator has obtained permission from property owners
          and/or local officials to conduct the filming production event; the list of those
          who gave permission must be made available to the inspector upon request;
      g. Signature of exemption holder or representative; and
      h. A description of the flight activity, including maps or diagrams of any area, city,
          town, county, and/or state over which filming will be conducted and the altitudes
          essential to accomplish the operation.

31. Flight operations may be conducted closer than 500 feet from participating persons

    consenting to be involved and necessary for the filming production, as specified in the
    exemption holder's MPTOM.

2.2.2 Flight Conditions

         The sUAS will at all times fly within 1500 feet lateral to the PIC. Altitude will be no higher
         than 400 feet AGL. Flight ground speeds shall not exceed 43 knots. All flights will be
         within class G airspace and beyond 5 nautical miles of any airport. All flights will be day
         time only, in the visual-line-of-sight and operated only during days of clear visibility and
         low wind conditions.

         Data Collection and photogrammetric flights of mining claims and real properties will be
         done in very remote areas of Federal Bureau of Land Management lands in addition to
         privately held property. Photo and video data will also be taken of potential mineral
         prospect locations deemed too dangerous for full sized aircraft, to determine the value of
         a more detailed exploration.

         All flights will occur in potential mining and real property locations in the western states of
         California,Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and Colorado.

2.2.3 Flight Operations

         All locations will be strictly controlled for access by only the PIC, observer and
         other relevant safety personnel. The PIC will have 100+ hours of logged sUAS
         experience and the observer/spotter will be an equally qualified sUAS pilot.
         Airspace assessment must be completed both prior to preflight and again just prior
         to take off. Flight planning for each flight includes obtaining any regulatory
         permission, land-use permissions, preforming a risk assessment, and map study of
         planned flight area. Observer and support ground crew members will secure
         planned and alternate operating zones, establishing communications, and
         identifying emergency contingencies.


                    The standard pre-flight check list and procedures are as follows:

         1) The flight battery and transmitter battery must be fully charged.

         2) Always turn on the transmitter first and then the Quadcopter Multi-Rotor.

         3) Check for visible damage such as loose screws, broken, unbalanced or
                   damaged propellers, faulty connectors or solder joints, landing gear, etc.

         4) The propellers must be in a good condition and securely mounted.

         5) The rotors must spin smoothly. Must ensure that there are no objects are in the
                   rotational plane of the propellers or within a distance that poses a risk of
                   obstruction.

         6) Confirm the appropriate audible beeps when switched on for GPS calibration
                   and communications link, and directional and battery charge lighting are on.

         7) Ensure that the selected channel on the remote control is free and within range
                   of the transmitter.

                                                          6
                  8) Ensure the sensors are calibrated (when the motors are off move yaw and
                            throttle stick into upper left corner until it beeps).

                  9) Check gimbal and camera functions.

                  10) After starting the motors, check that all motors are running and rotate evenly.
                            Initiate takeoff at a low altitude and confirm all flight controls and telemetry
                            are functioning normally.

                            During Flight:

                  1) Maintain visual line of sight with aircraft at all times.

                  2) Confirm aircraft altitude is no greater than 400 feet AGL at all times.

                  3) Confirm aircraft is within 1500 lateral feet of PIC at all times.

                  4) Keep ground speeds under 43 knots at all times.

                  5) Confirm all planned flight path airspace is free of all obstacles.

                  6) Monitor battery life and properly land sUAS within 25% battery life remaining.

                  7) Flight times shall never exceed 15 minutes in length.

                  8) If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UAS will be
                            returned to the pre-determined location within the Security Perimeter and
                            land.


                  9) Land in designated and controlled landing zone and properly power down
                            aircraft and transmitter.

                            Note: Additional safety guidelines are found in (attachments 1,2,3)

        2.3 Privacy

                  Due to the extreme remoteness of proposed flight locations there is little concern
                  flights will cause invasions of privacy. All flights will occur over controlled access of
                  both public or private property with prior property owners consent. Consent will be
                  secured in situations where privacy could become a concern.

        2.4 Aircraft Safety

                  Laymon International LLC agrees to be bound by the following operational conditions
                  while conducting commercial operations and that these limitations provide for an
                  equivalent or higher level of safety under the current regulations:

                  1) The sUAS must weigh 7 pounds or less including energy source(s).

                  2) The sUAS must be flown at a ground speed not exceeding 43 knots.

                                                                 7
                   3) Flights must be operated at an altitude not to exceed 400 feet above ground
                             level (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

                   4) The sUAS must be operated within a visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and
                             visual observer (VO) at all times. The PIC must be able to use vision unaided
                             by any device other than corrective lens as specified on the PIC's U. S.
                             drivers license.

                   5) All operations must utilize a visual observer. The VO will NOT take the place
                             of the PIC in maintaining VLOS capability. The PIC and VO must be able to
                             verbally communicate at all times. The PIC will confirm that the VO can
                             perform the duties required of a VO.

                   6) The Operators manual and grant of exemption will be made available to the
                             administrator upon request. The operator must follow the procedures as
                             outlined in the operator's manual unless a discrepancy exists between the
                             conditions and limitations of the exemption in which case the conditions and
                             limitations of the exemption will take precedence and must be followed.
                             Operators and safety manuals will be made available during all sUAS flight
                             operations.

                   7) Prior to each flight the PIC must inspect the sUAS to ensure it is in a condition
                             for safe flight. If the inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe
                             operation of the UAS, the aircraft is prohibited from operating until the
                             necessary maintenance has been performed and the sUAS is found to be in
                             a condition for safe flight. The Ground Control Station, if utilized, must be
                             included in the preflight inspection. All maintenance and alterations must be
                             properly documented in the aircraft records.

                   8) The sUAS must NOT undergo any maintenance or alterations that affect the
   sUAS operation or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical 
   component.

  9) The operator must follow the manufacturer's UAS aircraft/component, 
   maintenance, overhaul, replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements.

  10) Regarding distance from non-participating persons, the operator must ensure
   that no persons are allowed within 500 feet of the area except those consenting
   to be involved and necessary for insuring safety.

  11) If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the sUAS must return
   to a pre-determined location within the security perimeter and land or be 
   recovered in accordance with the operator's manual (attachment 1).

  12) The sUAS must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or 
   emergencies in accordance with the operator's manual (attachment1,2).

  13) Each sUAS flight operation must be completed within 15 minutes flight time or
   with 25% battery power remaining, whichever occurs first.



                                                                  8
  14) All sUAS operated in accordance with an exemption must be identified by serial
   number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have an 
   identification (N Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart
   C. Markings must be as large as practicable.

  15) Any sUAS operated must comply with all manufacturer Safety Bulletins.

  16) The sUAS must remain clear and yield the right of way to all other manned 
   operations and activities at all times.

  17) Operation of sUAS must not be conducted during night. All operations must be
   conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

  18) The sUAS must not operate in Class B, C, or D airspace. The UA may not 
   operate within 5 nautical miles of the geographic center of a non-towered airport.

  19) The PIC will only be permitted to operate after demonstrating the ability to 
   operate in a safe manner including evasive and emergency maneuvers and 
   maintaining proper distances from all structures, people, vessels, and vehicles.
   Dedicated training only sessions will take place to ensure the proficiency and
   experience of the PIC and will be done so with the appropriate distance from
   non participants.

  20) The sUAS may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2000 feet
   horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the
   PIC.

  21) If the sUAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the sUAS must return
   to a predetermined controlled landing area.

  22) The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless given the weather, the sUAS
   has enough power to conduct its operation and have a minimum reserve power
   for five minutes flight time.

  23) The sUAS will display all assigned registration and identification numbers and
   markings as large as practical and in accordance with applicable CFR's.

  24) The sUAS will not be operated from any moving vehicle or device.

  25) All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled property with 
   permission from the property owner or authorized representative for each flight.

  26) NTSB will be notified within 24 hours of any incident, accident, or flight 
   transgresses of lateral or vertical boundaries.



                                                                   9

  2.5 Public Safety



  The safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft with no passengers or crew,

                   weighing considerable less than a full sized aircraft, and carrying no flammable fuel
                   load, operating under the flight conditions outlined in section 2.4, Aircraft Safety, would
                   be in the public interest. In addition, using a sUAS would reduce risk of injury to
                   personnel mapping and prospecting in remote areas where natural hazards such as
                   cliffs, ledges, ravines, and other natural obstacles commonly occur.

      3. Special Exemption Requests


         3.1 14 CFR 21(h): Airworthiness Certificates

                   Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 21(h). Based on the
                   light weight, minimal size, reduced speed, and use in controlled remote areas this
                   exemption meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety as outlined in
                   Section 333.

         3.2 14 CFR 43.7: Persons authorized to approve aircraft, airframes, aircraft
                                     engines, propellers, appliances, or component parts for return to
                                     service after maintenance, preventative maintenance,
                                     rebuilding,or alteration

                   Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 43.7 Given the
                   sUAS is more similar to a model aircraft all inspections will be done as
                   recommended by the manufacturer. All repairs other than simple propeller changes
                   will be done by the manufacturer or one of their authorized repair centers.
                   Maintenance will be preformed as outline in the manufacturer's maintenance
                   guidelines (attachment 4). All maintenance and repair will meet the requirements
                   for the equivalent level of safety pursuant to section 33 given the intended use and
                   remote location of the sUAS.

         3.3 14 CFR 43.11: Content, form, disposition of records for inspections conducted
                                      under parts 91 and 125 and 135.411(a)(1) and 135.419 of this
                                      chapter

                   Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 43.11. Currently the
                   FAA has not certified any inspections for sUAS and due to its size there is no room
                   for maintenance placards. Maintenance records will be kept on file by Laymon
                   International LLC.

         3.4 14 CFR 45.11: Marking of products

                   Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 45.11. Due to it's
                   small size and flight characteristics, fireproof placards would cause a potential
                   hazard to the aircraft with the additional weight or location.

                                                                 10
3.5 14 CFR 45.21: General

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 45.21. The FAA
         currently has no registration procedures for sUASs however if a registration number
         can be assigned, placement on the aircraft will be done in the most practical and
         visible means available.

3.6 14 CFR 45.23: Display of marks; general

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 45.23. Due to the
         small size of the sUAS full size aircraft marks are not feasible. If a designation is
         assigned by the FAA, Laymon International LLC will place assigned designation
         marks on the aircraft in the most practical and visible manner available.

3.7 14 CFR 45.25: Location of marks on fixed wing aircraft

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 45.25. The sUAS is
         a multi rotor aircraft and does not possess fix wings and as such 14 CFR 45.25 is
         inapplicable.

3.8 14 CFR 45.27: Location of marks on non fixed wing aircraft

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 45.27. Due to the
         sUASs small size it has no cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail.

3.9 14 CFR 45.29: Size of Marks

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 45.29. Due to size
         constraints of the aircraft this requirement cannot be met. However with approval of
         an exemption an aircraft mark will be affixed in the most practical locations.

3.10 14 CFR 47.3(b)(2): Registration required

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 47.3(b)(2). The FAA
         currently has no procedures for registration of an sUAS. If a registration number is
         assigned by the FAA, Laymon International LLC will place assigned designation
         marks on the aircraft in the most practical and visible manner available.

3.11 14 CFR 47.31(c): Application

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 47.3(c). Currently
         compliance for 14 CFR 47.31(c) is not possible since the FAA does not yet have
         procedures to register sUAS.

3.12 14 CFR 61.113: Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 61.113. The PIC of
         the sUAS does not possess a commercial or private pilots license.

                                                       11
         However, the proposed use of an unmanned aircraft with no passengers or crew,
         weighing considerable less than a full sized aircraft, and carrying no flammable fuel
         load, operating in remote areas, using a skilled sUAS PIC, will achieve the
         equivalent level of safety of current operations by manned aircraft with a private
         pilots license.

3.13 14 CFR 91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.7(a). Given the
         rules of operation and maintenance listed above, an equivalent level of safety can be
         achieved since no standard of air worthiness currently exists and no air worthiness
         certificate can be issued.

3.14 14 CFR 91.9(b)(c): Civil aircraft flight manual, markings, and placard
                                  requirements

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.9(b)(c). There is
         no method for approval of sUAS manuals currently, there is no place to carry such a
         manual on board the aircraft, and no pilot on board to reference it. The flight manual
         must however be kept at the ground control location for PIC reference. As referenced
         earlier due to the aircraft small size full sized marking are not possible. With an
         exemption the proper marking can however be prominently place on the sUAS in the
         most visible manner.

3.15 14 CFR 91.103(b)(2): Preflight action

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.103(b)(2). Since
         all flights are to be carried out 5 nautical miles from any airport and only in class G
         airspace CFR 91.103(b)(2) does not apply. However, preflight operations will take
         place with approval of an exemption.

3.16 14 CFR 91.105: Flight crew members at stations

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.105 as there will
         be no crew members aboard the sUAS.

3.17 14 CFR 91.109: Flight instructions, Simulated instrument flight and certain
                             flight tests

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.109. Remote
         controlled sUAS are designed or constructed without dual controls. The equivalent
         level of safety is provided by the limited size, speed, weight, and altitude of the
         aircraft in addition to no pilot or crew aboard the aircraft.

3.18 14 CFR 91.119(b)(c): Minimum safe altitudes: General

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.119(b)(c).
         Laymon International LLC will operate the sUAS at an altitude not to exceed 400 feet
         AGL for safety. With the sUAS's small size and weight an equivalent level of safety to
         manned flight can be maintained while flying closer than 500 feet from structures
         and the ground.

                                                       12
3.19 14 CFR 91.121: Altimeter readings

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 14 CFR 91.121. The
         sUAS being flown will have live feedback of altimeter and will maintain an altitude
         below 400 feet AGL at all times. With PIC and VO using line of sight operation and
         telemetry, equivalent safety levels will be met.

3.20 14 CFR 91.151: Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.151. Petitioner
         believes that an equivalent level of safety can be met by limiting flight times of the
         sUAS to 15 minutes or until 25% battery charge remains whichever is greater. Due to
         the limited flight times of a sUAS it is not possible to comply with Part 91.151.

3.21 14 CFR 91.203(a)(b): Civil aircraft: Certification required

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.203(a)(b).
         Currently there are no FAA procedures for providing an air worthiness certificate.
         With the automatic return to home feature, in the rare event of a radio control link
         disruption, the reduced speed, distance of flight, light weight, and 400 feet. AGL
         altitude limit, and no on board flight crew will combine to provide a greater degree of
         safety to the public than conventional flight operations with air worthiness
         certificates.

3.22 14 CFR 91.215: ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.215. ATC
         transponders are not commercially available in a size and weight that can be affixed
         to the sUAS and be flown safely. Given the flight operation parameters, their will be
         no need for air traffic control communication and a request for exemption is
         requested for CFR 91.215.

3.23 14 CFR 91.405(a)(d): Maintenance Required

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.405(a)(d). Since
         sUAS will be flown without passengers and these sections concern inspection
         requirements for passengers, Laymon International LLC requests an exemption. As
         noted earlier placard placement on the small form factor of an sUAS is not practical
         and also should be exempted. Log books detailing repairs and maintenance will
         be keep on file.

3.24 14 CFR 91.407: Operation after maintenance, preventive maintenance,
                             rebuilding, or alteration

         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.407. To achieve
         an equivalent level of safety Laymon International LLC will follow the maintenance
         requirements outlined in the DJI maintenance manual (attachment 4) as well as
         maintain detailed inspection and maintenance records.

                                                       13
3.25 14 CFR 91.409: Inspections
         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.409. This
         section is applicable more for large manned aircraft with longer flight times than that
         of an sUAS. Laymon International LLC believes that the pre and post flight
         inspections outlined in Section 2.2.3 above will meet the equivalent level of safety
         required.

3.26 14 CFR 91.417: Maintenance records
         Laymon International LLC requests an exemption from 14 CFR 91.417 as it
         pertains to aircraft with an air worthiness certificate. To achieve an equivalent level
         of safety Laymon International LLC will keep all maintenance records and a
         complete listing of parts replaced.

                                                       14
