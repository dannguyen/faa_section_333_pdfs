                                                      Exemption No. 11366A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0108

Mr. Norman Hirsch
Florida Aerials, LLC
422 Coral Cove Drive
North Palm Beach, FL 33408

Dear Mr. Hirsch:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 5, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Florida Aerials, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your
current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to add the DJI Phantom 3.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
                                                                                                 2

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing

requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11366
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11366 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2,
    DJI Phantom 2 Vision, and DJI Phantom 3 when weighing less than 55 pounds
    including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
    petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

       This is to request an amendment to this Exemption No. 11366 to      Norman Hirsch
       add an additional UAV, DJI Phantom 3 Professional, to our           Mailing Address:
       existing UAVs (DJI Phantom 2 Vision and DJI Phantom 2). The         422 Coral Cove Dr.
       DJI Phantom 3 Professional is basically the newest version of       City:
       the DJI Phantom with better video and improved location holding     Juno Beach
       capabilities and some other improvements including a 4cell          Country:
       smart battery replacing the 3cell battery of the Phantom 2's. The   United States
       form factor, sizes and weights are virtually the same for the DJI   ZIP/Postal Code:
       Phantom 2, DJI Phantom 2 Vision and the new DJI Phantom 3           33408
       models.                                                             Organization Name:

       This amendment is not requesting any change to any of the
       existing 31 paragraphs of Conditions and Limitations other than               Comments
       Paragraph 1 where DJI Phantom 3 Professional would be added
       in the first sentence, eg: "Operations authorized by this grant of              0
       exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3 Professional, DJI
       Phantom 2 and DJI Phantom 2 Vision when weighing less than             Comments Received *
       55 pounds including payload.". The rest of the Exemption would
       not require any changes.                                                Docket Information

       The Certificate of Waiver or Authorization would also have DJI      This document is contained in
       Phantom 3 added to the OPERATIONS AUTHORIZED section,
       eg: Operation of the DJI Phantom 3 Professional, DJI Phantom        FAA20150108
       2 and DJI Phantom Vision Unmanned Aircraft Systems at or
       below 200 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) for the purpose of          Related Dockets:
       aerial data collection.                                             None

       All the statements made in our original petition would also remain  Related RINs:
       unchanged with the exception of the "DJI Phantom 3
       Professional" model being added where the other models are                                         1/2
       listed.
