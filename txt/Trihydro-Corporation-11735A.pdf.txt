                                                      Exemption No. 11735A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0854

Ms. Deby L. Forry
Senior Vice President of Risk Management and CFO
Trihydro Corporation
1252 Commerce Drive
Laramie, WY 82070

Dear Ms. Forry:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated June 10, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Trihydro Corporation (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your
current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to add the DJI S1000, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3 Professional aircraft.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
                                                                                                 2

has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing

requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11735
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11735 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Altavian Nova
    R8400, DJI S1000, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3 Professional when weighing less
    than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will
    require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on May 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Re: Application for Amendment to Exemption No. 11735 Issued to Trihydro Corporation
           (Docket No. FAA-2015-0854)

Dear Madam or Sir:

Trihydro Corporation was issued Exemption No. 11735 on June 2, 2015 (the "Exemption"), for operation
of the Altavian Nova R8400 Unmanned Aircraft System for the purpose of conducting aerial acquisitions
and research.

Trihydro hereby requests an amendment to the Exemption to include the following additional models of
UAS under the same terms and conditions contained in the Exemption:

     1. DJIS-1000

     2. DJI Inspire 1

     3. DJI Phantom 3 Professional

The Pilot Operating Handbooks for these three additional UAS have been submitted to FAA Docket No.
FAA-2015-0854. Operations of these additional UAS will be in full compliance with the terms of
Exemption No. 11735 and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective Pilot Operating
Handbooks.

The FAA has granted exemptions in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in this
petition for amendment. See Exemption No. 11732 to Terraplane, LLC (Docket No. FAA-2015-0007)
(granting petition for exemption for the DJI S-1 000 for the purpose of aerial acquisition and research). See
also Exemption No. 11310A to Mr. Colin Hinkle (Docket No. FAA-2014-0608) (granting petition for
amendment to add the DJI Inspire 1 and DJI Phantom 3 to previous exemption granted for aerial data
collection).

Trihydro refers the FAA to its original Petition for Exemption dated March 26, 2015 (Docket No. FAA-
2015-0854) for a listing of the regulations for which an exemption is being sought, a demonstration of the
public interest, and a showing of an equivalent level of safety. There have been no changes in the conditions
and reasons relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original Exemption.

Trihydro respectfully suggests that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of this petition for
amendment in the Federal Register because the requested amendment would not set a precedent.

If you have any questions or need additional information to process this petition for amendment, please
contact me at (307) 745-7474, or by email at dforry@trihydro.com.

Sincerely,
Trihydro Corporation
