                                                      Exemption No. 11250A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0840

Irvine, CA 92612

Dear Mr. Fraidenburgh:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 6, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Videe This! Inc. dba Yeah Drones (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an
amendment to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c),
61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection and closed set motion picture and filming. You requested an amendment to add the
DJI Inspire 1 and DJI Phantom 3.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                  2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11250
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11250 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI S900, DJI
         Phantom 2, DJI Inspire 1, and DJI Phantom 3 when weighing less than 55 pounds
         including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
         petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

         Re: Request for Amendment to Exemption No. 11250 on Behalf of Videe This! Inc.
                  dba Yeah Drones (Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0840)

Dear Ms. Cooper:

         This is a request for an amendment to the existing Section 333 Exemption No. 11250 to
add additional aircraft to the exemption-holder's authorized commercial operations. On April 1,
2015, the FAA granted this Petition for Exemption to operate small unmanned aircraft systems
for the purpose of aerial filming and photography. The Petitioner now seeks an amendment to its
exemption authorizing the operation of additional aircraft as described in the confidential and
proprietary operations manuals submitted in support of this amendment request.

         Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me
if you should have any questions.

                                                    Best regards,
