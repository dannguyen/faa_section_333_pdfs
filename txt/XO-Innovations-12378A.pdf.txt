                                                           Exemption No. 12378A
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0344

Mr. Milton Amaya

Bakersfield, CA 93312

Dear Mr. Amaya:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated February 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of XO Innovations (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography for industrial, real estate, agriculture, motion picture, and television industry for
scripted closed set filming. In the August 6, 2015 decision letter, the FAA was unable to
approve the DJI Matrice 100. The FAA is now prepared to act on that request.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight, speed
and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
                                                                                                 2

Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 12378
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 12378 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3,
    DJI Inspire 1, 3DR Aero-M, and DJI Matrice 100 when weighing less than 55 pounds
    including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a new
    petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on August 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,
/s/
John S. Duncan
Director, Flight Standards Service

Dear UAS Integration at Federal Aviation Administration,

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act) and
14 CFR Part 11, XO Innovations, Inc., a research developer and operator of Small Unmanned Aircraft
Systems ("UASs") equipped to conduct aerial photography for industrial, Real State, agriculture, motion
picture, and Television industry for scripted closed set filming, hereby applies for an exemption from the
listed

Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of its UASs (Fixed-wing &
Multi-Rotor), so long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein
or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333.

As described more fully below, the requested exemption would permit the operation of small,
unmanned and relatively inexpensive UAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is 1) limited 2)
predetermined 3) controlled as to access and 4) would provide safety enhancements to the already safe
operations in the industrial, film, and television production community presently using conventional and
unmanned aircraft. Approval of this exemption would thereby enhance safety and fulfill the FAA
Administrator's responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems in the national airspace system." Section 333 (c) of the Reform Act. The conditions proposed by
the applicant are drawn from Order 8900.1 CHG 0, Volume 3, Chapter 8 Issue a Certificate of Waiver for
industrial, agriculture, Real State, motion picture, and Television industry.

Privacy

All flights will occur over private and controlled access property with the property owner's prior consent
and knowledge. Image capture of people will rarely take place, but in the event they are, they will have
consented prior to being filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where data collection will
take place.

Airborne (Day & Night)

With regard to airborne XO Innovations ("XO") adheres to all FAA regulations. Further XO airborne
teams operate under the principals of: Safety First, Quality Assurance, Accountability, Reporting, and
Training. When approved by the FAA it is XO' mandate to treat all UAS operations the exact same as that
of conventional aircraft.

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of UASs in the industrial, agriculture, Real
State, motion picture, and Television industry will enhance safety by reducing risk. Conventional
operations, using jet or piston powered aircraft, operate at extremely low altitudes just feet from the
subject being in extreme proximity to people and structures; and present the risks associated with
vehicles that weigh in the neighborhood of 4,000lbs., carrying large amounts of Jet A or other fuel (193
gallons for jet helicopter shown below). Such aircraft must fly to and from location. In contrast, a UAS
weighing fewer than 55lbs and powered by batteries eliminates virtually all of the risk given the
substantial reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on board.

The UAS is typically transported to the location via auto or cargo van in a medium sized case and is never
flown to set. The UAS will carry no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks
associated with manned aircraft flights.

The operation of small UASs, weighting less than 55lbs., conducted in the strict conditions outlined
above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exemptions requested
herein, including exempting the applicant from the requirements of Part 21 and allowing commercial
operations. These lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to the ground, and in a sterile
environment and, as a result, are far safer than ground than conventional operations conducted with
turbine helicopters operating in close proximity to the ground and people.

The primary used of interest for XO Innovations utilizing UASs are as fallow:

Visual inspections, Photo and Video of:

         1. Gas and Oil Wells
         2. Agriculture Land Mapping
         3. Real State
         4. Telecommunications Towers
         5. Power lines
         6. Structural Integrity
         7. Motion Picture
         8. Television Industry

It is estimated that the use of UAS aircraft will reduce hazardous tower climbs Poles Wells etc, Aside
from reducing the number of physical climbs, the utilization of UAS will dramatically lower the use of
cranes and lifts, which also pose dangerous conditions for build and repair personnel. In a number of
instances, inspectors just need to get "eyes on" the tower top assemblies to look for specific
deficiencies. With regard to power lines when climbers are sent in the power must be deferred. The use
of UAS may allow these industries to fill in the data gaps where traditional aircraft are currently
restricted.

It is anticipated that the airborne image capture process will be accomplished in both day and night
environments. Currently, conventional aircraft are flown in highly populated and/or urban areas, with
turbine powered helicopters. The grant of this exemption request will provide improved safety in both
day and night operations. To capture the highest quality of resolution the majority of airborne data
collections will take place during the 10:00am ­ 4:00pm window.

There may be night operations conducted where infrared sensors will be deployed. If such operations
are required the ground facilities and the subject tower/Pole/Wells assemblies may require additional
lighting so that visibility is as though it was conducted during daylight hours.

This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section
333 (a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This directs the FAA to consider whether certain unmanned
aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system (NAS) before completion of the
rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In making this determination, the FAA is
required to determine which types of UASs do not create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or
pose a threat to national security in light of the following:

                                      10913 Dee Dee Ave, Bakersfield, CA 93312
                                                       661-747-3612

                                                www.xoinnovations.com
. The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability:
. Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
. Operation of the UAS within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) of the Operator (PIC) and Observers.

Reform Act §333 (a). Lastly, if the FAA determines that such vehicles "may operate safely in the national
airspace system, the FAA shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft in the
national airspace system." Id. §333 (c) (emphasis added).
The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This statutory
authority by its terms includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under
§40101 of the Act, the mat includes UASs, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must have a
current airworthiness certificate. The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a
regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of this title
if the Administrator finds the exemption in the public interest.
49 U.S.C. §44704; 14 CFR §91.203 (a) (1).

Applicant interprets this provision to place of the duty on the Administrator to not only process
applications for exemptions under section 333, but for the Administrator to craft conditions herein for
the safe operation of the UAS, if it should be determined that the conditions set forth herein do not
fulfill the statutory requirements for approval.

XO Innovations' UASs are multi-rotorcraft and fixed-wing aircraft, weighing 55 or fewer lbs. including
sensor payload. They operate their multi-rotorcraft, under normal conditions at a speed of no more than
50 knots and have the capability to hover, and move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously.
They operate their fixed-wing aircraft, under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 50 knots and
primarily have the flight characteristics of traditional airplanes. They will manually operate only in VLOS
and will operate only within the sterile area described in the Confidential: Flight Operations Manual
(FOM) attached as Exhibit 1 (hereinafter "the Manual").3 Adherence to the Manual will insure that the
UAS will "not create a hazard to the national airspace system or the public.

Given the small size and weight of the UAS involved and the restricted sterile environment within which
they will operate, the applicant falls squarely within that zone of safety (an equivalent level of safety) in
which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by exemption, allow commercial operations of UASs to
commence immediately. Also due to the size of the UASs and the restricted areas in which the relevant
UAS will operate, approval of the application presents no national security issue. Given the clear
direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal Aviation Act, as
amended; the strong equivalent level of safety, surrounding the proposed operations, and significant
public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental impacts, including reduced
emissions associated with allowing UASs for inspection and survey operations, the grant of the
requested exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly, the applicant respectfully requests that the
FAA grant the requested exemption without delay.

The Flight Operation Manual is presented as an applicant confidential document under 14
CFR 11.35 (b) as the entire manual contains proprietary methods and information that the applicant has
not and will not share with others. The manual reflects learned experiences, methods, operating
conditions, and procedures that are not available to the public and are protected from release under the
Freedom of Information Act 5 USC 552 et.seq. Reform Act Section 333 (b)

AIRCRAFT AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY

The applicant proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These limitations provide for at least
an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations under the current regulatory structure
because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to the already safe Videography and
Photography operations conducted with conventional aircraft. These limitations and condition to which
XO Innovations agrees to be bound when conducting commercial operations under an FAA issued
exemption include:

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 CFR §91.203 (a) (1)

Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements for the issuance
of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1). Given the size and limited operating area
associated with the aircraft to be utilized by the Applicant, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H meets
the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the Reform Act. The
Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. §44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the FAA to
exempt aircraft from the requirement capability, and proximity to airports and populated areas of the
particular UAS. In all cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the UAS operated without an
airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed will be at
least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft (fixed-wing or multi-rotorcraft) operating with an
airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

The UAS to be operated hereunder is less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a Pilot nor Observers,
carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exclusively within a secured area
as set out in the Manual. Unlike other civil aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly
controlled and monitored by both the Operator, pursuant to safety requirements, and under the
requirements and in compliance with local public safety requirements, to provide security for the area
of operation as is now done with conventional tools. The FAA will have advance notice of all operations.
These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in connection with
Videography and Photography production, provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property
owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C.F.R.
Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria demonstrates that there is no credible
threat to national security posed by the UAS, due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation,
lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and inability to carry a substantial external load.

14 CFR §45.23 (B): Marking of the Aircraft

The regulation requires:

The registration number is displayed on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or
experimental or provisionally certificated aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near
each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 6
inches high, the words "limited," "restricted", "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as
applicable.

Even though the UAS will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be needed as the UAS
will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the word "Experimental" can be
placed. Given the size of the sUAV, two-inch lettering will be impossible. The word "Experimental" will
be placed on the fuselage in compliance with §45.29 (f).

The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the sUAV marked on its fuselage as required by
§45.29 (f) where the Operator (PIC) and Observers and others working with the sUAV will see the
identification of the UAS as "Experimental." The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this
regulation to Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations -Pilot in Command (PIC)

Sections 61.113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because the UAS will not
carry a Pilot or Observers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent level of safety of current
operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have a private pilot's license rather than a
commercial pilot's license to operate this small UAS. Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the
Operator (PIC) and Observers, the UAS is remotely controlled with no living thing on board. The area of
operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance as set forth
in the Manual. The level of safety provided by the requirements included in the Manual exceeds that

14 CFR §91.7 (a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy condition. As
there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this exemption be granted, no
FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft and the
requirements contained in the Manual for maintenance and use of safety check lists and a preflight
inspection, all maintenance and alterations will be properly documented in the aircraft records prior to
each flight, an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

14 CFR §91.9 (b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the Aircraft

Section 91.9 (b) (2) provides:

No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft ...

(2) For which an Airplane or Multi-rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of this chapter,
unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved Airplane or Multi-rotorcraft Flight Manual,
approved manual material, markings, and placards, or any combination thereof.
The UAS, given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight manual on the
aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no room or capacity to carry
such an item on the aircraft.

The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the ground control
point where the pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to it. The FAA has issued the following
exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299,
9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A 10602, 32827, and 10700

14 CFR §91.103: Preflight Action

This regulation requires each pilot in command to take certain actions before flight to insure the safety
of flight. As FAA approved multi-rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided for the aircraft an
exemption will be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be provided in the Manual. The PIC will take
all actions including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing and takeoff distances and
aircraft performance data before initiation of flight.

14 CFR §91.109: Flight Instruction

Section 91.103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon) that
is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls. UASs and
remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control is
accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft via radio
communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training without fully functional dual
controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in experimental aircraft. See Exemptions Nos.
5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of safety provided by the fact that aircraft.

14 CFR §91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119 (d) allows
helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person operating the
helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the
FAA. As this exemption is for a UAS that is a fixed-wing or multi-rotorcraft requests authority to operate
at altitudes up to 400 ft. AGL, or not more than 200 ft. above an elevated platform from which filming
inspections is planned, an exemption may be needed to allow such operations. As set forth herein,
except for the limited conditions stated in the Manual, the UAS will never operate at higher than 400 ft.
AGL. It will however be operated in restricted area with security perimeter, where buildings and people
will not be exposed to operations without their pre-obtained consent.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the UAS as well as
location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the permission of the property owner or
local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property owner and participants in the filming
activity, all affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations as set forth in the Manual.
Compared to flight operations with aircraft or multi-rotorcraft weighing far more than the maximum 55
lbs. proposed herein and the lack of flammable fuel, any risk associated with these operations is far less
than those presently presented with conventional aircraft operating at or below 500 ft. AGL in this
industry. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the UAS will ensure separation between these small
UAS operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.

14 CFR §91.121: Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by reference to
an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate altimeter setting
available before departure." As the UAS may not have a barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude
read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator,
pursuant to the Manual and Safety Check list, confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the
GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR §91.151 (a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions

Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions
unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of
intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ (1) During the day, to fly after that for at least
30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes."

The battery powering the UAS provides approximately 40 minutes of powered flight. To meet the 30
minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR §91.151, UAS flights would be limited to approximately 10
minutes in length. Given the limitations on the UAS's proposed flight area and the location of its
proposed operations within a predetermined area, a longer time frame for flight in daylight or night VFR
conditions is reasonable.

Applicant believes that an exemption from 14 CFR §91.151 (a) falls within the scope of prior exemptions.
See Exemption 10673 (allowing Lockheed Martin Corporation to operate without compliance with FAR
91.151 (a)). Operating the small UAS, in a tightly controlled area where only people and property owners
or official representatives who have signed waivers will be allowed, with less than 30 minutes of
reserved fuel, does not engender the type of risks that Section 91.151 (a) was intended to alleviate given
the size and speed of the small UAS. Additionally, limiting UAS flights to 10 minutes would greatly
reduce the utility for which the exemption will be granted.

Applicant believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 30 minutes or
25% of battery power whichever happens first. This restriction would be more than adequate return the
UAS to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its limited operating area.

14 CFR §91.203 (a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration

The regulation provides in pertinent part:

         (a) Except as provided in §91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within it
              the following:
              (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

         (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
              paragraph (b) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is
              displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

The UAS fully loaded weighs no more than 55 lbs. and is operated without an onboard Pilot. As such,
there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or to display them on the
UAS.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground control point
where the Pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to them, to the extent they are applicable to
the UAS.

14 CFR §91.405 (a); 407 (a) (2); 417 (a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as provided in
paragraph © of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in Part 43 of this chapter...," and
others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, these
sections will not apply to the applicant. Maintenance will be accomplished by the operator pursuant to
the flight manual and operating handbook as referenced in the Manufactures Manual. An equivalent
level of safety will be achieved because these small UASs are very limited in size and will carry a small
payload and operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise the
UAS can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 ft. AGL. As provided in the
Manual, the operator will ensure that the UAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform
required maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the operator is the

to provide the equivalent level of safety.
Pursuant to 14 CFR Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal
Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:
Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:
14 CFR § 21, subpart H; 14 CFR § 45.23 (b); 14 CFR § 61.113 (a) & (b); 91.7 (a); 91.9 (b) (2);

91.103 (b); 91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151 (a); 91.203 (a) & (b); 91.405 (a); 91.407 (a) (1);
91.409 (a) (2) and 91.417 (a) & (b) to operate commercially a small unmanned vehicle (55lbs or less) in
industrial area and industrial operations.
Summary
Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size, weight, speed,
operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation within visual line of sight
and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the grant of the requested
exemptions allowing commercial operation of applicant's UAS in the industrial, Videography and
Photography production industry pursuant to the Manual appended hereto. XO is eagerly standing by to
support the FAA and UAS community in its quest to establish proper regulations and protocols for the
safe introduction of unmanned aircraft into the national airspace.
