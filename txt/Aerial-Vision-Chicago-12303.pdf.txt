                                                           Exemption No. 12303
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1188

Mr. Anthony W. LaRosa
Aerial Vision Chicago, LLC
6747 North Kolmar Avenue
Lincolnwood, IL 60712

Dear Mr. LaRosa:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 22, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Aerial Vision Chicago, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and cinematography.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. However, the FAA
received two comments in support of the petition made to the docket.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner are the DJI Inspire 1 and DJI Phantom 3.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
                                                                                                                 2

consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Aerial Vision Chicago, LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Aerial Vision Chicago, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 and
    DJI Phantom 3 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
                                                                                                            4

    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

This  exemption  application  is  expressly  submitted  to  fulfill  Congress'  goal  in  passing  Section  
333(a)  through  (c)  of  the  Reform  Act.  This  law  directs  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  to  
consider  whether  certain  unmanned  aircraft  systems  may  operate  safely  in  the  national  
airspace  system  (NAS)  before  completion  of  the  rule  making  required  under  Section  332  of  
the  Reform  Act.  In  making  this  determination,  the  Secretary  is  required  to  determine  which  
types  of  UASs  do  not  create  a  hazard  to  users  of  the  NAS  or  the  public  or  pose  a  threat  to  
national  security  in  light  of  the  following:    

                  · The  UAS's  size,  weight,  speed  and  operationalcapability;  
                  · Operation  of  the  UAS  in  close  proximity  to  airports  and  populatedareas;  and

Aerial  Vision  Chicago  proposes  to  use  two  sUASs;  1)  DJI  Inspire  1    &    2)  DJI  PHANTOM  3  
Advanced  Both  of  these  aircrafts  has  four  rotors  and  four  motors  in  a  quadcopter  
configuration  (X4).  Both  sUASs  weigh  less  than  55  lbs.  including  payload.  They  operate,  
under  normal  conditions  at  a  speed  of  no  more  than  50  knots  and  have  the  capability  to  
hover,  and  move  in  the  vertical  and  horizontal  plane  simultaneously.  Both  sUASs  are  
equipped  with  GPS  and  auto-return  function  to  the  predetermined  safe  landing  area  as  well  
as  allowing  reading  of  magnetic  interference  that  can  cause  loss  off  GPS  signal.  The  sUASs  
will  operate  only  in  line  of  sight  and  will  operate  only  within  a  sterile  closed-set  area  of  a  
residential  or  commercial  listing  or  a  closed-set  special  event.  Such  operations  will  insure  
that  the  sUASs  will  "not  create  a  hazard  to  users  of  the  national  airspace  system  or  the  
public."  (Reform  Act  Section  333  (b)).  
  
Given  the  small  size  of  the  sUASs  involved  and  the  restricted  sterile  environment  within  
which  they  will  operate,  the  applicant  falls  squarely  within  that  zone  of  safety  (an  equivalent  
level  of  safety)  in  which  Congress  envisioned  that  the  FAA  must,  by  exemption,  allow  
commercial  operations  of  UASs  to  commence  immediately.Also  due  to  the  size  of  the  UASs  
and  the  restricted  areas  in  which  the  relevant  sUASs  will  operate,  approval  of  the  
application  presents  no  national  security  issue.  Given  the  clear  direction  in  Section  333  of  
the  Reform  Act,  the  authority  contained  in  the  Federal  Aviation  Act,  as  amended;  the  strong  
equivalent  level  of  safety  surrounding  the  proposed  operations,  and  the  significant  public  
benefit,  including  enhanced  safety,  reduction  in  environmental  impacts,  including  reduced  
emissions  associated  with  allowing  UASs  for  movie  and  television  operations,  the  grant  of  
the  requested  exemptions  is  in  the  public  interest.  Accordingly,  the  applicant  respectfully  
requests  that  the  FAA  grant  the  requested  exemption  without  delay.  
  
AIRCRAFT  AND  EQUIVALENT  LEVEL  OF  SAFETY  
  
Aerial  Vision  Chicago  proposes  that  the  exemption  requested  herein  apply  to  civil  aircraft  
that  have  the  characteristics  and  that  operate  with  the  limitations  listed  herein.  These  
limitations  provide  for  at  least  an  equivalent  or  even  higher  level  of  safety  to  operations  
under  the  current  regulatory  structure  because  the  proposed  operations  represent  a  safety  
enhancement  to  the  already  safe  aerial  photography  and  cinematography  filming  operations  
conducted  with  conventional  aircraft.  
  
These  limitations  and  conditions  to  which  Aerial  Vision  Chicago  agrees  to  be  bound  when  
conducting  commercial  operations  under  an  FAA  issued  exemption  include:  

    Ø The  sUAS  will  weigh  less  than  55  lbs.    
    Ø Flights  will  be  operated  within  line  of  sight  of  a  pilot  and/or  observer.    
    Ø Maximum  total  flight  time  for  each  operational  flight  will  be  30  minutes  or  less.    
    Ø Flights  will  be  terminated  at  25%  battery  power  reserve  should  that  occur  prior  to  

         the  30  minute  limit.    
    Ø Flights  will  be  operated  at  an  altitude  of  no  more  than  400  feet  AGL  or,  not  more  than  

         200  feet  above  an  elevated  platform  for  which  filming  is  planned.    
    Ø Minimum  crew  for  each  operation  will  consist  of  the  sUAS  Pilot,  the  Visual  Observer,  

         and  the  Camera  Operator.    
    Ø sUAS  Pilot  will  also  meet  the  flight  review  requirements  specified  in  14  C.F.R  61.56  in  

         an  aircraft  in  which  the  Pilot  is  rated  on  his  or  her  pilot  certificate.    
         Anthony  W.  LaRosa  -  C:  +1  773  701  2559  -  Anthony@aerialvisionchicago.com  
  

    Ø The  sUAS  will  only  operate  within  a  confined  sterile  closed-set  area  with  a  set  safety  
         perimeter,  the  boundaries  of  which  will  be  determined  by  production  personnel  and  
         the  sUAS  PIC  based  on  the  site-specific  filming  activities  and  speed  of  the  sUAS  
         required  for  the  operation,  and  coordinated  with  the  jurisdictional  FAA  FSDO  and  
         local  government  officials  as  applicable.    

    Ø A  briefing  will  be  conducted  in  regards  to  the  planned  sUAS  operations  prior  to  each  
         day's  production  activities.  It  will  be  mandatory  that  all  personnel  who  will  be  
         performing  duties  within  the  boundaries  of  the  safety  perimeter  be  present  for  this  
         briefing.  

    Ø The  sUAS  Pilot  and/or  Aerial  Coordinator  will  ensure  this  safety  perimeter  that  only  
         consenting  production  personnel  will  be  allowed  within  100  feet  of  the  sUAS  
         operation  by  not  permitting  anyone  who  had  not  been  briefed  or  whom  is  not  
         involved  in  production  to  be  in  the  closed-set  area.    

    Ø Observer  and  PIC  will  at  all  times  be  able  to  communicate  by  voice  and/or  two  way  
         radio  communication  system.    

    Ø Written  and/or  oral  permission  from  the  relevant  property  holders  will  be  obtained.    
    Ø If  applicable,  all  required  permissions  and  permits  will  be  obtained  from  territorial,  

         state,  county  or  city  jurisdictions,  including  local  law  enforcements,  fire,  or  other  
         appropriate  governmental  agencies.    
    Ø If  the  sUAS  loses  communications  or  loses  its  GPS  signal,  the  sUAS  will  have  the  
         capability  to  return  to  a  pre-determined  location  within  the  Security  Perimeter  and  
         land  safely.    
    Ø The  sUAS  will  have  the  capability  to  abort  flight  in  case  of  unpredicted  obstacles  or  
         emergencies.    
  
14  C.F.R.  Part  21,  Subpart  H:  Airworthiness  Certificates  14  C.F.R.  §91.203  (a)  (1)  
Subpart  H,  entitled  Airworthiness  Certificates,  establishes  the  procedural  requirements  for  
the  issuance  of  airworthiness  certificates  as  required  by  FAR  §91.203  (a)  (1).  Given  the  size  
and  limited  operating  area  associated  with  the  aircraft  to  be  utilized  by  the  Applicant,  an  
exemption  from  Part  21  Subpart  H  meets  the  requirements  of  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  
under  Part  11  and  Section  333  of  the  Reform  Act.The  Federal  Aviation  Act  (49  U.S.C.§44701  
(f))  and  Section  333  of  the  Reform  Act  both  authorize  the  FAA  to  exempt  aircraft  from  the  
requirement  for  an  airworthiness  certificate,  upon  consideration  of  the  size,  weight,  speed,  
operational  capability,  and  proximity  to  airports  and  populated  areas  of  the  particular  UAS.  
In  all  cases,  an  analysis  of  these  criteria  demonstrates  that  the  UAS  operated  without  an  
airworthiness  certificate,  in  the  restricted  environment  and  under  the  conditions  proposed  
will  be  at  least  as  safe,  or  safer,  than  a  conventional  aircraft  (fixed  wing  or  rotorcraft)  
operating  with  an  airworthiness  certificate  without  the  restrictions  and  conditions  
proposed.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §  45.23  (b).  Marking  of  the  Aircraft  
The  regulation  requires:  
When  marks  include  only  the  Roman  capital  letter  "N"  and  the  registration  number  is  
displayed  on  limited,  restricted  or  light-sport  category  aircraft  or  experimental  or  
provisionally  certificated  aircraft,  the  operator  must  also  display  on  that  aircraft  near  each  
entrance  to  the  cabin,  cockpit,  or  pilot  station,  in  letters  not  less  than  2  inches  nor  more  than

6  inches  high,  the  words  "limited,"  "restricted,"  "light-sport,"  "experimental,"  or  
"provisional,"  as  applicable.  
Even  though  the  sUAS  will  have  no  airworthiness  certificate,  an  exemption  may  be  needed  
as  the  sUAS  will  have  no  entrance  to  the  cabin,  cockpit  or  pilot  station  on  which  the  word  
"experimental"  can  be  placed.  Given  the  size  of  the  sUAS,  two  inch  lettering  will  be  
impossible.  The  word  "Experimental"  will  be  placed  on  the  fuselage  in  compliance  with  
§45.29  (f).  
  
The  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  provided  by  having  the  sUAS  marked  on  its  fuselage  as  
required  by  §45.92  (f)  where  the  pilot,  observer  and  others  working  with  the  sUAS  will  see  
the  identification  of  the  sUAS  as  "Experimental".  The  FAA  has  issued  the  following  
exemptions  to  this  regulation  to  Exemptions  Nos.  10700,  8738,  10167  and  10167A.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §91.7(a):  Civil  aircraft  airworthiness.  
The  regulation  requires  that  no  person  may  operate  a  civil  aircraft  unless  it  is  in  airworthy  
condition.As  there  will  be  no  airworthiness  certificate  issued  for  the  aircraft,  should  this  
exemption  be  granted,  no  FAA  regulatory  standard  will  exist  for  determining  airworthiness.  
Given  the  size  of  the  aircraft  and  the  requirements  contained  in  the  Manual  for  maintenance  
and  use  of  safety  check  lists  prior  to  each  flight,  as  set  forth  in  Sections  J,  L  and  Q,  an  
equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  provided.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §  91.9  (b)  (2):  Civil  Aircraft  Flight  Manual  in  the  Aircraft.  
Section  91.9  (b)  (2)  provides:
No  person  may  operate  a  U.S.-registered  civil  aircraft  ...  
The  sUAS,  given  its  size  and  configuration  has  no  ability  or  place  to  carry  such  a  flight  
manual  on  the  aircraft,  not  only  because  there  is  no  pilot  on  board,  but  because  there  is  no  
room  or  capacity  to  carry  such  an  item  on  the  aircraft.The  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  
maintained  by  keeping  the  flight  manual  at  the  ground  control  point  where  the  pilot  flying  
the  sUAS  will  have  immediate  access  to  it.The  FAA  has  issued  the  following  exemptions  to  
this  regulation:  Exemption  Nos.  8607,  8737,  8738,  9299,  9299A,  9565,  9565B,  10167,  
10167A,  10602,  32827,  and  10700.  
(2)  For  which  an  Airplane  or  Rotorcraft  Flight  Manual  is  not  required  by  §21.5  of  this  
chapter,  unless  there  is  available  in  the  aircraft  a  current  approved  airplane  or  Rotorcraft  
Flight  Manual,  approved  manual  material,  markings,  and  placards,  or  any  combination  
thereof.  
14  C.F.R.  §  91.103:  Preflight  action  
This  regulation  requires  each  pilot  in  command  to  take  certain  actions  before  flight  to  insure  
the  safety  of  flight.As  FAA  approved  rotorcraft  flight  manuals  will  not  be  provided  for  the  
aircraft  an  exemption  will  be  needed.  An  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  set  forth  by  the  
pre-flight  checklist  as  set  forth  in  the  Flight  Operations  Manual.The  PIC  will  take  all  actions  
including  reviewing  weather,  flight  battery  requirements,  landing  and  takeoff  distances,  
aircraft  performance  data  and  setting  the  pre-determined  safe  landing  area  in  case  of  loss  of  
GPS  communication  before  initiation  of  flight.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §91.109:  Flight  instruction:  
Section  91.103  provides  that  no  person  may  operate  a  civil  aircraft  (except  a  manned  free  
balloon)  that  is  being  used  for  flight  instruction  unless  that  aircraft  has  fully  functioning

dual  controls.  sUASs  and  remotely  piloted  aircraft,  by  their  design  do  not  have  fully  
functional  dual  controls.  Flight  control  is  accomplished  through  the  use  of  a  control  box  that  
communicates  with  the  aircraft  via  radio  communications.The  FAA  has  approved  
exemptions  for  flight  training  without  fully  functional  dual  controls  for  a  number  of  aircraft  
and  for  flight  instruction  in  experimental  aircraft.  See  Exemption  Nos.5778K  &  9862A.The  
equivalent  level  of  safety  provided  by  the  fact  that  neither  a  pilot  nor  passengers  will  be  
carried  in  
the  aircraft  and  by  the  size  and  speed  of  the  aircraft.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §91.119:  Minimum  safe  altitudes  
Section  91.119  establishes  safe  altitudes  for  operation  of  civil  aircraft.  Section  91.119  (d)  
allows  helicopters  to  be  operated  at  less  than  the  minimums  prescribed,  provided  the  
person  operating  the  helicopter  complies  with  any  route  or  altitudes  prescribed  for  
helicopters  by  the  FAA.As  this  exemption  is  for  a  sUAS  that  is  a  helicopter  and  the  exemption  
requests  authority  to  operate  at  altitudes  up  to  400  AGL,  or  not  more  than  200  above  an  
elevated  platform  from  which  filming  is  planned,  an  exemption  may  be  needed  to  allow  such  
operations.The  sUAS  will  never  operate  at  higher  than  400  AGL.  It  will  however  be  operated  
in  a  restricted  area  with  security  perimeter,  where  buildings  and  people  will  not  be  exposed  
to  operations  without  their  pre-obtained  consent.  
The  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  achieved  given  the  size,  weight,  speed  of  the  UAS  as  
well  as  the  location  where  it  is  operated.  No  flight  will  be  taken  without  the  permission  of  
the  property  owner  or  local  officials.  Because  of  the  advance  notice  to  the  property  owner  
and  participants  in  the  filming  activity,  all  affected  individuals  will  be  aware  of  the  planned  
flight  operations.  Compared  to  flight  operations  with  aircraft  or  rotorcraft  weighting  far  
more  than  the  maximum  55lbs.  proposed  herein  and  the  lack  of  flammable  fuel,  any  risk  
associated  with  these  operations  is  far  less  than  those  presently  presented  with  
conventional  aircraft  operating  at  or  below  500  AGL  in  aerial  photography  and  
cinematography  industry.  In  addition,  the  low-  altitude  operations  of  the  sUAS  will  ensure  
separation  between  these  sUAS  operations  and  the  operations  of  conventional  aircraft  that  
must  comply  with  Section  91.119.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §91.121  Altimeter  Settings  
This  regulation  requires  each  person  operating  an  aircraft  to  maintain  cruising  altitude  by  
reference  to  an  altimeter  that  is  set  "...to  the  elevation  of  the  departure  airport  or  an  
appropriate  altimeter  setting  available  before  departure."  As  the  sUAS  may  not  have  a  
barometric  altimeter,  but  instead  a  GPS  altitude  read  out,  an  exemption  may  be  needed.  An  
equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  achieved  by  the  operator,  pursuant  to  the  Pre  Flight  Check  
list,  confirming  the  altitude  of  the  launch  site  shown  on  the  GPS  altitude  indicator  before  
flight.  
14  C.F.R.  §  91.151(a):  Fuel  Requirements  for  Flight  in  VFR  Conditions  
Section  91.151  (a)  prohibits  an  individual  from  beginning  "a  flight  in  an  airplane  under  VFR  
conditions  unless  (considering  wind  and  forecast  weather  conditions)  there  is  enough  fuel  
to  fly  to  the  first  point  of  intended  landing,  and,  assuming  normal  cruising  speed  ­  (1)  
During  the  day,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  least  30  minutes;  or  (2)  At  night,  to  fly  after  that  for  at  
least  45  minutes."

The  battery  powering  the  sUAS  provides  approximately  40  minutes  of  powered  flight.  To  
meet  the  30  minute  reserve  requirement  in  14  CFR  §91.151,  sUAS  flights  would  be  limited  
to  approximately  10  minutes  in  length.  Given  the  limitations  on  the  UAS's  proposed  flight  
area  and  the  location  of  its  proposed  operations  within  a  predetermined  area,  a  longer  time  
frame  for  flight  in  daylight  or  night  VFR  conditions  is  reasonable.  
Aerial  Vision  Chicago  believes  that  an  exemption  from  14  CFR  §91.151(a)  falls  within  the  
scope  of  prior  exemptions.  See  Exemption  10673  (allowing  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation  to  
operate  without  compliance  with  FAR  91.151  (a)).  Operating  the  small  UAS,  in  a  tightly  
controlled  area  where  only  people  and  property  owners  or  official  representatives  who  
have  signed  waivers  will  be  allowed,  with  less  than  30  minutes  of  reserve  fuel,  does  not  
engender  the  type  of  risks  that  Section  91.151(a)  was  intended  to  alleviate  given  the  size  
and  speed  of  the  small  UAS.  Additionally,  limiting  sUAS  flights  to  10  minutes  would  greatly  
reduce  the  utility  for  which  the  exemption  will  be  granted.  
  
Applicant  believes  that  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  can  be  achieved  by  limiting  flights  to  30  
minutes  or  25%  of  battery  power  whichever  happens  first.  This  restriction  would  be  more  
than  adequate  to  return  the  sUAS  to  its  planned  landing  zone  from  anywhere  in  its  limited  
operating  area.  
Similar  exemptions  have  been  granted  to  other  operations,  including  Exemptions  2689F,  
5745,  10673,  and  10808.  
  
14  C.F.R.  §91.203  (a)  and  (b):  Carrying  Civil  Aircraft  Certification  and  Registration  
The  regulation  provides  in  pertinent  part:  
  (a)  Except  as  provided  in  §  91.715,  no  person  may  operate  a  civil  aircraft  unless  it  has  
within  it  the  following:  
  (1)  An  appropriate  and  current  airworthiness  certificate.  .  .  .  
(b)  No  person  may  operate  a  civil  aircraft  unless  the  airworthiness  certificate  required  by  
paragraph  (a)  of  this  section  or  a  special  flight  authorization  issued  under  §91.715  is  
displayed  at  the  cabin  or  cockpit  entrance  so  that  it  is  legible  to  passengers  or  crew.  
The  UAS  fully  loaded  weighs  no  more  than  55  lbs  and  is  operated  without  an  onboard  
pilot.As  such,  there  is  no  ability  or  place  to  carry  certification  and  registration  documents  or  
to  display  them  on  the  sUAS.  
An  equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  achieved  by  keeping  these  documents  at  the  ground  
control  point  where  the  pilot  flying  the  sUAS  will  have  immediate  access  to  them,  to  the  
extent  they  are  applicable  to  the  sUAS.The  FAA  has  issued  numerous  exemptions  to  this  
regulation.  A  representative  sample  of  other  exceptions  includes  Exemption  Nos.  9565,  
9665,  9789,  9789A,  9797,  9797A,  9816A,  and  10700.  
  
  
14  C.F.R.  §91.405  (a);  407  (a)  (1);  409  (a)  (2);  417(a)  &  (b):  Maintenance  Inspections  
These  regulations  require  that  an  aircraft  operator  or  owner  "shall  have  that  aircraft  
inspected  as  prescribed  in  subpart  E  of  this  part  and  shall  between  required  inspections,  
except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (c)  of  this  section,  have  discrepancies  repaired  as  
prescribed  in  part  43  of  this  chapter...,"  and  others  shall  inspect  or  maintain  the  aircraft  in  
compliance  with  Part  43.  Given  that  these  section  and  Part  43  apply  only  to  aircraft  with  an  
airworthiness  certificate,  these  sections  will  not  apply  to  the  applicant.  Maintenance  will  be  
accomplished  by  the  operator  pursuant  to  the  flight  manual  and  operating  handbook.  An

equivalent  level  of  safety  will  be  achieved  because  these  small  UASs  are  very  limited  in  size  
and  will  carry  a  small  payload  and  operate  only  in  restricted  areas  for  limited  periods  of  
time.  If  mechanical  issues  arise  the  UAS  can  land  immediately  and  will  be  operating  from  no  
higher  than  400  feet  AGL.The  operator  will  ensure  that  the  UAS  is  in  working  order  prior  to  
initiating  flight,  perform  required  maintenance,  and  keep  a  log  of  any  maintenance  
performed.  Moreover,  the  operator  is  the  person  most  familiar  with  the  aircraft  and  best  
suited  to  maintain  the  aircraft  in  an  airworthy  condition  to  provide  the  equivalent  level  of  
safety.  
  
Pursuant  to  14  C.F.R.  Part  11,  the  following  summary  is  provided  for  publication  in  the  
Federal  Register,  should  it  be  determined  that  publication  is  needed:  
  
Applicant  seeks  an  exemption  from  the  following  rules:  
14  C.F.R.  §21,  subpart  H;  14  C.F.R  45.23(b);14  C.F.R.  §§  61.113(  a)  &  (b);91.7  (a);  91.9  (b)  
(2);91.103(b);91.109;  91.119;  91.121;  91.151(a);91.203(a)  and  (b);  91.405  (a);  91.407  (a)  
(1);  91.409  (a)  (2);  91.409  (a)  (2)  and  91.417  (a)  &  (b)  to  operate  commercially  a  small  
unmanned  vehicle  (55lbs  or  less)  in  aerial  photography  and  cinematography  for  residential  
and  commercial  real  estate  and  closed-set  special  events.  
  
Approval  of  exemptions  allowing  commercial  operations  of  sUASs  for  aerial  photography  
and  cinematography  for  real  estate  and  close-set  special  events  will  enhance  safety  by  
reducing  risk.  Conventional  real  estate  aerial  photography  and  cinematography  use  jet  or  
piston  powered  aircraft  which  carry  large  amounts  of  combustible  fuel  posing  increased  
risk.  Conversely,  sUASs  carry  no  combustible  fuel,  weigh  only  55  lbs.  or  less  comparatively  
to  3,000+  lbs.  of  a  conventional  aircraft,  are  much  more  easily  maneuverable  and  do  not  
ferry  to  and  from  the  production  location.  Additionally,  flying  at  or  below  400  AGL  sUAS  will  
be  no  factor  with  fixed  wing  and  rotor  wing  aircraft.  
  
The  operation  of  small  UASs,  weighting  less  than  55  lbs.,  conducted  in  the  strict  conditions  
outlined  above,  will  provide  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  supporting  the  grant  of  the  
exemptions  requested  herein,  including  exempting  the  applicant  from  the  requirements  of  
Part  21  and  allowing  commercial  operations.  These  lightweight  aircraft  operate  at  slow  
speeds,  close  to  the  ground,  and  in  a  sterile  environment  and,  as  a  result,  are  far  safer  than  
conventional  operations  conducted  with  traditional  aircraft  which  pose  a  safety  risk.  There  
are  no  personnel  on  board  the  sUASs  and  therefore  the  likelihood  of  death  or  serious  bodily  
injury  is  significantly  diminished.  All  flights  will  occur  over  private  or  controlled  access  
property  with  the  property  owner's  prior  consent  and  knowledge.  Filming  will  be  of  people  
who  have  also  consented  to  being  filmed  or  otherwise  have  agreed  to  be  in  the  area  where  
filming  will  take  place.  Aerial  Vision  Chicago  will  provide  an  equivalent  or  better  level  of  
safety  as  that  achieved  under  the  current  FAR's.
