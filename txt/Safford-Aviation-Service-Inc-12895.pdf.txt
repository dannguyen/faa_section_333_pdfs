                                                           Exemption No. 12895
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­2619

Mr. Doug Benson
Safford Aviation Service Inc.
P.O. Box 516
3546 South Hangar Drive
Coolidge, AZ 85128

Dear Mr. Benson:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated June 16, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Safford Aviation Service Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and videography for inspections, mapping, surveying, construction, special
events, and mining.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Inspire 1.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                 2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Safford Aviation Service Inc. is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Safford Aviation Service Inc. is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Inspire 1 when
    weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other
    aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
                                                                                                            4

    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.
                                                                                                            5

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.
                                                                                                            6

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
    Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
    obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.
                                                                                                                 7

 If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
 television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;
           b. Name and phone number of the operator for the UAS aerial filming conducted
              under this grant of exemption;

·D. OVERVIEW

In accordance with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA), Section 333 Special
Rules for Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Safford Aviation seeks an exemption from FAA
regulations restricting COMMERCIAL operation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS).

Safford Aviation specifically requests exemption from the listed FAA Regulations to pe1;tnit
COMMERCIAL operation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) under the conditions ·
outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA.

Safford Aviation also request exemption from such other FARS as the FAA deems appropriate to
enable Safford Aviation's requested operations.

The FAA make any modifications it determines necessary in the granting of this Section 333
Exemption request.

Existing FAA Regulations burden Safford Aviation's sUAS operations by preventing Safford
Aviati.on from. performing commercial sUAS operations to conduct aerial video, photography, and
mappmg semces.

Safford Aviation seeks exemption to permit commercial operations utilizing sUAS to conduct
aerial photography and video for agriculture, construction and mining inspections and surveying,
Federal and State wildland and wildlife mapping, and for special events.

All Safford Aviation sUAS flights will operate in a tightly controlled area, below 400 feet AGL, and
over private or controlled property and with. the permission of the property owner.

Safford Aviation seeks exemption from these FAA Regulations because:
         1) Existing FAA Regulations provide and undue burden upon Safford Aviation's
               commercial sUAS operations.
              a. Safford Aviation operations are briefly described in section C
         2) Equivalent Level of Safety
              a. Operation of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) by Safford Aviation with
                   the sUAS Aircraft, sUAS Flight Crew, sUAS Operating Parameters, sUAS
                   Maintenance and sUAS training requirements as outlined in this request for a Section
                   333 exemption provide an equivalent level of safety
         3) Public interest
              a. Granting these requested exemptions is in the public interest.
              b. For the public interest is described in detail in section K (For the Good of the
                   Public)

The FAA's authority to issue exemptions from current operating rules and regulations, and the
Secretary's authority granted by section 333 ofP.L. 112-95 (Special Rules for Certain Unmanned
Aircraft Systems) provides an opportunity to authorize certain sUAS operations into the National
Airspace System (NAS) prior to implementation of the final sUAS rule. Granting of this exemption
request will permit Safford Aviation to safely arid legally utilize sUAS in the NAS.
                                                                Safford Aviation Service, Inc. I 7

Enclosed are the following documents to support Safford Aviation's Section 333 Exemption
request:

         1) DJI T600 User's Manual
         2) DJI Quadcopter Pilot Training Guide

                                                        ***
Safety is achieved through the relentless pursuit of quality training and adherence to FAA Approved
Operating Procedures and FAA Regulations.

Our approach to the safe operation of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) is three fold:
Operational Procedures (Adherence to FAA Regulations) -Training- Intelligent Aircraft.

                                                        ***

Safford Aviation will operate sUAS weighing less than 55lbs. These intelligent GPS enabled sUAS
have the ability to "auto hover" and "auto return to home" in the event of a loss of RF control
signal.

sUAS aircraft operated by Safford Aviation is discussed in detail in Section F (sUAS Aircraft).
Since aviation is ever changing, amending this document and pending subsequent FAA approval will
provide additional aircraft to be used by Safford Aviation and provide the FAA to approve said
amendment.

                                                        ***

Flight crew for Safford Aviation sUAS operations will be a Flight Operator (Pilot) and a Visual
Observer (VO). The Flight Operator (Pilot) will possess a current FAA private pilot license or
higher and a current FAA Class III medical certificate or United States Drivers License. The Visual
Observer (VO) will have received required Safford Aviation training to qualify for Visual Observer
(VO) duties.

Safford Aviation Flight Crew requirements are discussed in detail in Section G (sUAS Flight Crew).

                                                        ***

Safford Aviation flight operations are to be conducted over private or over controlled access
property, below 400 feet AGL and with the permission of the property owner/controller or
authorized representative.

During Safford Aviation's flight operations the sUAS will always be within visual line of sight
(VLOS) of either the Flight Operator (Pilot) or the Visual Observer (VO). sUAS flight operations
will always be operated in areas that are clear of people, except for personal directly involved with
sUAS operations.

Safford Aviation flight operations are discussed in detail in Section H (sUAS Operating
Parameters).

·E. REGULATION EXEMPTIONS

Listed below are FAA regulations for which Safford Aviation is seeking exemptions.
Safford Aviation also request exemption from such other FARS as the FAA deems appropriate to
enable Safford Aviation's requested operations.

14 CFR § 61.23 (a) (2)

            §61.23 Medical certificates: Requirement and duration.

                         (a) Operations requiring a medical certificate. Except as provided in paragraphs
                         (b) and (c) of this section, a person-

                                   (2) Must hold at least a second class medical certificate when exercising:

                                                 (i) Second-in-command privileges of an airline transport pilot
                                                 certificate in part 121 of this chapter (other than operations
                                                 specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section); or

                                                  (ii) Privileges of a commercial pilot certificate; or

                                     (3) Must hold at least a third-class medical certificate-

                                                  (i) When exercising the privileges of a private pilot certificate;

Exemptions from 14 CFR § 61.23 (a) (2) is sought from the requirement to hold a Second Class Medical
Certificate for commercial flight operations. For sUAS operations, a Third Class Medical Certificate (as
required for Private Pilot Privileges or a valid United States Driver's License) provides an equivalent level
of safety as that of a Second Class Medical Certificate given that:

            1) No persons (crew/passengers) or cargo are carried onboard the sUAS.

            2) The sUAS has the ability to "auto hover" and "auto return to home" at the touch
                         of a button.

            3) In the event of incapacitation of the Flight Operator (Pilot), the sUAS will
                         automatically begin a descent and landing when the battery level falls to below
                         the manufacture's predetermined Critical Low Battery level.

14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b)

§61.113  Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command.

         (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, no person
         who holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in command of an aircraft
         that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire; nor may that
         person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft.

         (b) A private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an
         aircraft in connection with any business or employment if:

         (1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and

         ·(2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation
         or hire.

Exemptions from 14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b) is sought from the requirement for the sUAS Flight
Operator (Pilot) to hold a FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate.

Safford Aviation Flight Operator (Pilot) will hold a FAA Private Pilot Certificate or higher.
                     Safford Aviation Service, Inc. I 9

A FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate requires demonstration of further airmanship skills to safely
catty passengers and cargo for hire. Safford Aviation sUAS will not carry onboard any persons
(passengers/crew) or cargo for hire.

These enhanced airmanship skills are not utilized in flight of the sUAS, thus a Flight Operator (Pilot)
holding a FAA Private Pilot Certificate or higher with sUAS flight training will provide an equivalent
level of safety.

In the granting of exemption, #11062, to Astraeus Aerial the FAA determined that a PIC with a
FAA Private Pilot Certificate operating the sUAS would not adversely affect operations in the NAS
or present a hazard to persons or property on the ground.

In similar fashion to Astraeus Aerial operations, Safford Aviation operations are conducted over private
property or over controlled access property and with the permission of the property owner/controller
or authorized representative.

The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 61.113 (a) and (b)] in
exemption #11062 to Astraeus Aerial.

14 CFR § 91.7 (a)

            §91.7 Civil aircraft airworthiness.

                         (a) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition.

Exemption from 14 CFR § 91.7 (a) is sought requiring Civil Aircraft Airworthiness because:

            1) The sUAS will not receive and Airworthiness Certificate un:der 14 CFR § 21.
            2) Compliance with Safford Aviation Operating Documents will provide a means of

                         insuring an equivalent level of safety.

            3) The Flight Operator (Pilot) of the sUAS has final authority to determine whether
                         the sUAS in a safe condition for flight.

In the granting of exemption #11188 to State Farm the FAA determined that even though the sUAS
is not required to have an airworthiness certificate per 14 CFR § 21 Subpart H, exemption from the
requirements of 14 CFR § 91.7 (a) [Civil Aircraft Airworthiness] is required.

The FAA considers compliance with operating documents to be a sufficient means of determining an
airworthy condition in accordance with the requirements of this part.

Additionally, in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.7 (b), the PIC 1s responsible for determining
whether the aircraft is in a condition for safe flight. The FAA found in the granting of exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company that the PIC can comply with this
requirement.

The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 91.7 (a)] in exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

14 CFR § 91.119 (c)

§91.119   Minimum safe altitudes:

General.

Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below the
following altitudes:

          (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface,
         except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may
         not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.

Exemption from 14 CFR § 91.119 (c) is sought because:

1) All sUAS flights are conducted below 500 feet AGL
                                                              Safford Aviation Service, Inc./10

            2) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over
                        private or controlled property with permission of the property owner.

In the granting of exemption #11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company the FAA
determined that sUAS operations should remain 500 feet from all persons not directly involved
with sUAS operations. The FAA also has determined that operations of closer than 500 feet may be
permitted if:

            1) All non-participating persons are protected by a suitable shelter.
            2) Permission has been granted by the property owner/controller orauthorized

                         representative.
The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 91.119 (c)] in exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

14 CFR § 91.121

            §91. 121 Altimeter settings.

                         (a) Each person operating an aircraft shall maintain the cruising altitude or flight level
                         of that aircraft, as the case may be, by reference to an altimeter that is set, when
                         operating-

                                     (1) Below 18,000 feet MSL,

                                                      to-

                                                (i) The current reported altimeter setting of a station along
                                                  the route and within 100 nautical miles of the aircraft;

                                           Cii) If there is no station within the area prescribed in paragraph

                                                  (a)(1)(I) of this section, the current reported altimeter setting of an
                                                  appropriate available station; or

                                                (iii) In the case of an aircraft not equipped with a radio, the
                                                  elevation ofthe departure airport or an appropriate altimeter setting
                                                  available before departure; or

                                    (2) At or above 18,000 feet MSL, to 29.92" Hg.

                         (b) The lowest usable flight level is determined by the atmospheric pressure in the
                         area of operation as shown in the following table:

                         (c) To convert minimum altitude prescribed under §§91.119 and 91.177 to the
                         minimum flight level, the pilot shall take the flight level equivalent of the minimum
                         altitude in feet and add the appropriate number of feet specified below, according to
                         the current reported altimeter setting:

Exemption from 14 CFR § 121 is sought because:

             1) The sUAS is not equipped with an
                         altimeter.

            2) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet A GLover·
                         private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner.

             3) All sUAS flights are conducted below 400 feet AGL.

                         a. GPS altitude information from the sUAS will be via a data down-link and will
                               be displayed to the Flight Operator (Pilot) in real-time.

            4) This provides an equivalent level of
                         safety.

In the granting of exemption #11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company the
FAA determined that:
                     Safford Aviation Service, Inc. I 11

            1) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over
                        private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner and
                        within VLOS of the Flight Operator (Pilot) or Visual Observer (VO).

            2) The use of onboard GPS altitude information is provided via a data down-link and
                        to the PIC

The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 91.121] in exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

14 CFR § 91.151 (a) and (b)

§91.151  Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions.

         (a) No person may begin a flight in an airplane under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the
         first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed-

                     ( 1) During the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or

                     (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

         (b) No person may begin a flight in a rotorcraft under VFR conditions unless
         (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the
         first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly after that
         for at least 20 minutes.

Exemptions from 14 CFR § 91.151 (a) and (b) is sought
because:

1) Complying with the 30 minute fuel reserve would unnecessarily limit the length of
            the sUAS flights. The DJI T600 has an endurance limit of 18 minutes.

2) All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area below 400 feet AGL over
            private or controlled property and with the permission of the property owner.

3) The DJI T600 sUAS has the enhanced safety feature that it will automatically
            descend and land when the battery level falls to below the manufacture's
            predetermined Critical Low Battery level. Upon landing the DJI T600, motors
            will stop.

4)

            5) The DJI T600 sUAS provides the Flight Operator (Pilot) real-time display of
                        available remaining battery power for flight.

            6) An equivalent level of safety can be achieved .by limiting flights when remaining
                        battery life falls to 25% capacity.

            7) The DJI T600 sUAS operated by Safford Aviation is a rotorcraft (multi- rotor /
                        quad-rotor) unmanned aircraft.

The FAA has previously issued an exemption to this rule [14 CFR § 91.151 (a) (1)] in exemption
#11188 to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.

14 CFR § 91.405 (a)

§91.405  Maintenance required.

Each owner or operator of an aircraft-

         (a) Shall have that aircraft inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and
         shall between required inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this.

         section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter;

Exemption from 14 CFR § 91.405 (a) is sought because:

1) Given that these sections and Part 43 apply to Certificated Aircraft, these
                           Safford Aviation Service, Inc. I 12

                        sections do not apply to the operation of sUAS.

DJI T600 Safety Features:

     1) The DJI T600 has an onboard Intelligent Flight Control System with built-in GPS providing
         accurate position information.

    2) The DJI T600 provides Flight Telemetry Data in real-time to the Flight Operator (Pilot)
         with the following information:
              a. · Display real-time Altitude (AGL),
              b. Display real-time Flight Speed and Distance from the Flight Operator (Pilot).
              c. Display real-time number of GPS satellites in view
              d. Display real-time available remaining battery power for flight.
                         i. Audible and visual alarms alert the operator on the operator display when
                             battery level is reduced.

     3) When the battery level is reduced to "critical low", the DJI T600 will begin an automatic
          descent and landing. Upon landing the DJI T600 motors will stop. The T600 will not crash
         upon inadvertent exhaustion of its power source.

     4) The DJI flight display provides real-time location and heading relative to the Flight Operator
          (Pilot).

     5) The intelligent Flight Control System coupled with the GPS position information onboard
         the DJI T600 provides the ability for the Flight Operator (Pilot) to permit the sUAS to auto-
          hoover in position with compensation for wind and drift.

     6) The intelligent Flight Control System coupled with the GPS position information onboard
          the DJI T600 provides the ability for the Flight Operator (Pilot) to command the sUAS to
          automatically return to its point of departure.

     7) The DJI T600 will return to its point of departure, land and shut down the motors
          automatically in the event of a loss of RF Control from the Flight Operator (Pilot). Loss of
          signal will be displayed on the Flight Operators (Pilot) display.

     8) The DJI T600 is programmed via software to not permit operation above 400 feet AGL.
          This prevents inadvertent flight above the 400 feet AGL ceiling mandated by the FAA.

     9) The DJI T600 is programmed via software to prevent motor start within five nautical miles
          of an airport or in restricted or in prohibited airspace. This prevents inadvertent flight within
          five nautical miles of a restricted airport or otherwise restricted airspace.

     10) These highly advanced capabilities insure that the DJI T600 will not create a hazard to the
          public and can be safely operated in the National Airspace System (NAS) with an equivalent
          level of safety as a certified manned aircraft.

·J. sUAS TRAINING

Safety is achieved through the relentless pursuit of quality training and adherence to FAA Approved
Operating Procedures and FAA Regulations.

This section describes the policies and procedures for training performed by Safford Aviation.
Safford Aviation will use all training sources and methods available to provide employees with the
information necessary for them to perform their assigned duties and tasks correctly and safely.
The majority of the training provided by this organization will use on-the-job (OJT) methodology.

Training Sources

Safford Aviation will use any and all training materials deemed necessary by Safford Aviatron and/or
the FAA to provide training to Safford Aviation Flight Crew members. The following is a list of
materials that will be used to provide training:

         1) FAA Far-AIM
         2) VFR Sectional Chart
         3) Safford Aviation Section 333 Exemption
         4) DJI Quadcopter Pilot Training Guides
         5) DJI T600 Uset's Manual

·K. FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE

Public Interest

Today's current methods of commercial aerial photography and commercial aerial inspection require
the use of a certified manned aircraft or a certified manned helicopter and a pilot with a FAA
Commercial Pilot License. A low flying aircraft or a low altitude helicopter (operating in strict
compliance with existing FAA regulations) hovering and circling over a small confined area creates
an inherent safety risk. It can often create a nuisance of noise pollution in the affected area as well.

The use of a sUAS rather than a manned aircraft in such applications will further the public interest
in several areas including but not limited to the following:

     1) The sUAS carries no passengers, pilot or crew, thereby increasing pilot, passenger and
          worker safety.

     2) The sUAS carries no flammable fuel thereby increasing safety to the public.
     3) The sUAS has a lower noise signature than a typical helicopter thereby improving public

          welfare.
     4) The sUAS has fewer emissions thereby reducing the environment impact over traditional

          manned aircraft.
     5) The sUAS is less expensive to operate than a traditional manned aircraft thereby decreasing

          the cost of imagery. This allows companies the option to inspect more frequently, more
          thoroughly, and thereby increase public welfare.
     6) The sUAS is less expensive to acquire than a manned aircraft thereby allowing more crews to
          operate concurrently.
     7) The sUAS may respond to natural disasters and storm-related damage quicker than manned-
          aircraft.

Privacy

All sUAS flights operate in a tightly controlled area, at altitude of less than 400 feet AGL and over
private or controlled property with permission of the property owner. sUAS operated by Safford
Aviation within the operating parameters outlined herein present no risk to the privacy of the public.

Conclusion

Continued growth and expansion is a vital part of Safford Aviation and our goal to provide a safe
service. Because of this, we are asking for exemption to provide commerdal sUAS services for
aerial photography and video for agriculture, construction and mining inspections and surveying,
wildland and wildlife mapping, and for special events.

As we have provided in this request, sUAS operations for commercial as Safford Aviation service
Inc. has outlined:

         1) Will provide an equivalent level of safety as certified manned aircraft.
         2) Will not adversely affect safety in the National Airspace System
         3) Will reduce airspace congestion.
         4) Will reduce airborne noise.
         5) Will not pose a hazard the public
         6) Will present no risk to the privacy of the public
         7) Will provide an economic benefit to American Citizens.
         8) Is in the interest of the public.

The FAA's authority to issue exemptions from current operating rules and regulations, and the
Secretary's authority granted by section 333 ofP.L. 112-95 (Special Rules for Certain Unmanned
Aircraft Systems) provides an opportunity to authorize certain sUAS operations into the National
Airspace System (NAS) prior to implementation of the final sUAS rule.

Granting this Section 333 exemption request for Safford Aviation Service Inc. for commercial
operation of sUAS within the operating parameters outlined herein IS in the public interest.

Safford Aviation has shown just cause exist for the FAA to grant exemption from these Federal
Aviation Regulations.
