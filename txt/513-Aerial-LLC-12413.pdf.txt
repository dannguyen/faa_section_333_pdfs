                                                           Exemption No. 12413
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­2189

Mr. Zachary P. Elliott, Esq.
Member and In-House Counsel
513 Aerial, LLC
7021 Cleves Warsaw Pike, Suite 301
Cincinnati, OH 45233

Dear Mr. Elliott:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of 513 Aerial, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and videography for the education of real estate professionals and real estate
marketing.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, 513 Aerial, LLC is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                             3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, 513 Aerial, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    not permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.

    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)

FAA Exemption Rulemaking ­ Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11

Prepared by:

Zachary P. Elliott, Esq.
May 21, 2015

U.S. Department of Transportation
Docket Management System
1200 New Jersey Ave., SE
Washington, D.C. 20590

Re: Exemption Request Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations from 14 CFR Part 21; 14 CFR Part 36; 14 CFR 45.23(b); 14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b);
91.7 (a); 91.9 (b) (2); 91.103; 91.105; 91.109; 91.119; 91.121; 91.151 (a); 91.173; 91.203 (a) &
(b); 91.207; and 14 CFR Part 91, Subpart E

Dear Mr. Secretary,

The purpose of this letter is to petition the Federal Aviation Administration for an exemption,
pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act)
and 14 CFR Part 11. 513 Aerial, LLC ("513 Aerial"), an Ohio Limited Liability Company and
operator of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("UAS") equipped to conduct aerial photography
and videography for the education of real estate professionals and real estate marketing purposes,
hereby applies for an exemption from the listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow
commercial operation of its UAS, so long as such operations are conducted within and under the
conditions outlined herein or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333.

As described more fully below, the requested exemption would permit the operation of small,
unmanned and relatively inexpensive UAS under controlled conditions in airspace that is 1)
limited 2) predetermined and 3) controlled as to access. Approval of this exemption would
thereby fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the responsibilities to "...establish requirements
for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system." Section 333(c) of
the FAA Modernization and Reform Act. Additionally, this exemption should be eligible for the
summary grant process, as the FAA has already granted many previous exemptions similar to
this new request.

Identity of Petitioner and Counsel to the Petitioner:

Petitioner:               513 Aerial, LLC
                          c/o Mark Tepe
                          7021 Cleves Warsaw Pike, Suite 301

                          zachary.elliott@me.com
This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing Section
333 (a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This directs the Secretary of Transportation to consider
whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system
("NAS") before completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332 of the Reform Act. In
making this determination, the Secretary is required to determine which types of UAS do not
create a hazard to users of the NAS or the public or pose a threat to national security in light of
the following:

     The UAS's size, weight, speed, and operational capability:
     Operation of the UAS in close proximity to airports and populated areas; and
     Operation of the UAS within Visual Line of Sight ("VLOS") of the Pilot and Visual

         observers. See Reform Act §333(a). Lastly, if the Secretary determines that such vehicles
         "may operate safely in the NAS, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe
         operation of such aircraft in the national airspace system." Id. §333(c). The Federal
         Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA the authority to issue exemptions. This statutory
         authority by its terms includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under
         §40101 of the Act; that includes UAS, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must
         have a current airworthiness certificate. The Administrator may grant an exemption from
         a requirement of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any
         sections 44702-44716 of this title if the Administrator finds the exemption in the public
         interest. 49 U.S.C. §44704; 14 CFR §91.203(a)(1).
     513 Aerial's UAS are small rotorcraft aircraft, specifically a DJI Phantom 2, weighing no
         more than 55oz including sensor payload. They operate their rotorcraft, under normal
         conditions at a speed of no more than 20 mph, usually 5-8 mph, and have the capability
         to hover, and move in the vertical and horizontal plane simultaneously. They will
         manually operate only in VLOS and will operate only within the operating parameters as
         described in the User Manual v1.4 attached as Exhibit A to this Petition.
     Adherence to the User Manual will insure that the UAS will "not create a hazard to the
         national airspace system or the public."
     Given the small size and weight of the UAS involved and the restricted sterile
         environment within which they will operate, the Petitioner falls within that zone of safety
         (an equivalent level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by
         exemption, allow commercial operations of the UAS to commence immediately. Also
         due to the size of the UAS and the areas in which the relevant UAS will operate, approval
         of the application presents no national security issue. Given the clear direction in Section
         333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained in the Federal Aviation Act, as amended;
         the strong equivalent level of safety, surrounding the proposed operations, and significant
         public benefit, including enhanced safety, reduction in environmental impact, including
         reduced emissions associated with allowing UAS for educational and marketing
         operations, (as opposed to full scale aircraft), the granting of the requested exemptions
         are in the public interest. Accordingly, the Petitioner respectfully requests that the FAA
         grant the requested exemption without delay.

Granting this Exemption is in the Public Interest

         An exemption of the following FAR's for 513 Aerial is in the public interest because the
services 513 will be providing to local real estate owners, brokers, agents and commercial
contractors will allow for these parties to provide better and more cost effective services to their
clients. If this exemption is not granted, 513 Aerial will be unable to provide such services to the
public and this will reduce the number of options everyone has to receive accurate and affordable
aerial photographs and video of real estate.

UAS Equivalent Level of Safety & Operating Parameters

The Petitioner proposes that the exemption requested apply to civil aircraft that have the
characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed in this Petition. These limitations
provide for at least an equivalent or possibly higher level of safety to operations under the
current regulator structure because the proposed operations represent a safety enhancement to the
already safe filming operations conducted with conventional aircraft. These limitations and
condition to which 513 Aerial agrees to be bound when conducting commercial operations under
an FAA issued exemption include:

    1. 513 Aerial will be operating a DJI Phantom 2.
    2. All UAS will weigh less than 5 lbs.
    3. Flights will be operated manually within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the Pilot and

         Visual observer.
    4. 513 Aerial will establish a fixed location where the portable ground station of the UAS

         will be positioned and will post a sign near the ground stations stating "Aerial
         Photography in Progress ­ Remain Back 150 feet."
    5. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 25 minutes. Flights will be
         terminated at 25% battery power reserve should that occur prior to the 25 minute limit.
    6. Flights will be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet AGL, though typical
         operations will be conducted within 50 feet of the ground.
    7. Minimum two (2) man crew for each UAS operation will consist of the Pilot and Visual
         observer. The UAS Pilot in Command (PIC) will be an FAA licensed airman with at least
         a private pilot's certificate and third class medical.
    8. The UAS will only operate within the limitations as defined in the User Manual in
         section 6.1. Additionally, the UAS will only operate under 400ft AGL, and outside a 3
         statute mile radius of any airport. The UAS will never enter any MOA or Restricted
         Airspace, nor shall it violate any TFR as outlined by the FAA.
    9. A pre-flight briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned UAS operation prior to
         each day's flying /recording activities. It will be mandatory that all personnel who will be
         performing duties as "flight crew" be present for this briefing.
    10. The Operator will obtain the consent of all persons involved in the filming and ensure
         that only consenting persons will be allowed within 100 feet of the flight operation, and
         this radius may be reduced to 30 feet based upon an equivalent level of safety
         determination.
    11. Pilot, and Visual observer will have been trained in operation of UAS generally and
         received up-to-date information on the particular UAS to be operated as required.
    12. The visual observer and Pilot will at all times be able to communicate by voice or two-
         way radio.
    13. Written permission from the relevant property owners will be obtained.
    14. Prior to the start of a flight, the PIC will activate and use the UAS GPS flight safety
    procedure and lost-link procedure to ensure that the UAS is returned to a pre-determined
    home base in the event of a lost signal or compromised communication.
15. The UAS will have the capability to abort a flight in case of unpredicted obstacles or
    emergencies.

16. In the event that any flight would ever occur within the airspace of a specific airport, or
    controlled airspace, 513 Aerial will obtain the permission of that control tower to operate
    in that airspace or from the appropriate control authority.

17. In the event that any flight will occur within five (5) miles of an airport, 513 Aerial will

    ensure that the airport is notified of the estimated flight time, flight duration, elevation of
    flight, and pertinent information.
18. 513 Aerial will conduct all flights in permissible weather, and during daylight hours.

14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates

Part 21 establishes the procedures for issuance of certificates of airworthiness, as mandated by
49 U.S.C. § 44704 and as required by FAR §91.203 (a)(1). Given the size and limited operating
area associated with the UAS to be utilized by the Petitioner, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart
H meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the
Reform Act. The Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. §44701(f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act
both authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement capability, and proximity to
airports and populated areas of the particular UAS.
The Petitioner requests an exemption from the requirements of this Part because the size, weight,
speed, operational capability and proximity to airports in which the Subject UAS pose
significantly less of a risk that the risks posed by conventional aircraft. Manned aircraft pose
risks to the life and safety of the crew; that is not a consideration with a UAS. Risks to third
parties are also minimized given the lightweight and slow speed at which a UAS would operate.
Nor are there risks of fuel spillage or fire in the event of an accident. Thus, 513 Aerial requests
that the FAA waive the requirement that the Subject UAS, particularly the aircraft portion,
require an airworthiness certificate.

The UAS to be operated by 513 Aerial is less than 5 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a pilot nor
passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exclusively
within a limited radius area as set out in the pre-flight briefing / VLOS operations. Unlike other
civil aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and monitored by both
the Operator, pursuant to safety requirements, and under the requirements and in compliance
with local public safety requirements, to provide security for the area of operation as is now done
with conventional aircraft. These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft
operated in connection with video production, provide a greater degree of safety to the public
and property owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates
issued under 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria
demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security posed by the UAS, due to its size,
speed of operation, location of operation, lack of explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels,
and inability to carry a substantial external load.

14 CFR Part 36: Noise Standards

FAR Part 36, Subparts A, F and O, establish certain noise standards for certification of various
aircraft types. Because the UAS would not have an airworthiness certificate, and given its small
size and negligible noise impact, the petitioner requests an exemption from FAR Part 36.

14 CFR §45.23 (B): Marking of the Aircraft

The regulation requires:

When marks include only the Roman capital letter "N" and the registration number is displayed
on limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental or provisionally certificated
aircraft, the operator must also display on that aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or
pilot station, in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 6 inches high, the words "limited,"
"restricted", "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," as applicable.

Even though the UAS will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be needed as the
UAS will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the word
"Experimental" can be placed. Given the size of the UAS, two-inch lettering will be impossible.
The word "Experimental" will be placed on the fuselage in compliance with §45.29 (f).

The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the UAS marked on its fuselage as
required by §45.29 (f) where the Pilot, Visual Observer and others working with the UAS will
see the identification of the UAS as "Experimental." The FAA has issued the following
exemptions to this regulation to Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167, 10167A and 11438.

14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and
Limitations - Pilot in Command (PIC)

Sections 61.113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to noncommercial operations. Because the UAS
will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve the equivalent level of
safety of current operations by requiring the PIC operating the aircraft to have a private pilot's
license rather than a commercial pilot's license to operate this small UAS. Unlike a conventional
aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the UAS is remotely controlled with no living thing
on board. The area of operation is controlled and restricted, and all flights are planned and
coordinated in advance as set forth in the Operating Manual. The level of safety provided by the
requirements included in the Operating Manual meets that provided by a single individual
holding a commercial pilot's certificate operating a conventional aircraft. The risks associated
with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that allowing operations of
the UAS as requested with a private pilot as the PIC exceeds the present level of safety achieved
by 14 CFR §61.113 (a) & (b).

The Petitioner requests an exemption that would allow 513 Aerial to operate the UAS for
compensation or hire for the reasons articulated in In re Trudeau, FAA Exemption No. 11138,
and In re Astraeus, FAA Exemption No. 11062. 513 Aerial will operate the UAS over property
where the owner and/or owner's representative has requested that the operation occur.
Furthermore, as a holder of a private pilot certificate, the PIC will be an Airman who meets the
knowledge base and skill level for operating an UAS. 513 Aerial thus requests an exemption
from the requirement that the PIC of the UAS hold a commercial pilot certificate and anything
other than a Third Class Medical certificate.

14 CFR §91.7 (a): Civil Aircraft Airworthiness

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining airworthiness.
Given the size of the aircraft and the requirements contained in the Operating Manual for
maintenance and use of safety checks prior to each flight, as set forth in the Operating Manual,
an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

To the extent that "airworthy" is defined as requiring an airworthiness certificate, the Petitioner
would request an exemption from this FAR for the same reasons identified in its request for an
exemption of 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H. 513 Aerial and the PIC will not, however, operate the
Subject UAS if it is not in a condition for safe flight, as required under FAR 91.7(b).

14 CFR §91.9 (b) (2): Civil Aircraft Flight Manual in the
Aircraft

Section 91.9 (b) (2) provides: No person may operate a U.S.-registered civil aircraft--

         (2) For which an Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of
         this chapter, unless there is available in the aircraft a current approved Airplane or
         Rotorcraft Flight Manual, approved manual material, markings, and placards, or
         any combination thereof.

The UAS, given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight manual on
the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is no room or capacity
to carry such an item on the aircraft.

The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the Operating Manual at the ground
control point where the pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to it. The FAA has
issued the following exemptions to this regulation: Exemption Nos. 8607, 8737, 8738, 9299,
9299A, 9565, 9565B, 10167, 10167A 10602, 32827, 10700 and 11434.

Petitioner requests exemption from the requirement of FAR 91.9, for the same reasons as stated
in its request for exemption under 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H, and for a deviation from the
marking requirements of 14 CFR Part 36, Subparts A, F, and O.

14 CFR §91.103: Preflight Action

This regulation requires each pilot in command to take certain actions before flight to insure the
safety of flight. As FAA approved rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided for the aircraft
an exemption will be needed. An equivalent level of safety will be provided as set forth in the
Operating Manual. The PIC will take all actions including reviewing weather, flight battery
requirements, landing and takeoff distances and aircraft performance data before initiation of
flight but requests an exemption from this requirement insofar as it is interpreted as requiring
pre-flight actions appropriate to manned aircraft only (e.g., that flights be from an airport, etc.).

14 CFR § 91.105: Flight crewmembers at stations

Section 91.105 mandates that crewmembers be at designated stations, have safety belts fastened,
etc. Petitioner would be at a designated ground station for each mission, but requests an
exemption to accommodate the fact that the UAS is unmanned.

14 CFR §91.109: Flight Instruction

Section 91.109 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned free balloon)
that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls.
UAS and remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual controls.
Flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the
aircraft via radio communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training without
fully functional dual controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in experimental
aircraft. See Exemption Nos. 5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of safety provided by the
fact that aircraft will be piloted by a certified private pilot who has previously trained in remote
flight areas before attempting flight within filming distance of structures.

14 CFR §91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119 (d) allows
helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person operating
the helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the FAA. As this
exemption is for a UAS, 513 Aerial requests authority to operate at altitudes up to 400 ft. AGL;
an exemption may be needed to allow such operations. As set forth herein, the UAS will never
operate at higher than 400 ft. AGL. It will however be operated in a controlled area where
buildings and people will not be exposed to operations without their pre-obtained consent.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, and speed of the UAS as
well as location where it is operated. No flight will be taken without the permission of the
property owner. Because of the advance notice to the property owner and participants in the
photographic activity, all affected individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations as
set forth in the Operating Manual. Compared to flight operations with aircraft or rotorcraft
weighing far more than the maximum 5 lbs. proposed herein and the lack of flammable fuel, any
risk associated with these operations is far less than those presently presented with conventional
aircraft operating at or below 500 ft. AGL. In addition, the low-altitude operations of the UAS
will ensure separation between these small UAS operations and the operations of conventional
aircraft that must comply with Section 91.119.

14 CFR §91.121: Altimeter Settings

This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an appropriate
altimeter setting available before departure." As the UAS will not have a barometric altimeter,
but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety
will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the Operating Manual, confirming the altitude of
the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR §91.151 (a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR
Conditions

Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an individual from beginning "a flight in an airplane under VFR
conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly
to the first point of intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed ­ (1) During the day,
to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) At night, to fly after that for at least 45 minutes."
The battery powering the UAS provides approximately 25 minutes of powered flight. To meet
the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR §91.151, UAS flights would not be possible. Given
the limitations on the UAS's proposed flight area and the location of its proposed operations
within a predetermined area, a longer time frame for flight in daylight or night VFR conditions is
reasonable.

Petitioner believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 25
minutes or 25% of battery power, whichever should occur first. This restriction would be more
than adequate return the UAS to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its limited operating
area. Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689F,
5745, 10673, 10808 and 11434.

19 CFR § 91.173: ATC clearance and flight plan in IFR
conditions

Petitioner requests an exemption from the IFR-clearance requirement for flights into controlled
airspace. It is possible that 513 Aerial may operate the UAS in conditions that are IFR within
controlled airspace. It would request that, after contacting ATC for the controlled airspace, it
would be allowed to operate in what might be IFR conditions, but where the PIC still has a
complete and unfettered line of sight visibility with the UAS.

14 CFR §91.203 (a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft
Certification and Registration

The regulation provides in pertinent part:

(a) Except as provided in §91.715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within it
the following:

(1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

(b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
paragraph (b) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is displayed at
the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

The UAS fully loaded weighs no more than 5 lbs. and is operated without an onboard Pilot. As
such, there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or to display
them on the UAS.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground control
point where the Pilot flying the UAS will have immediate access to them, to the extent they are
applicable to the UAS, and should they be issued. The FAA has issued numerous exemptions to
this regulation. A representative sample of other exceptions includes Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665,
9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

14 CFR § 91.207: Emergency Locator Transmitter

Section 91.207 prohibits operation of a US-registered aircraft unless it is equipped with an
emergency locator transmitter. Given the limited distance of flights of the UAS, 513 Aerial
requests and exemption from this FAR.

14 CFR Part 91, Subpart E: Maintenance Inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required inspections, except as provided in
paragraph C of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in Part 43 of this
chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43. Given
that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, these
sections will not apply to the Petitioner.

Maintenance will be accomplished by the operator; pursuant to the Operating manual. An
equivalent level of safety will be achieved because these small UAS are very limited in size and
will carry a small payload and operate only in restricted areas for limited periods of time. If
mechanical issues arise the UAS can land immediately and will be operating from no higher than
400 ft. AGL. As provided in the Operating Manual, the PIC (operator) will ensure that the UAS
is in working order prior to initiating flight, and perform required maintenance. Moreover, the
operator is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the aircraft in an
airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the Federal
Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:

Petitioner seeks an exemption from the following rules:

Petition for Exemption.

Federal Aviation Regulations from which Petitioner seeks exemption: 14 CFR 14 CFR Part 21,
Subpart H; Part 36; § 45.23; Part 61; §§ 91. 7; 91.9; 91.103; 91.105; 91.109; 91.119; 91.121;
91.151; 91.173; 91.203; 91.207; and 14 CFR Part 91, Subpart E.

Description of Relief Sought: The Petitioner is seeking an exemption from the above-referenced
Federal Aviation Regulations to conduct aerial photography using a light, unmanned aerial vehicle
for homeowners, real estate brokers and other real estate professionals seeking to provide aerial
images of real estate.

Privacy

All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's prior
consent and knowledge, or over remote public land. Image capture of people will rarely take
place, but in the event they are, any person whose image is captured will have consented prior to
being filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where data collection will take place.

Summary

Satisfaction of the criteria provided in Section 333 of the Reform Act of 2012 ­ size, weight,
speed, operating capabilities, proximity to airports and populated areas and operation within
visual line of sight and national security ­ provide more than adequate justification for the grant
of the requested exemptions allowing commercial operation of Petitioner's UAS in the real estate
industry pursuant to the User Manual attached as Exhibit A.

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards

and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller

contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.

The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both

attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)

to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is

used to communicate with the remote controller and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control

system connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom 2 mode.

This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for more

information.

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G Wi-Fi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
          updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
          while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote controller's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range

during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Controller Operation

  The operations of remote controller are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote controller are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote controller is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

(Mode 2)                                  The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation.
                                          Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                          Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                          The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                                          altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                          Push the throttle stick above the centered (mid-point)
                                          position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we
                                          suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to
                                          prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected
                                          elevation changes.

                                                      The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter
                                                      clock-wise.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate
                                                      clock-wise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will
                                                      remain facing the same direction.
                                                      The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of
                                                      the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center
                                                      results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity.
                                                      The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt.
                                                      Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      forward.
                                                      Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly
                                                      backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the
                                                      stick is centered.
                                                      Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center
                                                      will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and
                                                      faster flight velocity.
                                                      The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt.
                                                      Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left.
                                                      Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right.
                                                      The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is
                                                      centered.
                                                      Pushing the stick further away from center will result in
                                                      a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight
                                                      velocity.

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

                                                         Flip once

5.3 When Recalibration is required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment (No base

                   stations or cell towers around).

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The same CSC is used to
stop the motors.

A                                         BC          D

                                          Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote controller.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Controller Operation>

      for more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The stick will lock into

©2013-2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 |
      place and the aircraft will descend steadily.
  7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return throttle stick to

      middle position after the motors have stopped.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.
          4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density and

                   temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as
                   battery and aircraft performance may be reduced.
          5 When used with a H3-3D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 will be very
                   close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2
                   propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote controller is lost. The flight control
system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote controller and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote controller is powered off.
2 The remote controller is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must

        have been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote controller.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote controller and the aircraft, essentially

        reducing the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote controller.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

©2013-2015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 |
Home Point

When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as

the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being

able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

Go Home Procedures                         2 Flying.                                         3 Remote controller signal lost.

          1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
                   will descend automatically.

          2 When the aircraft is landing automatically, users can control the aircraft's position and altitude if
                   the remote controller signal is recovered.

          In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
          as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
          controller from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position
          as a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks
          on the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:

          1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is
                   recorded last time.

          2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

               distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote controller's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled by
                      ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own rules,
                      make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the
                      PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.
