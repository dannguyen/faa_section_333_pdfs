                                                      Exemption No. 11311A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-1055

Counsel for Next Generation Aviation Services, L.L.C.

Dear Mr. Pucciarelli:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated April 23, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Next Generation (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment to your
current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a),
61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and
(2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the
petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection. You requested an amendment
to add the DJI Inspire 1 T600.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                  2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11311
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11311 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI S1000+ and
         DJI Inspire 1 T600 when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
         operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
         exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

            Re: Amendment to Exemption No. 11311 issued pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA
                     Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations in Regulatory Docket
                     No. FAA-2014-1055

            Dear Sirs/Madams:

                     Next Generation was issued Exemption number 11311 (hereinafter the "Exemption")
            using the DJI S 1000+ Premium Unmanned Aircraft System. At this time, Next Generation
            respectfully requests that the Exemption be amended to permit its use of an additional unmanned
            aircraft system ("UAS") platform, specifically, the DJI Inspire 1 model T600 quadcopter. The
            DJI Inspire 1 model T600 falls within all the operating limitations in our approved Exemption
            and therefore Next Generation will also be using the same Operations and Safety Manual
            submitted as confidential documents under the original approved Exemption.

                     Attached hereto and submitted as a confidential document is the Inspire 1 User Manual
            that will be used in conjunction with Next Generation's Operations and Safety Manual to
            maintain full compliance with the terms of the Exemption.

                     As this is an amendment to an existing-exemption, it is Next Generation's position that
            good cause for the amendment exists and that notice of the requested amendment does not have
            to be published in the Federal Register. All operations of the additional UAS will be in full
            compliance with the terms of the Exemption.
