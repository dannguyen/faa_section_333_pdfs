                                                      Exemption No. 11241A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0692

Counsel for Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC

Dear Mssrs. McKinnon and Clark:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition to amend Exemption No.
11241. It explains the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the
original conditions and limitations.

By letters dated April 2 and April 16, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC (hereinafter petitioner
or operator) for an amendment to Exemption No. 11241. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a)
and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1),
91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection. You requested an amendment to add additional aircraft, the Pulse Aerospace
Vapor 55 UAS, and to expand operations to closed-set motion picture and television filming
and production.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.
                                                                                                                  2

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11241
remains valid with respect to this exemption and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the
authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the
Administrator, Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC is granted an amendment to its exemption
that expands operations to closed-set motion picture and television filming and productions,
and adds new aircraft: Pulse Aerospace Vapor 55 UAS.

The operator shall add this amendment to the original Exemption No. 11241.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11241 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition no. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft and Condition
no. 2 has been updated to reflect closed-set motion picture and television filming and
productions.

In this grant of exemption, Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC is hereafter referred to as
the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Pulse Vapor 35,
         Vulcan Octo, and the Pulse Aerospace Vapor 55 UAS when weighing less than
         55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a
         new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         permitted.
                                                                                                                  3

This exemption terminates on March 31, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.
Sincerely,

John S. Duncan

        Re: Amendment to Exemption No. 11241 Issued to Phoenix Air
                UNMANNED, LLC Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act
                (Docket No. FAA-2014-0692)

Dear Gentlemen:

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC ("Phoenix Air UNMANNED") was issued Exemption
No. 11241 on March 26, 2015 (hereinafter "the Exemption"), allowing operation of the Pulse
Vapor 35 and Vulcan Octo UASs for filmmaking, precision aerial surveys and infrastructure
inspections. Phoenix Air UNMANNED hereby requests an amendment to the Exemption to add
an additional model of UAS that fully complies with the conditions of the Exemption.

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED seeks to operate the Pulse Aerospace Vapor 55 UAS under
the same conditions and limitations contained in the Exemption. Phoenix Air UNMANNED will
submit the Pulse Aerospace Vapor 55 Aircraft Flight Manual and a revised version of the
Phoenix Air UNMANNED UAS Operations Manual that includes the Vapor 55. These manuals
are submitted as confidential documents pursuant to 14 C.F.R. § 11.35(b), as the materials
contain confidential commercial and/or proprietary information that Phoenix Air UNMANNED
has not and will not share with others. Additionally, these documents contain operating
conditions and procedures that are not generally available to the public and are protected from
release under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq. All operations of the
additional UAS will be in full compliance with the terms of the Exemption.

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED believes that an amendment adding the Vapor 55 to the
Exemption is in the public's interest as it would reduce hazards and emissions associated with
U.S. Department of Transportation

alternate use of helicopters to conduct similar inspection operations. Like the other UAS models
authorized for use under the Exemption, the Vapor 55 is light weight and does not carry any
flammable fuel, further reducing the risk from any potential accident. In addition, the Vapor 55
is equipped with state of the art safety features, such as a "return to home" capability and an
encrypted digital link to ensure safe operations.

         As this is an amendment to an existing exemption seeking the addition of supplementary
UAS model, Phoenix Air UNMANNED respectfully submits that good cause exists so that
notice does not need to be published in the Federal Register for the requested amendment.

         If you have any questions, or need any additional information to process the requested
amendment to the Exemption, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.

                                                               Very truly yours,

        Re: Second Amendment to Exemption No. 11241 Issued to Phoenix Air
                UNMANNED, LLC Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act
                (Docket No. FAA-2014-0692)

Dear Gentlemen:

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC ("Phoenix Air UNMANNED") was issued Exemption No.
11241 on March 26, 2015 (hereinafter "the Exemption"), allowing commercial operation of the Pulse
Vapor 35 and Vulcan Octo UASs for aerial data collection and filming. On March 31, 2015,
Phoenix Air UNMANNED filed a petition to amend the Exemption to allow operation of the Pulse
Aerospace Vapor 55 UAS under the same conditions and limitations contained in the Exemption.
That petition to amend the Exemption remains pending.

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED hereby requests a second amendment to the Exemption to allow
UAS operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming. Specifically,
Phoenix Air UNMANNED seeks revision to conditions and limitations number 2 of the Exemption
to state:

         "2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming
         are permitted."

In all other respects, the closed-set motion picture and television filming will be conducted in
accordance with the same conditions and limitation contained in the Exemption.

         As required by conditions and limitations number 29 of the Exemption, the Petitioner is
filing under separate cover the Phoenix Air UNMANNED, LLC Movie Production and Television
U.S. Department of Transportation

Operations Manual ("MPTOM"). The MPTOM is submitted as a confidential document pursuant to
14 C.F.R. § 11.35(b), as the materials contain confidential commercial and/or proprietary
information that Phoenix Air UNMANNED has not and will not share with others. Additionally,
these documents contain operating conditions and procedures that are not generally available to the
public and are protected from release under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq.

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED believes that an amendment allowing UAS operations for the
purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming is in the public's interest as it would
reduce hazards and emissions associated with alternate use of helicopters to conduct similar closed-
set filming operations. Petitioner's UASs are light weight and do not carry any flammable fuel,
further reducing the risk from any potential accident.

         Phoenix Air UNMANNED respectfully submits that this amendment qualifies for summary
grant approval. The FAA has already granted previous exemptions similar to this amendment
request, namely; small UAS operations for film/television production. See e.g., Grant of Exemption
to Ryan K. Koffman, Exemption No. 11314. Given that the proposed operations will fully comply
with the other conditions of the Exemption, there is no need for the FAA to repeat the analysis
performed for the original exemption on which this amendment is based. For these same reasons,
good cause exists so that notice does not need to be published in the Federal Register for the
requested amendment.

         If you have any questions, or need any additional information to process the requested
amendment to allow UAS operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television
filming, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.

                                                               Very truly yours,
