                                                           Exemption No. 12810
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-2346

Mr. Jorge Sosa
JOSA Industries, LLC
163 Rue du Belier, Apartment 104
Lafayette, LA 70506

Dear Mr. Sosa:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated May 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of JOSA Industries, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and aerial inspection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
                                                                                            2

finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, JOSA Industries, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, JOSA Industries, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating

          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be

JOSA Industries, LLC operates unmanned aerial systems that are multi-rotorcraft equipped with
precision flight and stable hovering, radar positioning, return home, onscreen real-time flight
parameters, on-board NAZA computer stabilization controller and GPS, the UAS will weigh less
than 55 lbs. or less and most typically include camera/payload. Normal UAS operations are
conducted at speeds well below 100 KIAS utilizing the functions of rotorcraft; it has the ability to

hover. JOSA Industries, LLC will only operate in line of sight and will operate in airspace described
in this document or as specified by the FAA. All UAS operations will be vetted by JOSA Industries,
LLC operator/ qualified personnel to confirm that there are no hazards to users of the National
Airspace System or innocent bystanders or general public.

E. How the request benefits the public as a whole
JOSA Industries, LLC believes that the safe, limited, and controlled operations of its unmanned
aerial systems (UAS) described in this document will meet and exceed the strict safety and
security standards of the FAA and/or national security issues. Moreover, JOSA Industries, LLC
believes that the utilization of UAS described in this document will benefit the public as a whole in
five ways;
1) JOSA Industries, LLC continued commitment to keep the highest level of safety during its UAS
operations and set industry standards for safe UAS operations for future operators

2) Reduce the risk to life and property

3) Reducing National Airspace System (NAS) congestion through utilization of small (less than
55lbs.) UAS instead of conventional aircraft during aerial photography/ inspection operations.

4) Reducing noise and air pollution created by conventional fixed wing/rotor wing aircraft, and

5) Increase aerial photography/inspection industry economic growth.

JOSA Industries, LLC utilization of UAS (DJI Phantom 2 Vision +) for the purposes of aerial
photography/ inspection will be a leader in using and setting industry best practices for safe UAS
operations in the NAS. Additionally, utilization of UAS will reduce the risk to life and property by
limiting the use of conventional aircraft such as fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft with weights in
excess of 1000lbs and carrying hundreds of gallons of flammable fuels flying at low altitudes. The

UAS described in this document is less than 55 lbs. carries a small battery as a power source and

can effectively do the same job as conventional aircraft with reduced likelihood and severity of risk.
Moreover, the utilization of UAS will reduce UAS congestion by reduced usage of conventional
aircraft requiring access to UAS. An additional benefit will be reductions in noise and air pollution
from conventional aircraft by utilization of small UAS using batteries as the main source of power
instead of fossil fuels used by conventional aircraft. Finally, the utilization of UAS for aerial

photography/ inspection will allow for positive economic growth in the aerial photography/
inspection industry, as well as peripheral industries that rely on aerial photography/ inspection, i.e.,
building construction, real estate, and inspection services.

G. Specific Sections of 14 CFR from which JOSA Industries, LLC Seeks Exemption
14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b): Private Pilot Privileges and Limitations: Pilot in Command.

The proposed UAS operations by JOSA Industries, LLC would employ All UAS Pilot in Commands
(PICs) to go through a JOSA Industries, LLC ground school and flight lessons in accordance with
manufactures and industry guidance prior to operations. All JOSA Industries, LLC PIC's will only

operate the UAS as stated in this document and/or as recommended by the FAA. All JOSA Industries,
LLC UAS operations will be controlled and limited, all flights will be coordinated ahead of time. JOSA
Industries, LLC feels that the level of safety will be equivalent or in excess that of a commercial pilot
operations. JOSA Industries, LLC objective is to safety operate UAS in a controlled manner at a
reduced risk level that would not require a commercial pilot certificate.

14 C.F.R. §91.7(a): Civil aircraft airworthiness.

JOSA Industries, LLC would like to request and exemption to operate their UAS without an

airworthiness certificate. Instead, JOSA Industries, LLC will verify the airworthiness of the UAS prior to
each flight to ensure that the UAS is airworthy prior to each and every flight. All record keeping of
maintenance actions will be documented in the same manner as a conventional aircraft. In order to

meet or exceed level of safety as described in 14 C.F.R. §91.7(a). JOSA Industries, LLC operations
will include:
Pre-flight operations prior to each flight the PIC will conduct and preflight inspection of the UAS and
Ground Control Station to ensure it's in a condition for safe flight. All discrepancies found during the
preflight inspection will prohibit flight operations until the necessary maintenance has been performed
and the UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight. All discrepancies, maintenance, alterations will
be properly documented in the aircraft records.
If the UAS has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation or flight
characteristics there will be a functional flight test by the PIC and the PIC will make and entry in the

14 C.F.R. §91.119 (c): Minimum safe altitudes

JOSA Industries, LLC would like to request an exemption to 91.119 paragraph (c) Over other than
congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely
populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person,
vessel, vehicle, or structure.
All flights will be conducted with within visual line of sight and with prior permission from the owner
of the property or local municipality. Additionally, all persons, vessels, vehicles, not directly
involved with the operation will be notified and cleared of the area where the proposed UAS

operations will be conducted. The advance notice and access restricted area will maintain an
equivalent level of safety of that described in 14 C.F.R. §91.119 (c): Minimum safe altitudes.

14 C.F.R. §91.121 Altimeter Settings

JOSA Industries, LLC is requesting an exemption from 14 CFR 91.121 requiring each person

operating an aircraft shall maintain the cruising altitude by reference to an altimeter that is se when
operating below 18,000 feet mean sea level to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure.
To meet the equivalent level of safety, the UAS operated by JOSA Industries, LLC has GPS
altitude readout instead of a barometric altimeter. The JOSA Industries, LLC qualified PIC will
maintain the equivalent level of safety by confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the

GPS altitude indicator prior to each flight. The operating documents will require confirmation of the
launching site altitude on the UAS GPS altitude indicator before each flight.

14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a): Fuel Requirements for Flight in VFR Conditions
JOSA Industries, LLC believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by following the
UAS manufacturer's operating documents with regard to battery voltage. In order to achieve or
exceed the level of safety, the JOSA Industries, LLC PIC will not begin a flight unless (considering
wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough power to fly to the intended landing point at
normal cruising speed and land the UAS with no less than 30% of battery power.

14 C.F.R. §91.405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417(a) & (b): Maintenance Inspections

JOSA Industries, LLC UAS operations will keep an equivalent level of safety as described below.
