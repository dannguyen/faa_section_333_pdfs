                                                           Exemption No. 11634
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­0571

Mr. Chris Tonn
Owner
Pelican Drones, LLC
55 South A Street
Suite 110
Pensacola, FL 32502

Dear Mr. Tonn:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter posted to the docket March 9, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on behalf of Pelican Drones, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator)
for an exemption. The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft
system (UAS) to conduct aerial photography and video primarily of real property.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a Phantom Vision 2 Plus.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
                                                                                                                 2

provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Pelican Drones, LLC is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Pelican Drones, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.
                                                                                                                 3

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Phantom Vision 2
         Plus when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of
         any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
         Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
         documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
         operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
         documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
                                                                                                            4

    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    Government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
                                                                                                            5

    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least 5 minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.
                                                                                                               6

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.

   29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
       as documented in this grant of exemption.
                                                                                                                 7

    30. At least 3 days before aerial filming, the operator of the UAS affected by this
         exemption must submit a written Plan of Activities to the local Flight Standards
         District Office (FSDO) with jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming. The 3-day
         notification may be waived with the concurrence of the FSDO. The plan of activities
         must include at least the following:
           a. Dates and times for all flights;

Exemption Request under Section 333 of the FAA Reform Act and Part 11 of the Federal 

Aviation Regulations  

 

Dear Sir or Madam:  

 

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the "Reform Act") 

and 14 C.F.R. Part 11, Pelican Drones, LLC (PD) seeks an exemption from Federal Aviation 

Regulations ("FARs") detailed below for the following described Unmanned Aerial System 

called in this application the PD System, which includes an Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and 

ground stationbased equipment and crew:  

 

THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT (UA):   

    A lightweight (2.7 lb gross weight with all onboard equipment), battery operated 

   4motor rotorcraft in the form of a octocopter that takes off and lands vertically, 

   manufactured by DJI, Model Phantom Vision Plus 2, to carry the following equipment 

   in flight   

    An onboard flight computer with GPS navigation and location ability that receives 

   signals for flight controls from a groundbased transmitter/controller   

    An onboard camera capable of capturing imagery in the form of full color, high 

   definition still photos and video   

    An onboard telemetry system that delivers flight data from the onboard flight 

   computer to the onboard radio transmitter including altitude AGL, horizontal and 

   vertical speed, compass direction of flight and direction back to its launch site   

    A 600mW, 5.8GHz onboard radio transmitter that transmits live video from the 

   onboard camera plus all the flight data from the telemetry system described above  

 

 

 
THE GROUND STATIONBASED PART OF THE SYSTEM:   
 

     A Pilot in Command (PIC) in operational control of a flight operation from beginning to 
         end and who controls the UA while in the air   

     A 100mW, 2.4GHz radio transmitter/controller operated by the PIC to control the UA 
         while in flight   

     A radio receiver receiving live video and flight data from the onboard camera and 
         computer projects it all together onto a screen for the PIC to view during flight   

     A Visual Observer (VO) is a person who provides a second pair of eyes to visually 
         track the UA while in flight.  

 
The requested exemption would support an application for a commercial Certificate of 
Authorization to use the above described CAV System to support aerial photography and 
video primarily of real property, specifically individual properties of at least two acres in size 
(equivalent to a square 295 feet/side). 
 
The UA, powered by batteries, is smaller, lighter and more maneuverable than larger aircraft 
running on combustible fuel, it operates at lower altitudes with no people on board and will 
thereby reduce current risk levels and thereby enhance safety and diminish the likelihood of 
death or serious bodily injury. With a small payload and maximum flight time of only 20 
minutes, this is offers little or no risk to national security. 
 
Low level oblique photos and video from several angles are far more effective than 
groundbased imagery for displaying the characteristics of large, complex properties with 
several buildings and large trees. Helicopters can be used, but they are more expensive to 
and not able to fly as low. The benefits of reduced cost and improved quality of presentation 
from the UA will be valuable to and benefit many buyers and sellers of real property. 
 
Additionally, we request that we be allowed to use our system to benefit first responders 
nearby who might require assistance, including fire fighters, the police, the sheriff, FEMA, et 
al., while remaining subject to all limitations cited in this application as we do so. 
 
The PD System will be operated in the field with both a PIC and a VO in accordance with FAA 
Policy N 8900.227 Section 14 "Operational Requirements for UAS" and with the following 
Restrictions: 
 
(a) No flight will be made with a UA Gross weight exceeding 55 pounds 
(b) All operations must occur in FAA Class G airspace at no more than 400 ft AGL, at an 
airspeed of no more than 25 knots and no further than 3/4 NM from the PIC 
(c) All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The VO and PIC must be able to 
communicate by voice at all times during a flight operation 
(d) Operations will be restricted to flights over private property with the permission of the 
property owner 
(e) The PIC must have accumulated and logged, in a manner consistent with 14 CFR § 61.51 
(b), a minimum of 100 flight cycles and 25 hours of total time as a UA rotorcraft pilot and at 
least ten hours logged as a UA pilot with a similar UA type 
(f) All required permits will be obtained from state and local government prior to operation 
(g) The PD System will not be operated over densely populated areas 
(h) The PD System will not be operated at air shows 
(i) The PD System will not be operated over any openair assembly of people 
(j) The PD System will not be operated over heavily trafficked roads 
(k) The PD System will not be operated within 5 NM of an airport or heliport 
(l) The PD System will not be operated over properties smaller than two acres in size 
(m) Operations will be restricted to day only and weather conditions equivalent to VFR 
(n) The PIC will brief the VO and property owner about the operation and risk before the first 
flight at each new location 
(o) No flight may be made without a PreFlight Inspection by the PIC before each operation to 
ascertain that the UA is in a condition safe for flight (see Appendix A). 
 
The PIC and VO will meet the requirements outlined in FAA Policy N 8900.227 Section 16 
personnel Qualifications. Additionally, the PIC and VO will perform maintenance on the 
system and will complete a course of maintenance instruction as part of their initial training. 
 
We submit that the combination of the UA's light weight, flight performance and ability, fully 
qualified flight crew and strict operation under the guidelines established in 8900.227, and 
under all of the Restrictions (a) through (o) listed above, the FAA can have full confidence that 
the operation will have an equivalent or greater level of safety than manned aircraft 
performing the same mission.

        ADDENDUM EXEMPTION REQUESTS AND EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY  
 
Pelican Drones, LLC, requests an exemption from the following regulations as well as any 
additional regulations that may technically apply to the operation of the CAV System:  
 
14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates This part establishes the procedures 
for the issuance of an airworthiness certificate. While the FAA continues to work to develop 
airworthiness standards for Unmanned Aerial Systems, we request an experimental certificate 
be issued for the PD System under either or both of the following provisions:  
21.191 Experimental certificates.  
Experimental certificates are issued for the following purposes:  
(a) Research and development. Testing new aircraft design concepts, new aircraft 
equipment, new aircraft installations, new aircraft operating techniques, or new uses for 
aircraft.  
(b) Showing compliance with regulations. Conducting flight tests and other operations to 
show compliance with the airworthiness regulations including flights to show compliance for 
issuance of type and supplemental type certificates, flights to substantiate major design 
changes, and flights to show compliance with the function and reliability requirements of the 
regulations.  
 
Since the experimental certificate can be used for commercial purposes such as market 
surveys, sales demonstrations, and customer crew training, we would expect that an 
experimental certificate would permit our commercial purpose as well.  
 
The aircraft will not carry persons or property, will not carry fuel, and will only fly under strict 
operational requirements. Combined with the UA's light weight, being constructed primarily of 
carbon fiber and plastic, we propose that the UA will be at least as safe, if not safer, than a 
conventionally certificated aircraft performing the same mission.  
 
If an experimental airworthiness certificate is not appropriate for this application, then we 
request an exemption of 14 CFR Part 21, Subpart H, and the requirement for an airworthiness 
certificate in general, citing the equivalent level of safety outlined in the previous paragraph.  
 
14 CFR 91.203(a) & (b) Civil aircraft: Certifications required.  
The regulation provides that an airworthiness certificate, with the registration number 
assigned to the aircraft and a registration certificate must be aboard the aircraft. Additionally, 
subparagraph (b) provides that the airworthiness certificate be "displayed at the cabin or 
cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew."  
 
At a maximum gross weight of 2.7 pounds, the UA is too small to carry documentation, does 
not have an entrance, and is not capable of carrying passengers or crew. To obtain an 
equivalent level of safety and meet the intent of 91.203, we propose that documents deemed 
appropriate for this aircraft by the FAA will be colocated with the crew at the ground control 
station and available for inspection upon request. In order to identify the aircraft, we propose 
that the information found on airworthiness and registration certificates be permanently affixed 
to the aircraft via placard containing the following information plus the word 
"EXPERIMENTAL" to satisfy the requirement of 14 CFR 45.23, which follows immediately 
after the proposed placard description below: 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Manufacturer: DJI Innovations, Inc. 
55 South A Street 
Suite 110 
Pensacola, FL 32502 
Model: Phantom Vision 2 Plus, Serial Number: PH645322375 
 
If found please contact: (850) 3592602 
 
14 CFR 45.23 Display of marks general and 45.29 Size of marks. 
These regulations provide that each aircraft must display "N" and the aircraft's registration 
number in letters at least 3 inches high. Additionally, the aircraft must display the word 
"EXPERIMENTAL" in letters at least 2 inches high near the entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or 
pilot station. The UA does not have an entrance in which the word "EXPERIMENTAL" can be 
placed, and may not have a registration number assigned to it by the FAA. 
 
We propose to achieve an equivalent level of safety by including the word "EXPERIMENTAL" 
in the placard on the top of the aircraft, as shown above, where the PIC, VO and others in the 
vicinity of the aircraft while it is preparing for launch will be able to see the designation. 
Additionally, we feel that the permanent placard discussed in the previous paragraph will 
provide the aircraft's registration information at the ground station. Finally, we will display at 
the ground station a high contrast flag or banner that contains the words "Unmanned Aircraft 
Ground Station" in letters 3 inches high or greater. Since the aircraft will operate within 3/4 
NM of the ground station, the banner should be visible to anyone that observes the aircraft 
and chooses to investigate its point of origin. 
 
14 CFR 91.9 Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard requirements. 
This regulation provides that no person may operate an aircraft unless a current, approved 
flight manual is in the aircraft. We assume that the intent of this requirement is to ensure that 
flight manual information is available to the aircrew while operating the aircraft. We request an 
exemption to this requirement since the aircraft is not only too small to carry documentation, 
the documentation would not be available to the crew during flight operations. 
 
To obtain an equivalent level of safety and meet the intent of 91.9, we propose that a current, 
approved UA Flight Manual (Appendix A) must be available to the crew at the ground station 
anytime the aircraft is in, or preparing for, flight. 
 
14 CFR 61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in Command and 61.133 
Commercial pilot privileges and limitations. 
The regulation provides that no person that holds a private pilot certificate may act as pilot in 
command of an aircraft for compensation or hire. Subparagraph (b) allows a private pilot to 
act as pilot in command of an aircraft in connection with any business or employment if: (1) 
The flight is only incidental to that business or employment and (2) The aircraft does not carry 
passengers or property for compensation or hire. 
 
Our proposed operations require that the PIC must either  
1. Hold a Commercial Pilot Certificate issued by the FAA, and have logged 25 hours of flight 
experience in this type of UA, or  
2. Meet the requirements of 8900.227 para 16(c)(2)(c) "Operations without a pilot certificate" 
in which the PIC is required to complete "FAA private pilot ground instruction" and pass "the 
FAA Private Pilot written examination." Since there are currently no means available for the 
pilot of a UAS to gain the experience in an equivalent category and class in order to apply for 
a commercial pilot's license, we propose to generate an equivalent level of safety by requiring 
our pilots to complete, at a minimum, FAA commercial pilot ground instruction and pass the 
FAA Commercial Pilot written examination in addition to completing the private pilot 
requirements. Since the aircraft cannot carry passengers or property, we feel we meet the 
intent of 61.113 Subparagraph (b) even though the intent of this application is to conduct a 
business.  
 
14 CFR 91.109 Flight Instruction Simulated instrument flight and certain flight tests 
The regulation states that "No person may operate a civil aircraft that is being used for flight 
instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls."  
 
The PD System groundbased control station consists of a small handheld radio transmitter 
and while it does not offer a second set of "controls", both the student and instructor can, and 
will, operate the single set of controls simultaneously. With both student and instructor having 
"handson" the controls during flight, we feel that this technique meets the intent 91.109 and 
provides an equivalent level of safety.  
 
14 CFR 91.119 Minimum safe altitudes: General.  
The regulation states that over sparsely populated areas the aircraft cannot be operated 
closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. Since the aircraft will be 
operating at a maximum of 400 feet AGL, we cannot comply with this requirement.  
 
In order to provide an equivalent level of safety we will only fly over private property with a 
size of at least two acres with the permission of the owner of the property flown over. The 
aircraft will not be operated over congested areas or over any open air assembly of persons. 
The property owner will be briefed on the expected route of flight and the associated risks to 
persons and property on the ground. The aircraft will be operated at a low altitude allowing, if 
a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the 
surface. Therefore we maintain that due to the small size of the UA, the hazard to persons, 
vehicles and structures is minimal compared to manned aircraft, which should be considered 
in granting the exemption.  
 
14 CFR 91.121 Altimeter settings. 
The regulation requires that aircraft shall maintain cruising altitudes by reference to an 
altimeter setting available within 100 NM of the aircraft.  
 
The UA will always fly below 400 feet AGL and will not need to maintain cruising altitudes in 
order to prevent conflict with other aircraft. An Above Ground Level altimeter measurement 
above the takeoff point is transmitted via radio from the UA onboard computer to the display 
screen held by the PIC, providing a constantly updated AGL readout. 
 
14 CFR 91.151 Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions. 
The regulation provides that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under dayVFR 
conditions unless there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and to fly after 
that for at least 30 minutes. 
 
We feel the intention of this paragraph is to provide an energy reserve as a safety buffer for 
delays to landing. The UA is battery operated and the maximum duration of flight from a 
single battery charge is 18 minutes with a 20% reserve. Since the aircraft will never fly more 
than ¾ NM from the point of intended landing, a full battery charge at launch will ensure that 
we meet the reserve energy requirement of this paragraph. We request an exemption to the 
word "fuel" and ask for an equivalent interpretation with the word "energy". 
 
14 CFR Subpart E (91.401  91.417)  Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Alterations 
The regulation provides that the operator is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft in 
an airworthy condition, including compliance with part 39 and 43. Paragraphs 91.407 and 
91.409 require that the aircraft be "approved for return to service by a person authorized 
under 43.7" after maintenance and inspection. 
 
It is our intention that the PIC perform maintenance and inspection of the aircraft and "be 
authorized to approve the aircraft for return to service." As provided in the PreFlight Checklist 
in Appendix A, the PIC will ensure that the aircraft is in an airworthy condition prior to every 
flight and in addition conduct detailed inspections after every two hours of flight. Maintenance 
performed by the PIC is limited to repairing small cracks, replacing a propeller, checking 
electrical connections and updating software and firmware for the onboard computer. All 
other maintenance will be performed by the manufacturer or their designated repair facility. 
The PIC will document work performed in accordance with 91.417. We feel that due to the 
size, construction, and simplicity of the aircraft, the PIC can ensure an equivalent level of 
safety. 
8900.227 Paragraph 16(c)(4) PIC Medical. and Paragraph 16(e)(1) Observer Medical. 
This policy provides that both the PIC and VO must have a valid FAA secondclass medical 
certificate issued under part 67 in order to perform as a pilot or observer. 
 
The UA maximum gross weight is 2.7 pounds, it is constructed of carbon fiber and plastic and 
the PIC is not on board. Both the PIC and the VO are required to be in VLOS. Given the 
unlikely event that both the PIC and VO become medically incapacitated while the aircraft is in 
flight, the UA will return autonomously to the site of launching and land without crew 
intervention. Therefore, requiring the PIC and VO to meet the same medical requirements as 
a commercial pilot carrying passengers in a large aircraft is an unnecessary burden. 
 
We propose that the minimum medical requirements for the PIC and VO be vision corrected 
to 20/20 and a valid, state issued driver's license. The 20/20 vision requirement will ensure 
that the PIC and VO can see and avoid air traffic a licensed driver is medically qualified to 
operate a much larger vehicle. 

                                                                
                                       APPENDIX A ­ FLIGHT MANUAL

(n) The PIC will brief the VO and property owner about the operation and risk before the 
first flight at each new location 
(o) No flight may be made without a successful PreFlight Inspection by the PIC before each 
operation to ascertain that the UA is in a condition safe for flight. 
 
 
PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST 
(1) Use voltmeter to determine that UA battery is fully charged in order to prevent unexpected 
premature descent 
(2) Check all wiring connections are tight 
(3) Check all propellers are undamaged and no cracks exist in any structural members of the 
UA 
(5) Turn on radio controller, check for adequate voltage, set it to connect to the UA, move all 
control switches to forward or down position and throttle control stick full back position 
(6) Connect UA main battery, check for radio contact with UA's radio receiver 
(7) At a location different from previous flight, reset GPS and compass to current location 
(8) Turn on transmitter, gimbal and camera. 
 
TO REGAIN CONTROL AFTER LOST RADIO CONTACT 
1. Failsafe = ON 
2. Throttle = 50% 
3. Mode = ATTI 
4. Failsafe = OFF 
5. Mode = GPS 
If radio contact is not restored, the UA 
will automatically continue at 60 ft 
above its last elevation before losing 
contact toward its takeoff point, then 
descend and land there autonomously

1.1 Builtin Flight Control System Instructions 
The builtin flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such 
as Pitch (forwards 
and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The 
flight controller 
contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver. 
The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a builtin inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter 
that measures both 
attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS 
(Global Position System) 
to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable 
hover. The receiver is 
used to communicate with the remote controller and the MC acts as the brains of the 
complete flight control 
system connecting and controlling all the modules together. 
The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant, by choosing NazaM mode or Phantom 
2 mode. 
This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the NazaM V2 Quick Start Manual for 
more 
information. 
1.2 Connections with Other DJI Products

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products 
1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a 
battery voltage 
(11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A. 
2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect 
can work with an 
operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and 
wireless video 
transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's 
components. If the 
total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power 
source for the 
wireless video transmission module. 
3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not 
recommended to 
use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G WiFi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) 
except the 
2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink. 
4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating 
devices away from the 
compass during installation and connection to avoid interference. 
5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of 
PHANTOM 2 has 
updated to the Version 2 shown below. H32D/H33D gimbal can be directly installed for the 
Version 2

Figure 33 
3.4 Remote Controller Operation 
The operations of remote controller are based on mode 2 stick configuration. 
Definitions 
The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote 
controller are placed at 
the central position. 
To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote controller is pushed away from the central 
position. 
Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H32D and H33D gimbal. 
Remote 
Controller 
(Mode 2) 
Aircraft 
 nose direction 
Operation details 
The throttle stick controls aircraft altitude/elevation. 
Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise. 
Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend. 
The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its 
altitude if the sticks are centered. 
Push the throttle stick above the centered (midpoint) 
position to make the aircraft take off. When flying, we 
suggest that you push the throttle stick slowly to 
prevent the aircraft from sudden and unexpected 
elevation changes.

The yaw stick controls the aircraft rudder. 
Push the stick left and the aircraft will rotate counter 
clockwise. 
Push the stick right and the aircraft will rotate 
clockwise. If the stick is centered, the aircraft will 
remain facing the same direction. 
The yaw stick controls the rotating angular velocity of 
the aircraft. Pushing the stick further away from center 
results in a faster aircraft rotation velocity. 
The pitch stick controls the aircraft's front & back tilt. 
Push the stick up and the aircraft will tilt and fly 
forward. 
Pull the stick down and the aircraft will tilt and fly 
backward. The aircraft will keep level and straight if the 
stick is centered. 
Pushing or pulling the stick further away from center 
will result in a larger tilt angle (maximum of is 35°) and 
faster flight velocity. 
The roll stick controls the aircraft's left & right tilt. 
Push the stick left and the aircraft will tilt and fly left. 
Push the stick right and the aircraft will tilt and fly right. 
The aircraft will keep level and straight if the stick is 
centered. 
Pushing the stick further away from center will result in 
a larger tilt angle (maximum of 35°) and faster flight 
velocity.

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes 
1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on. 
2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be 
discharged in an 
environment that is between 20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an 
environment 
where the relative humidity is lower than 80%. 
3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 
charge/discharge cycles. 
Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery 
can no longer 
be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power 
cycling 
procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level. 
4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong 
battery box 
securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 
months to keep it 
in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle 
(40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%). 
5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery 
over 300 times. 
Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal. 
6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged 
in any way. 
7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way. 
8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a nonflammable 
surface such as 
concrete and never near any flammable materials. 
9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass 
IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first 
flight. 
The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal 
compass data and leads to 
poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the 
compass to perform at 
its optimal level. 
5.1 Calibration Warnings 
1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong 
magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement 
underground. 
2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or 
cellular 
phones. 
3 Compass Calibration is very important otherwise the flight control system will work 
abnormally. 
5.2 Calibration Procedures 
Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the 
quick start video of the 
PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

the compass. 
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines. 
©20132015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.24 | 
6 Flight 
6.1 Flying Environment Requirements 
1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator 
to 
practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.). 
2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog. 
3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles the steel 
structure 
within buildings may interfere with the compass. 
4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc. 
5 Try to avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment 
(No base 
stations or cell towers around). 
6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole. 
7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or 
domestic 
lays and regulations. 
6.2 Starting the Motors 
A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is used to start the motors. Push the sticks according 
to one of the options 
below to start motors. Once the motors have started, release both sticks simultaneously. The 
same CSC is used to 
stop the motors. 
A B C D 
Figure 61 
6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures 
1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you. 
2. Turn on the remote controller. 
3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery. 
4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to 
Fly/Ready to Fly 
(nonGPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command. 
5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote 
Controller Operation> 
for more details. 
6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down the throttle stick to descend. The 
stick will lock into 
©20132015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.25 | 
place and the aircraft will descend steadily. 
7. After landing, leave the throttle stick down for 3 to 5 seconds to stop the motors. Return 
throttle stick to 
middle position after the motors have stopped. 
You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause 
the 
aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control. 
1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered 
into 
Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details. 
2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red 
slowly or 
rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details. 
3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information. 
4 Aircraft and battery performance is subject to environmental factors such as air density 
and 
temperature. Be very careful when flying 3000 meters (9800 feet) or more above sea level, as 
battery and aircraft performance may be reduced. 
5 When used with a H33D gimbal, a GoPro camera, and the iOSD mini, your Phantom 2 
will be very 
close to its maximum takeoff weight. It is not recommended that you attach the Phantom 2 
propeller guards at this weight. Otherwise, the aircraft will be unable to fly normally. 
6.4 Failsafe Function 
The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote controller is lost. 
The flight control 
system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or 
damage. The following 
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote controller and enter 
Failsafe mode: 
1 The remote controller is powered off. 
2 The remote controller is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the 
Failsafe (this must 
have been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant). 
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote controller. 
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote controller and the 
aircraft, essentially 
reducing the distance the signal can travel. 
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote controller. 
Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is 
initiated whether it is in 
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (nonGPS) mode. 
Ready to Fly (nonGPS)  Automatic landing 
The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note 
that the aircraft may 
be drifting during the descent and landing process. 
Ready to Fly  Automatic go home and land 
The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point 
and land. 
©20132015 DJI. All Rights Reserved.26 | 
Home Point 
When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS 
coordinates as 
the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the 
safety of being 
able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated. 
Go Home Procedures

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, 
the aircraft 
will descend automatically. 
2 When the aircraft is landing automatically, users can control the aircraft's position and 
altitude if 
the remote controller signal is recovered. 
In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready 
to fly" status 
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of 
the remote 
controller from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current 
aircraft position 
as a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid 
green blinks 
on the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is: 
1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, 
which is 
recorded last time. 
2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the 
aircraft, the 
distance will be displayed as 
D 
if using iOSD module.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function 
The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during 
flight. When it appears, 
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has 
two levels of low battery 
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the 
second appears when it has 
less than 15% power. 
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly. 
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also 
begin to descend and 
land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute 
CSC. 
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level 
warnings. This uses 10.65V 
as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will 
trigger autolanding. 
Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick. 
1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity 
warning. 
2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust 
may 
cause a communication failure. 
6.6 Flight Limits Function 
All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such 
organizations at ICAO 
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety 
reasons, the flight limits 
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits 
function includes 
height, distance limits. 
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to 
Fly (nonGPS) status, 
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m. 
(1) The default parameters in the Assistant is compliant within the definitions of class G ruled 
by 
ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its own 
rules, 
make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using the 
PHANTOM 2. 
(2) Users in Mainland China can refer to . 
Max Height & Radius Limits 
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done 
in the PHANTOM 2 
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.

Semiautomatic descent: All stick commands are available except the throttle stick command 
during 
the descent and landing process. Motors will stop automatically after landing. Users will 
regain control 
once the motors have stopped. There is no need to toggle the S1 switch. 
(1) When flying in the airspace (A/B/C) of restricted special area, LED flight indicators will 
blink red 
quickly and continue for 3 seconds, then switch to indicate current flying 
status and continue for 5 seconds at which point it will switch back to red blinking. 
(2) For safety reasons, please do not fly close to airports, highways, railway stations, railway 
lines, 
city centers and other special areas. Try to ensure the aircraft is visible. 
6.8 Conditions of Flight Limits 
In different working modes and flight modes, flight limits will differ according to number of 
GPS satellites found.
