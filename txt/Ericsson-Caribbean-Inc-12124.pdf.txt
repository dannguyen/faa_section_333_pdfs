                                                           Exemption No. 12124
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015­1592

Mr. Francisco A. Rullan
Legal Counsel
Ericsson Caribbean, Inc.
City View Plaza II
Guaynabo, PR 00968

Dear Mr. Rullan:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 30, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Ericsson Caribbean, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption. The
petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct aerial
photography and visual surveys.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
                                                                                                                 2

consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection1. The FAA has issued grants of
exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects to those presented in your petition.
In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352),
11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see
Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and 11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned
aircraft (UA) with the specifications described by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in
addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled
by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

 They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

 The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

 A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Ericsson Caribbean, Inc. is granted an exemption from
14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to
the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection.
This exemption is subject to the conditions and limitations listed below.

1 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Ericsson Caribbean, Inc. is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
         Vision+ when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations
         of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

    2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
         not permitted.

    3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
         exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
         compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
         airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
         aircraft manufacturer.

    4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
         (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

    5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
         This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
         corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
         U.S. driver's license.

    6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
         the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
         to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
         capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
         electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
         must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
         duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
         required of the VO.

    7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
         operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
         exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
         documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
         Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
         limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
         the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
                                                                                                               6

       (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
       be as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
       These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)

Dear Sir or Madam:

Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform
Act) and 14 CFR. Part 11 , Ericsson Caribbean, Inc. ("Ericsson"), a provider of
telecommunications and data technology services, hereby applies for an exemption
from the listed Federal Aviation Regulations ("FARs") to allow commercial operation of
its Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems ("sUASs") for aerial photography and visual
surveys of telecom sites ("sites") in various projects as part of the service delivery, so
long as such operations are conducted within and under the conditions outlined herein
or as may be established by the FAA as required by Section 333.
As detailed in this document and the attached Operations Manual, the requested
exemption would permit the operation of sUAS under controlled conditions in
airspace that is 1) limited, 2) predetermined, 3) controlled as to access, and 4) would
provide safety enhancements to the already best practices safety protocols followed
by Ericsson at each one of its sites. Approval of this exemption would thereby
enhance safety and fulfill the Secretary of Transportation's (the FAA Administrator's)
responsibilities to "...establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft
systems in the national airspace system." Section 333 (c) of the Reform Act.

I. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR EXEMPTIONS

The Federal Aviation Act expressly grants the FAA authority to issue exemptions. This
statutory authority includes exempting civil aircraft, as the term is defined under
§40101 of the Act, including sUASs, from the requirement that all civil aircraft must
have a current airworthiness certificate.

The Administrator may grant an exemption from a requirement of a regulation
prescribed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section or any sections 44702-44716 of
this title if the Administrator finds the exemption in the public interest. 49 U.S.C.
§44701(f) See also 49 USC §44711 (a) ; 49 USC §44704; 14 CFR 91 .203 (a) (1).
Section 333(b} of the Reform Act assists the Secretary in determining whether sUASs
may operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) without creating a hazard to the
user, the public, or a threat to national security. In making this determination, the
Secretary must consider:

· The sUAS's size, weight, speed , and operational capability;
· Whether the sUAS operates within the visual line of sight of the operator
· Whether the sUAS operates outside of highly populated areas and away from

        close proximity to airports
Reform Act §333 (a). If the Secretary determines that a sUAS "may operate safely in the

Ericsson's sUASs are multirotor vehicles, weighting 10 lbs. or less including payload.
They operate under normal conditions at a speed of no more than 50 knots and have
the capability to hover and move in the vertical and horizontal plane
simultaneously. The sUASs will operate only in the pilot's and/or assistants visual line
of sight at all times and will operate within the restricted private areas as described in the
Flight Operations Manual, attached as Exhibit 1 (hereinafter "the Operations Manual")
Adherence to the Manual will insure that the sUASs will "not create a hazard to users
of the national airspace system or the public." Reform Act Section 333 (b).

Given the small size of the sUASs involved and the restricted and sterile environment
within which they will operate, our application falls squarely within the zone of safety
(an equivalent level of safety) in which Congress envisioned that the FAA must, by
exemption, allow commercial operations of sUASs to commence immediately.

Also due to the small size of the sUASs and the low altitudes (less than 400 feet AGL)
and restricted private areas in which our sUASs will operate, approval of the
application presents no national security issue.

Given the clear direction in Section 333 of the Reform Act, the authority contained
in the Federal Aviation Act, as amended; the strong equivalent level of safety surrounding
the proposed operations, and the significant public benefit, including enhanced
safety, the grant of the requested exemptions is in the public interest. Accordingly,
Ericsson respectfully requests that the FAA grant the requested exemption without
delay.

ll. PUBLIC INTEREST

This exemption application is expressly submitted to fulfill Congress' goal in passing
Section 333 (a) through (c) of the Reform Act. This law directs the Secretary of
Transportation to consider whether certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate
safely in the NAS before completion of the rulemaking required under Section 332
of the Reform Act. By granting an exemption the FAA will fulfill Congress's intent of
allowing UAS to operate with significant safety precautions in low risk environments.

The use of sUASs on a site can significantly reduce the risk to workers of falls while
surveying, inspecting or monitoring site progress (e.g., some of the cell towers in
Puerto Rico are as tall as 300 feet) . sUASs can inspect, photograph , and collect data
on hard to get to areas that otherwise would require worker inspection. Falls are the
leading source of workplace fatality and injury on construction sites1 , and reducing
falls through sUAS use for site imaging could save workers lives.

Additionally, sUASs could replace the use of helicopters and small aircraft to monitor
telecom sites. The sUASs we propose to fly in this application have a weight less than
10 pounds, and carry no combustible material on board, as opposed to the much
larger conventionally powered small aircraft. Shifting to sUASs from helicopters
presents a marked safety increase for our workers and the public.

Lastly, sUASs reduce the environmental impact by dramatically decreasing the energy
used for aerial imaging and data collection over a site. Our sUASs use rechargeable

                                                                                                                                    3

are many hundreds of times heavier.

ill. EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF SAFETY
Ericsson proposes that the exemption requested herein apply to civil aircraft that have
the characteristics and that operate with the limitations listed herein. These
limitations provide for at least an equivalent or even higher level of safety to operations
under the current regulatory structure because the proposed operations represent a
safety enhancement to the already safe protocols followed on data and
telecommunication sites and imaging and surveying operations conducted with
helicopters and other conventional aircraft.

Ericsson will be bound by the following limitations when conducting its sUAS operations
under an FAA issued exemption:

     1. Safety will be the first and foremost consideration in any sUAS operation.
     2. The MTOM weight of the sUAS will be less than 10 lbs.
     3. Minimum crew for each operation will consist of the sUAS PIC.
     4. An observer will be utilized if the sUAS in any case will be flown outside line of

          sight for the pilot. Flights therefore always will be operated within line of sight of
          the pilot and/or an assistant at all times. The observer, if required and pilot will
          at all times be able to communicate by voice and/or text.
    5. Maximum total flight time for each operational flight will be 25 minutes. The sUAS
          calculates battery reserve in real time. The sUAS has two levels of low battery
          capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power
          and the second appears when it has less than 15% power. The sUAS will return
          to its ground station with at least 15% battery power reserve should that occur
          prior to the 25 minute flight time.
     6. Flights will be operated normally at an altitude of 200 feet AGL, never exceeding
          400 feet AGL.
     7. Flights will be operated in Class G airspace whenever possible. If operation in
          other airspace is required, the relevant controlling agency will be notified at
          least 24 hours prior to the operation and, if required, any necessary permission
          obtained.
     8. Flights will be operated at daylight and under visibility and cloud clearance
          requirements equivalent to Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
     9. The sUAS will at all times give way to any aircraft carrying persons.

                                                                                                                                 4

     10. Prior to a sUAS flight, an area of operation will be established. This area of
          operation will include a defined lateral and vertical area, where the sUAS will
          operate. Safety procedures will be established for persons, property and
          applicable airspace within the area of operation.

     11 . Ericsson's sUAS aircraft will utilize GPS navigation, failsafe , automatic Return-
          To-Home (RTH) and/or flight abort safety features when appropriate for the
          operation.

     12. A briefing will be conducted in regard to the planned sUAS operations prior to
          operation at each new location. All personnel who will be performing duties
          within the boundaries of the area of operation will be present for this briefing .

     13. All required permissions and permits will be obtained from appropriate state,
          county or city jurisdictions, including local law enforcement, fire , or other
          appropriate governmental agencies.

     14. Written and/or oral permission from the relevant property owners will be
          obtained prior to an operation.

     15. The pilot will have been trained in operation of sUASs generally and received
          up-to-date information on the particular sUAS to be operated as required in the
          Operations Manual.

     16. The pilot must poses at least a second class medical certificate

     17. The sUAS pilot will be trained in advance for the safe operation of the sUAS to
          be operated . This will include operation of the sUAS both in normal and
          emergency modes of operation , and will include familiarization with the
          Operations Manual. Training will also include types of maneuvers to be
          performed and the safe operation in relation to persons, property and applicable
          airspace.

     18. The sUAS pilot will establish a working relationship with a representative at the
          local Right Sta1dards District Offioos (FSOO) with which to annually review safety
          procedures and other operations to further enhance safety.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC REGULATIONS

14 CFR Part 21 , Subpart H: Airworthiness Certificates 14 CFR 91.203 (a) (1)
Subpart II, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements
for the issuance of airworthiness certificates as required by FAR 91 .203 (a) (1). Given
the size and limited operating area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by the
Ericsson, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H meets the requirements of an
equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and Section 333 of the Reform Act. The
Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C.§44701 (f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both
authorize the FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness
certificate, upon consideration of the size, weight, speed , operational capability, and
proximity to airports and populated areas of the particular UAS. In our particular case,
the sUASs that we are intending to use are small , and will operate at slow speeds,
close to the ground, far from airports and in a low risk, low population environment. An
analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the sUAS operated without an

                                                                                                                            5

ERICSSON

airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions
proposed will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or
helicopter) operating with an airworthiness certificate without the restrictions and
conditions proposed.

The sUAS to be operated hereunder is less than 10 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a
pilot nor passenger, carries no explosive materials or flammable liquid fuels, and
operates exclusively within a secured area as set out in the Operations Manual. Like
other civil aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly controlled and
monitored by the operator, pursuant to the Operations Manual's requirements, and
under the requirements and in compliance with local public safety requirements, to
provide security for the area of operation as is currently done on active sites. The FAA
will have advance notice of all operations.

These safety enhancements, which already apply to civil aircraft operated in
connection with sites, provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property
owners than conventional operations conducted with airworthiness certificates
issued under 14 CFR Part 21 , Subpart H. Lastly, application of these same criteria
demonstrates that there is no credible threat to national security posed by the sUAS,
due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack of explosive
materials or flammable liquid fuels, and ability to carry an external load no greater
than two lbs.

14 CFR 45.23 (b): Marking of the Aircraft and 14 CFR 45.27 (a): Location of
marks; nonfixed-wing aircraft

This regulation requires certain experimental, provisionally certificated aircraft, or light-
sport category aircraft to be marked with letters between 2 inches and 6 inches high
"limited," "restricted," "light-sport," "experimental," or "provisional," near each entrance
to a cabin, cockpit, or pilot station.

Even though the sUAS will have no airworthiness certificate , an exemption may be
needed as the sUAS will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on
which the word "Experimental" can be placed. Given the size of the sUAS , two-inch
lettering will be impossible.

The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the sUAS marked with the
word "Experimental" will be placed one of the arms of the sUAS in compliance with
45.29 (f) and on both sides of the UAS in compliance with 45.27 (a) where the pilot,
observer and others working with the sUAS will see the identification of the sUAS as
"Experimental." The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation:
Exemptions Nos. 10700, 8738, 10167 and 10167A.

                                                                                                                          6
=---'ERICSSON

14 CFR 61.113 (a) & (b): Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in
command

Sections 61 .113 (a) & (b) limit private pilots to non-commercial operations. Because
the sUAS will not carry a pilot or passengers, the proposed operations can achieve
the equivalent level of safety of current operations by requiring the pilot operating
the aircraft to have completed a sUAS flight training course of at least 50 hours before
flying a sUAS. Unlike a conventional aircraft that carries the pilot and passengers, the
sUAS is remotely controlled with no living thing or cargo on board. The area of operation
is controlled and restricted , and all flights are planned and coordinated in advance as
set forth in the Operations Manual. The risks associated with the operation of the
sUAS are so diminished from the level of risk associated with commercial
operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that allowing operations of the
sUAS as requested with a pilot who has met the minimum requirements stated in
chapter 2.2 of the Operations Manual exceeds the present level of safety achieved by
14 CFR 61 .113 (a) & (b).

14 CFR 91.7 (a): Civil aircraft airworthiness

The regulation requires that no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in airworthy
condition. As there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft, should this
exemption be granted, no FAA regulatory standard will exist for determining
airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft and the requirements contained in the
Operations Manual for maintenance and use of safety checklists prior to each flight,
an equivalent level of safety will be provided.

14 CFR 91.9 (b) (2): Civil aircraft flight manual, marking, and placard
requirements

The sUAS , given its size and configuration has no ability or place to carry such a flight
manual on the aircraft, not only because there is no pilot on board, but because there is
no room or capacity to carry such an item on the aircraft.

The equivalent level of safety will be maintained by keeping the Operations Manual at
the ground control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access
to it. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this regulation : Exemption Nos.
8607,
8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565, 95658, 10167, 10167A, 10602, 32827, and10700.

                                                                                                                                 7
-=-'ERICSSON

14 CFR 91.103: Preflight Action
This regulation requires each pilot in command take certain actions before flight to
ensure the safety of flight. An exemption is needed from this requirement as the pilot
will take separate preflight actions, including checking for weather conditions, checking
flight battery requirements, checking takeoff and landing distances, and all other
actions in the Preflight Checklist in the Manual. These actions will provide an equivalent
level of safety.

14 CFR 91.105: Flight crewmembers at stations
This regulation defines the obligations of the flight crewmembers during takeoff and
landing, and while en route. This part is not applicable due to the sUAS is not carrying
any flight crewmembers.

Ericsson will not operate the aircraft unless someone is at the controls at all times. Each
flight will be manual, with the exception when the sUAS goes into emergency mode
like return-to-home. This will achieve an equivalent level of safety to 14 CFR. 91.105.
because the flight crew will be at their stations at all times during the flight. The stations
will not be on the aircraft but on the ground.

14 CFR 91.109: Flight Instruction
Section 91 .103 provides that no person may operate a civil aircraft (except a manned
free balloon) that is being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully
functioning dual controls.

By design , sUASs and remotely piloted aircraft do not have fully functional dual
controls. Flight control is accomplished through the use of a control box that
communicates with the aircraft via radio communications. The FAA has previously
approved exemptions for aircraft without fully functional dual controls. See Exemption
Nos.5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of safety provided by the fact that neither a
pilot nor passengers will be carried in the aircraft, the ability to control the sUAS via
radio signals from the controller, and by the size and speed of the aircraft.

14 CFR 91.119: Minimum Safe Altitudes

Section 91 .119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91 .119
(d) allows helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided
the person operating the helicopter complies w ith any route or altitudes prescribed
for helicopters by the FAA. This exemption is for a multirotor craft that flies similarly to
a helicopter, with vertical take-off and vertical landing, which will typically operate at
altitudes of 200 feet AGL, so an exemption may be needed to allow such
operations. The sUAS will never operate at altitude higher than 400 feet AGL and will
be in a restricted area with security perimeter, where buildings and people will not be
exposed to operations without their pre-obtained consent. See Manual for detailed
procedures.

                                                                                                                          8

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the
sUAS as well as the location where it is operated . No flight will be taken without the
permission of the property owner or local officials. Because of the advance notice to
the property owner and any onsite personnel as outlined in the Manual, all affected
individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations. Compared to flight
operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighting far more than the maximum 10 lbs.
proposed herein and carrying flammable fuel, any risk associated with our operations is
far less than those presently presented with helicopters and other conventional aircraft
operating at or below 500 feet AGL in the construction industry. In addition, the low-
altitude operations of the sUAS will ensure separation between these sUAS
operations and the operations of conventional aircraft that must comply with Section
91.119.

14 CFR 91.121: Altimeter Settings
This regulation requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by
reference to an altimeter that is set "...to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure." As the sUAS may not have a
barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS altitude read out, an exemption may be
needed. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by the operator, pursuant to the
Manual and Safety Check list, confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the
GPS altitude indicator before flight.

14 CFR 91.151 (a): Fuel requirements for flight in VFR conditions

Section 91 .151 (a) outlines fuel requirements for beginning a flight in VFR conditions.
Our sUAS is limited to operations in sterile and controlled environments as outlined in the
Manual, and has a limited range and flight time which require an exemption from 14 CFR
91 .151 (a) .

The battery powering the sUAS provides approximately 25 minutes of powered flight. To
meet the 30 minute reserve requirement in 14 CFR 91 .151 , sUAS flights would not
be possible to perform. Given the limitations on the sUAS's proposed flight area
and the location of its proposed operations within a predetermined area, a longer time
frame for flight in daylight is reasonable.

Ericsson believes that an exemption from 14 CFR 91 .151 (a) falls within the scope of
prior exemptions. See Exemption 11191 (allowing Singer's Creation to operate
without compliance with FAR 91 .151 (a)).

Operating the sUAS, in a tightly controlled area where only people and property
owners or official representatives who have signed waivers will be allowed, with less
than 30 minutes of reserve fuel, does not engender the type of risks that Section 91.151
(a) was intended to alleviate given the size and speed of the sUAS.

The sUAS calculates battery reserve in real time. The sUAS has two levels of low
battery capacity warning that are presented on the monitoring system. The first appears
when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has less

                                                                                                                          9

ERICSSON

than 15% power. The sUAS will return to its ground station with at least 15% battery
power reserve should that occur prior to the 25 minute flight time.

An equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limiting flights to 20 minutes, or enough
battery reserve to ensure that the sUAS lands at the ground station with at least 15%
of battery power (as determined by the onboard monitoring system and the pilot),
whichever happens first. This restriction would be more than adequate to return the
sUAS to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its limited operating area.

Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions
2689F, 5745, 10673, 10808 and 11191 .

14 CFR 91 .203 (a) & (b): Carrying civil aircraft certificatio n and registration

The regulation provides in part:

(a) Except as provided in 91 .715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has
within it the following:

(1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate.. ..
(b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
paragraph (a) of this section or a special flight authorization issued under 91.715 is
displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

The sUAS fully loaded weighs no more than 10 lbs. and is operated without an onboard
pilot. Therefore there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration
documents or to display them on the sUAS.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the
ground flight control point where the pilot flying the sUAS will have immediate access
to them, to the extent they are applicable to the sUAS. The FAA has issued numerous
exemptions to this regulation. A representative sample of other exceptions includes
Exemption Nos. 9565, 9665, 9789, 9789A, 9797, 9797A, 9816A, and 10700.

14 CFR 91 .405 (a); 407 (a) (1); 409 (a) (2); 417 (a) & (b): Maintenance
inspections

These regulations require that an aircraft operator or owner "shall have that aircraft
inspected as prescribed in subpart E of this part and shall between required
inspections, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies
repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter...," and others shall inspect or maintain
the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness
certificate, these sections will not apply to Ericsson. Maintenance will be accomplished
by the operator pursuant to the flight manual and operating handbook as referenced in
the Manual. An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because these sUASs are
very limited in size and will carry a small payload and operate only in restricted areas for
limited periods of time. If mechanical issues arise the sUAS can land immediately and

                                                                                                                 10

will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL. As provided in the Manual, the
operator will ensure that the sUAS is in working order prior to initiating flight, perform
required maintenance, and keep a log of any maintenance performed. Moreover, the
operator is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best suited to maintain the
aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

8900.227 Paragraph 16 (c) (4) PIC Medical. and Paragraph 16 (e) (1) Observer
Medical.
This policy provides that both the PIC and observer must have a valid FAA second-
class medical certificate issued under part. 67 in order to perform as a pilot or observer.
Requiring the crew to meet the same medical requirements as commercial pilot
carrying passengers in a large aircraft is an unnecessary burden. We propose that the
minimum medical requirements be vision corrected to 20/20 and a valid , state-issued
driver's license. The risk of both the PIC and observer becoming incapacitated at the
same time and suddenly is very low. Further, since the sUAS is operating close to the
ground, it could be brought in for landing in a very short time if incapacitation was
suspected. Finally, most sUAS's are equipped with an automatic return to home feature
which would provide a final level of safety. We feel this would provide an equivalent
level of safety.

Pursuant to 14 CFR Part 11, the following summary is provided for publication in the
Federal Register, should it be determined that publication is needed:
Applicant seeks an exemption from the following rules:14 CFR 21, subpart H; 14 CFR

91.409 (a) (2); 91 .409 (a) (2) & 91.417 (a) & (b); 8900.227 §16 (c) (4) and §16 (e) (1) to

operate commercially a small unmanned vehicle (55 lbs. or less) in various data and
telecommunication projects and installations as part of the service delivery,

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUASs in the data and
telecommunication industry enhances safety while reducing risk. Manned aircraft
monitoring and surveying creates a greater risk because the craft are much larger,
have combustible fuel, and carry an onboard human pilot. In contrast, a sUAS weighing
fewer than 10 lbs. and powered by batteries eliminates virtually all of that risk given
the reduced mass and lack of combustible fuel carried on board. The sUAS will
carry no passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks
associated with manned aircraft flights.

The operation of sUASs, weighting less than 10 lbs., conducted in the strict
conditions outlined above, will provide an equivalent level of safety supporting the
grant of the exemptions requested herein, including exempting the applicant from
the requirements of Part 21 and allowing commercial operations . These lightweight
aircraft operate at slow speeds, close to the ground, and in a sterile environment and,
as a result , are far safer than conventional operations conducted with turbine
helicopters operating in close proximity to the ground and people.

1.1  Purpose
1.2
     The purpose of this document is to detail the items to be covered for the operation of the
1.3  DJI Phantom Vision 2+ Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) by Ericsson Caribbean
     Inc. personnel.

     Scope

     This operations manual applies to all personnel involved with the operation of the DJI
     Phantom Vision 2+.

     By law, any aircraft operation in the national airspace requires a certificated and registered
     aircraft, a licensed pilot, and operational approval. Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and
     Reform Act of 2012 (FMRA) grants the Secretary of Transportation the authority to determine
     whether an airworthiness certificate is required for a UAS to operate safely in the National
     Airspace System (NAS). A Small Unmanned Aircraft System [sUAS] is defined by the
     Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] A UAS is the unmanned aircraft (UA) and all of the
     associated support equipment, control station, data links, telemetry, communications and
     navigation equipment, etc., necessary to operate the unmanned aircraft.

     The UA is the flying portion of the system, flown by a pilot via a ground control system, or
     autonomously through use of an on-board computer, communication links and any
     additional equipment that is necessary for the UA to operate safely. The FAA issues an
     experimental airworthiness certificate for the entire system, not just the flying portion of
     the system.

     This authority is being leveraged to grant case-by-case authorization for certain unmanned
     aircraft to perform commercial operations prior to the finalization of the Small UAS Rule, which
     will be the primary method for authorizing small UAS operations once it is complete.

     The Section 333 Exemption process provides operators who wish to pursue safe and legal
     entry into the NAS a competitive advantage in the UAS marketplace, thus discouraging illegal
     operations and improving safety. It is anticipated that this activity will result in significant
     economic benefits, and the FAA Administrator has identified this as a high priority project to
     address demand for civil operation of UAS for commercial purposes.

4    Flight Planning and Preparation

4.1  Determination of intended task and feasibility
4.2
     Before the commencement of any operation, Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS Operator will
4.3  evaluate the proposed task, ensure that the operation is possible within the bounds of
4.4  safety, regulation and practicality, and if the desired outcome is achievable for the activity.
     If the operation falls outside these bounds and cannot be modified to comply, it will not be
     undertaken.

     Operating Site Location and assessment

          · Before the commencement of any operation, Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS
               Operator will research the proposed locations suitability for sUAS operations .

          · This may include:

          · Aeronautical map information to check the proximity of the proposed site to
               airfields, the airspace the location falls inside and any Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
               which may affect the operation.

          · Proximity to obstacles such as structures, buildings & bridges.

          · Proximity to any source of radio interference such as high intensity radio masts,
               power lines.

          · Proximity to residential housing and populace.

          · The topography of the area.

          · Retrieving information and contact details on local Police Office Stations, hospitals
               and fire brigade in the event of an emergency.

     Risk Management

     A risk assessment matrix (Appendix D) shall be used to help evaluate the potential risks of
     a particular operation and highlight the areas where safety gains may be made. If not
     enough can be done to mitigate the highlighted risks and the calculated value considered
     too high, the operation will be cancelled.

     Pre-notification

     Should the site fall within a congested area, controlled airspace of within 5NM/ 8KM of an
     aerodrome boundary, contact will be made with the FAA and controlling authority
     requesting permission for the operation. The operation will only take place after written
     permission has been achieved. If applicable, local Police Office may also be notified.
4.5  Site Permissions
4.6
4.7  Permission must be obtained from those within 50m of take-off & landing.
4.8
4.9  Additional permission from site providers or agents must be sought in accordance with
     site access requirements & agreements.

     Weather

     The sUAS Operator must familiarize themselves with the long range weather forecasts for
     the area. This will inform the Operator of the conditions likely to be faced at the site and
     any precautions which should be taken. In the event of weather conditions that fall
     outside of the operational envelope of the aircraft, the operation will be cancelled or
     postponed. Onsite weather checks will also be carried out by the sUAS Operator.

     Preparation and serviceability of equipment and sUAS

     Before an operation, a pre-flight check will also be made of the aircraft as shown in the
     pre-flight checklist in Appendix B.

     If any maintenance or repair works have been carried out on the aircraft, a flight test will
     be carried out to prove serviceability and safety. The sUAS will be serviced by an
     approved competent person annually, and replaced after 10,000 flight hours.

     Software Upgrades and Calibration

     During Preparation the sUAS Operator is to conduct a check for SW upgrades and
     Calibration of the GPS system on board the aircraft. This requires periodic checks for
     software updates. The application required- DJI Phantom 2- Naza-M Assistant Software
     v2.20

     Charging and fitting Batteries

     Lithium Polymer batteries are used to power Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS. An
     undesirable by-product of these batteries is the ability to self-combust. Caution must be
     used in the care and management of the flight packs. Flight batteries may be charged
     using chargers approved by the sUAS Manufacturer specifications & in accordance with
     Manufacturer guidelines. Flight packs will have their cell voltages recorded before and
     after charging in the battery log. (See Appendix C)

     Real time monitoring of flight pack voltage will be available to the pilot on an on screen
     display via live telemetry.
5 On Site Procedures

5.1 Site Survey

                        Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS Operator will carry out the onsite survey to check that the
                        site is as expected from the research on the intended location. Any variations on this
                        information will be evaluated to ensure continued safety and suitability of the operation.

5.2 Selection of operating areas and alternatives

                        Onsite, a suitable take-off and landing site will be chosen that fits the requirements of the
                        operation. A second landing site may also be chosen if there is the possibility of the first
                        being compromised.

5.3 Crew Briefing

                        Before the operation commences the crew must be briefed on the following :

                                         · The purpose of the operation

                                         · Applicable airspace considerations
                                         · Individual's responsibilities

                                         · Relevant safety information
                                         · Emergency procedures

5.4 Controlled Access Measures

                        Having paced the area in which the Operation will take place the sUAS Operator should
                        identify landmarks on the periphery of the operation so as to provide a reference for the
                        restricted area.
                        In each case the sUAS Operator should consider whether it is appropriate to place
                        restrictions [cordon off] the take-off and landing area in order to keep third parties safe
                       from sUAS operations.
5.5  Communications

5.6  Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS Operator should ensure they have full concentration on the
5.7  Operation & to consider the risk of external distractions as part of the Operation Risk
     assessment. If operating as a lone worker, the sUAS Operator is prohibited from using
     other communications devices, non-essential to the Operation.

     Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS operations crew may communicate using two way radio
     headsets. This will ensure that difficult communication due to outside noise or distance
     between the crew will not compromise the safety or efficiency of the operation. If
     applicable the payload operator will have an ear free in order to listen to 3m Party input, or
     outside warnings. The pilot will receive any safety warnings or 3m Party input via the
     payload operator. This ensures no disturbance to the pilot's concentration from unwanted
     sources and only essential information is relayed . The pre-flight briefing will cover the
     eventuality of crew communications failure and the procedures to be taken. These
     communications devices will not operate on a conflicting frequency to any flight operations
     equipment and Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS Operators will hold any radio license (if
     required) to operate them.

     Weather Checks

     Forecasts will be updated before all flights & captured in the Risk Assessment. Wind
     speed will be measured using handheld anemometer prior to take off & recorded in the
     flight log checklist.

     Loading of equipment

     All payloads must be operated within the range limitations set down in the manufacturer's
     manual. However, payloads on the Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS cannot be altered. The
     Phantom Vision 2+ has an integrated Camera/Gimbal Unit that is not modular. Correct
     function will be assessed onsite before attempting the operations.
6    FLIGHT PROCEDURES

6.1  Checklists are employed to ensure all equipment needed is present, that the sUAS to be
6.2  flown is in an airworthy condition and that steps are taken in the correct sequence and
     without omission. In cases where are two party crew are onsite both personnel should be
     involved in checklist completion , and if this is the case, a 'challenge-response' method will
     be utilized.

     Pre-embarkation

     A pre-embarkation checklist ensures all equipment needed to safely complete an
     operation is present.

     Pre-flight

     The pre-flight checklist runs through the procedure used to inspect the aircraft and
     payload to ensure its airworthiness. This also includes a last-minute voltage check of the
     flight batteries to ensure sufficient charge. The sUAS Operator should take time to assess
     the area in which the Operation will commence. This includes pacing the local &
     identifying the primary & a secondary landing area (as per Checklist).

     The Ericsson Caribbean Inc. sUAS flight limits are configured within per FAA regulations.

6.3  Start-up

6.4  The start-up checklist runs through the power-up procedures of all flight operation
6.5  equipment to the take-off phase of flight. sUAS modes will be confirmed through LED &
     on-screen display indications (OSD). The pilot will announce 'Rotors On' before
6.6  application of power.

     Take-off

     When the sUAS Operator is ready for take-off, after a last scan to ensure no hazards
     exist, the pilot will start the timer and announce 'taking off before starting the engines.
     The aircraft will then lift-off to a height of around 4-6ft off the ground to clear the ground
     effect of its propellers. A flight controls check is then performed to satisfy the pilot that the
     aircraft responds as it should to his control input before departing to start the task.

     In flight

     The sUAS Operator's primary concern whilst airborne is the safety of personnel and other
     airspace users.

     The sUAS Operator will:

     · Ensure that all regulations are adhered to.

     · Monitor elapsed flight-time and ensure to land before the estimated time for battery
          depletion as well as monitoring LED/ OSD indications for low power.

     · Fly the sUAS with anticipation of potential failures at all times and will ensure Failsafe
          and Return-to-home (RTH) features are armed at all times.

     · Sacrifice the craft over the safety of personnel and property.

     · Landing

     · After returning from the operation, the pilot will scan the landing site for hazards.
          Once satisfied, the pilot will call 'Landing' before lowering the aircraft to the ground.

     Shut-down

     When the sUAS has come to a rest after landing, the shut-down checklist will be
     completed. Upon shutdown of the rotors the pilot will call 'rotors off and will never apply
     further power without briefing the crew. Subsequent actions will include unplugging the
     aircrafts flight batteries first to make the aircraft safe and then on to the shut-down of radio
     links, video uplinks and the payload. Other than the safety aspect of unplugging the flight
     packs, the main aim of the shut-down checklist is to ensure that no equipment is left on.

     Specific checklists are attached and featured in Appendix B of this manual.
7 Absolute Rules

                        Regardless of whether segregated airspace has been granted or not, LM Ericsson IAA
                        Permission for Aerial Work and Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of
                       2012 (FMRA) and the Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Federal Register I Vol. 80,
                       No. 35 I Monday, February 23, 2015 I Proposed Rules: Operation and Certification of
                        Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems. 14 CFR Parts 21 , 43, 45, 47, 61 , 91 , 101 , 107, and

                                  than 500 meters from the point of operation. Operators may work with a visual
                                  observer, but the operator still must be able to maintain visual line of sight

                             · sUAS shall not be operated at a height of more than 400 feet (120 meters) above
                                  ground level and no faster than 100 mph

                             · Flights must take place during daylight hours

                             · The operator must assess weather conditions, airspace restrictions and the
                                  location of people to lessen risks if he or she loses control of the sUAS

                             · sUAS shall not be operated over or within the confines of a congested area except
                                  with the written permission of the Authority

                             · sUAS shall not be operated over any assembly of persons on the ground nor
                                  closer than 150 meters laterally from such an assembly

                            · sUAS shall not be operated within 150 meters of any person , vessel, vehicle or
                                  structure not under the control of the sUAS operator; during take-off or landing
                                  however, the aircraft must not be flown within 50 meters of any person , unless that
                                  person is under the control of the sUAS operator.

                             · sUAS shall not be operated within an aerodrome traffic zone or closer than 8
                                  kilometers (5 nautical miles) from an aerodrome boundary, whichever is the
                                  greatest distance, except with the written permission of the Air Controlling
                                  Authority.

                            · sUAS shall not be operated closer than 2 kilometers from an aircraft in flight. The
                                  operator must always see and avoid manned aircraft. If there is a risk of collision,
                                  the drone operator must be the first to maneuver away

                            · sUAS must stay out of airport flight paths and restricted airspace areas, and obey
                                  any FAA Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)

                            · sUAS shall not be operated unless there is in place a third party liability insurance
                                  policy covering the operation of the system which is acceptable to the Authority

                            · The drone must be registered and aircraft markings are required

                            · Operators must be 17 years old, pass an aeronautical knowledge test, hold an
                                  FAA UAS operator certificate, and pass a TSA background check.

                            · Aeronautical knowledge testing must be renewed every 24 months (no private pilot
                                  license or medical rating would be required)
· Operators must ensure their aircraft is safe for flight, but there are no
     airworthiness standards or certification requirements (a preflight inspection

    conducted by the operator, checking communications links and equipment is

     sufficient)

· Operators must report an accident to the FAA within 10 days of any operation that
     results in injury or property damage

· No operations are allowed in Class A (18,000 feet & above) airspace. Operations
     in Class B, C, D and E airspace are allowed with the required ATC permission ,
     Operations in Class G airspace are allowed without ATC permission

· The proposed rule maintains the existing prohibition against operating in a
     careless or reckless manner. It also would bar an operator from allowing any
     object to be dropped from the UAS

· The operator must discontinue the flight when continuing would pose a hazard to
     other aircraft, people or property
8    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

8.1  Loss of power to engine
8.2
8.3  Motor failures may cause the sUAS to enter an uncontrolled descent. Multi-rotor aircraft
     have no gliding capability and this kind of failure will certainly result in a crash . A loud
8.4  warning will be called by the sUAS Operator to anyone near to make them aware of the
     situation and potential danger.
8.5
     Aircraft Battery Failure

     This is the same as total motor failure on single battery aircraft. The aircraft will quickly
     descend to the ground, uncontrollably with no power. Should the battery fail, the aircraft
     will descend uncontrolled, and a loud warning will be called to help those around to avoid
     the danger.

     Transmitter Battery Failure

     The Ericsson Caribbean Inc. Puerto Rico sUAS are equipped with an integrated Failsafe
     System. This system is set up to "fail safe" in the event of loss of control link to the aircraft
     which is what will happen in this event. Failsafe mode will give control to the flight
     controller which will climb the aircraft to 60m altitude if below that height, or stay at its
     present height, if above 60m. The aircraft will then return on this altitude above its
     departure point and wait for 30 seconds to see if it can re-establish the control link.
     Should this not be possible, the aircraft will auto-land at its departure point and shut-down
     its motors, the shut-down checklist will then be read by the sUAS Operator. The
     designated sUAS Operator will ensure this mode is armed before flight.

     Loss of Control Frequency

     Having been pre-configured as part of the pre-flight checklist failsafe parameters, the
     aircraft will be programmed to enter Autoland/ RTH mode. In the event of an Autoland/
     RTH the shut-down checklist will be read and the aircraft made safe. Investigations will
     then be made into the failure of the control frequency and the Incident Report will be
     completed . No further flights will take place at that site until a cause and resolution has
     been found.

     Malicious or accidental interference with control frequency

     If the source of the interference cannot be found and stopped, the operation will be
     cancelled .
8.6  Pilot Incapacitation
8.7
8.8  Should the sUAS become incapacitated for any reason the sUAS will activate the return-
     to-home function once the battery reaches a pre-configured warning level. Return-to-
     home mode will give control to the flight controller which will climb the aircraft to a
     predetermined altitude (usually set to 60m) if below that height, or stay at its present
     height, if above 60m. The aircraft will then return to overhead its departure point and wait
     for 30 seconds for further instruction. If none are received, the aircraft will auto-land at its
     departure point and shut-down it's motors. The aircraft will be made safe and appropriate
     help given to the pilot.

     Fly Away Action

     Fly Away's are uncontrolled aircraft flight where no control input from the pilot has any
     effect. A Fly Away is very unlikely but still may occur. If the aircraft does not encounter
     any obstacles, the auto-land feature is likely to be activated when the battery is depleted
     and the aircraft will attempt to land wherever it is. The other possibility is a collision with
     an obstacle or the ground. Should a fly-away occur, the sUAS Operator will note the
     speed and flight direction of the aircraft and inform local Air Traffic Control, if applicable,
     and the local Police Office. A reasonable estimation could be made about the potential
     range of a fly-away from the battery duration remaining and the aircrafts speed. Before
     flight, the sUAS Operator will ensure that the main controller is programmed to limit flight
     to 500m range and 400ft altitude. This may limit the range the sUAS will travel.

     Battery fire

     LiPo batteries in their initial stages (10-15secs) are almost impossible to extinguish. The
     sUAS Operator must have a fire extinguisher on hand to extinguish any secondary fires
     which may occur. All fires will be reported with an Incident Report and to the relevant
     authorities

9.3  Accident Prevention and Flight Safety Programme

     Safety is paramount to Ericsson Caribbean Inc. A constant learning process is employed
     where incidents are noted including their context, in order to prevent repeats. Depending
     on the seriousness of the incident, it may be just recorded in Ericsson Caribbean Inc. own
     incident log. This is for small occurrences, such as minor sUAS Operator errors that could
     have led to damage to Ericsson Caribbean Inc. equipment or compromise the quality of
     the service provided to customers. These minor incidents, however, would pose no risk of
     injury to people or damage to property. More serious events would need to be reported in
     the FAA's and National Transport Safety Board AccidenUincident Information Reporting
     Scheme. http://www.ntsb.gov/ layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx

     Examples of NTSB reportable occurrences would be:

                      · Loss of control/data link

                      · Navigation failures

                      · Any incident that injures a third party

                      · Battery damage or fire

                      · Mechanical failure of the motors

     Information retrieved in this log will be implemented in checklists or flight safety briefings
     in the future to ensure a constant process of improvement.
