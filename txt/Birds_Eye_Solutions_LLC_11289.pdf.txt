                                                          Exemption No. 11289
                                                          Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0944

Mr. David P. Geisler
Manager
Bird's Eye Solutions, LLC
8300 Airport Road, Suite 3
Middleton, WI 53562

Dear Mr. Geisler:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

The Basis for Our Decision

By letter dated November 7, 2014, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
on behalf of Bird's Eye Solutions, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an exemption.
The exemption would allow the petitioner to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial photography, closed-set filming of motion pictures, and scientific data
collection.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.
                                                                                                2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 2.

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection and closed set motion picture and

filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material

respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described

by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of

significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA

good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Bird's Eye Solutions, LLC is granted an exemption
from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a)
and (b), to the extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data
collection and closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to the
conditions and limitations listed below.
                                                                                                 3

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Bird's Eye Solutions, LLC is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 2
    when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any
    other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC must
    be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
                                                                                                            4

    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update or
    revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then the
    operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's UAS
    Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding updates or
    revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g. replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g. inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and aircraft
    components.

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer safety
    bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
                                                                                                            5

    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
    published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a pre-
    determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification (N-
                                                                                                               6

       Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must be
       as large as practicable.

   23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
       any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
       PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating. These
       documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
       official upon request.

   24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
       activities at all times.

   25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

   26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
       persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
          a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
             from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
             that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
             where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
             the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
             of nonparticipating persons; and
          b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
             for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
             the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
             present an undue hazard.

       The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
       nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

   27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
       permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
       Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
       obtained for each flight to be conducted.

   28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
       boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
       to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
       reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
       contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

If this exemption permits operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and
television filming and production, the following additional conditions and limitations apply.
                                                                                                                 7

    29. The operator must have a motion picture and television operations manual (MPTOM)
         as documented in this grant of exemption.

I. PETITION SUMMARY
         Pursuant to Section 333 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012,

Pub. L. No. 112-95 (2012), 126 Stat. 11 ("Section 333") and the Federal Aviation Administration's ("FAA")
general exemption authority under 49 U.S.C. § 44701(f), Bird's Eye Solutions L.L.C. ("Petitioner") hereby
petitions for exemptions from 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113(a) and (b), 61.133(a), 91.7(a),
91.9(b)(2), 91.103(b)(1), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151, 91.203(a) and (b), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1)
91.409(a)(2), 91.417(a)-(b). The proposed exemptions, if granted, would allow Petitioner to operate
small, camera-mounted unmanned aircraft systems ("UAS") weighing 55 pounds or less
for the purpose of closed-set filming of motion pictures, music videos, web videos,
corporate videos, television programs and commercials, and still photography. Additionally the
collection of agriculture and conservation supporting scientific data in FAA approved COE's.

         Based on the small size of Petitioner's UAS, the qualifications and experience of
Petitioner's UAS operators, and the restricted, sterile environment within which
Petitioner will operate, the requested exemptions fall squarely within the zone of safety
envisioned by Congress and set forth in Section 333. Additionally, the enhanced safety
achieved by replacing significantly larger manned aircraft carrying crew and flammable
fuel with small UAS carrying no passengers or crew and operated under the specific
guidelines and procedures proposed by Petitioner gives the FAA good cause to find that
the UAS operations enabled by the instant Petition are in the public interest. Thus, the
requested exemptions should be granted.

                                                               2
II. BACKGROUND
For more than two decades, Petitioner's Operational experience, Unmanned Systems Piloting and
Instructing for the U.S. Army, United States Navy , United States Marines offers a track record of safety
and broad exposure to safe FAA Coordination. In addition to the petitioners UAS Experience the
petitioner has worked extensively with the FAA SmarTopo Obstacle Verification operations. Combining
the latest technology with a long track record of safe and successful projects,
Petitioner seeks regulatory exemptions that will allow Petitioner to employ camera mounted UAS
technology in the filming, production, and scientific data collection for conservation and agriculture
process.
III. STATUTORY AUTHORITY

         A. Section 333
         Section 333, titled "Special Rules for Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems,"
provides a mechanism for seeking expedited FAA authorization of safe civil UAS
operations in the National Airspace System ("NAS"). Section 333(a) states that the FAA
"shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national
airspace system before completion of the [comprehensive] plan and rulemaking required
by section 332(b)(1) of this Act or the guidance required by section 334 of this Act." In Section 332(b)(1),
Congress made it clear that Section 333 provides a mechanism for "expedited operational
authorization." The FAA has committed to complying with this mandate by granting several petitions
almost identical to the one at hand. See, e.g., Exemption No. 11062, Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-
0352 (granting regulatory exemptions to Astraeus Aerial for operation of unmanned aircraft systems for
the purpose of filming for the motion picture and television industry).
         Section 333(b) identifies several factors that the FAA should consider in determining whether
commercial UAS operations should be approved. These include UAS that, "as a result of their size,

                                                               3
weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within
visual line of sight do not create a
hazard to users of the [NAS] or the public or pose a threat to national security." See
Section 333(b).
B. Section 44701(f)
In addition to the specific authority conferred by Section 333, the FAA Administrator has general
authority to grant exemptions from the FAA's safety regulations and minimum standards when the
Administrator decides a requested exemption is in the public interest. See U.S.C. § 44701(f).
IV. REQUESTED EXEMPTIONS

         Petitioner requests relief from the following regulations:
.

         Section 61.113 prescribes that "no person who holds a private pilot certificate
may act as a pilot in command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or
hire; nor may that person, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an aircraft," (see Section
61.113(a)), and that "a private pilot may, for compensation or hire, act as pilot in command of an
aircraft in connection with any business or employment if: (1) The flight is only incidental to that
business or employment; and (2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation
or hire," (see Section 61.113(b)).

         Section 61.133(a) sets forth privileges for persons holding commercial pilot certificates,
including a provision impliedly limiting to persons holding a commercial pilot certificate the
ability to act as pilot in command of an aircraft "[f]or compensation or hire."

         Section 91.103(b)(1) prescribes, in pertinent part, that each pilot in command shall, before
beginning a flight, become familiar with all available information concerning that flight, to
include, "For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended October 1, 2014 use, and the following
takeoff and landing distance information:... For civil aircraft for which an approved Airplane or

                                                               4
Rotorcraft Flight Manual containing takeoff and landing distance data is required, the takeoff and
landing distance data contained therein."

         Section 91.119(c) prescribes that, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may
operate an aircraft below the following altitudes: "Over other than congested areas. An altitude
of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those
cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure."

         Section 91.121 requires, in pertinent part, each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising
altitude by reference to an altimeter that is set "to the elevation of the departure airport or an
appropriate altimeter setting available before departure."

         Section 91.151(a) prescribes that no person may begin a flight in an airplane under
VFR conditions unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is
enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising
speed, (1) during the day, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes; or (2) at night, to fly
after that for at least 45 minutes.

         Section 91.203 prohibits, in subpart (a), any person from operating a civil aircraft
unless it has within it (1) an appropriate and current airworthiness certificate; and (2) an
effective U.S. registration certificate issued to its owner or, for operation within the United States, the
second copy of the Aircraft Registration Application as provided for in October 1,
§ 47.31(c). Section 91.203 prescribes, in subpart (b), that no person may operate a civil
aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate or a special flight authorization issued under §
91.715 is displayed at the cabin or cockpit entrance so that it is legible to passengers or crew.

V. PETITIONER'S PROPOSED OPERATIONS SATISFY SECTION 333.
         A. Unmanned Aircraft System
         The UAS to be operated under this request are less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, will

be operated at a speed of no more than 50 knots, carry neither a pilot nor passenger, carry
no explosive materials or flammable liquids, and operate exclusively within a secured
area. Petitioner's UAS use a radio frequency spectrum for operation and control that
complies with Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") requirements, and
Petitioner has integrated safety features into the UAS, as described in Petitioner's Flight
Operations and Procedures Manual ("FOPM") (collectively, "operations manuals").
Petitioner's UAS are equipped with redundant safety mechanisms allowing them
to operate safely after experiencing certain in-flight failures. If a lost-link event occurs,
including the loss of ground communications and/or the loss of a GPS signal, Petitioner's
UAS have the ability to perform a pre-coordinated, predictable, automated flight
maneuver and return to a predetermined location within a designated security perimeter
for landing. The UAS further have the ability to abort a flight in the event of unpredicted
obstacles or emergencies. All flights will be terminated after a maximum of 30 minutes
or with 25% remaining battery power, whichever occurs first. Thus, good cause exists
for granting Petitioner's requested relief from 14 C.F.R. § 91.151(a) (setting forth fuel
requirements for flight in VFR conditions).

         Petitioner's UAS will be identified by serial number, registered in accordance with
14 C.F.R. Part 47, and have identification (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14
C.F.R. Part 45, Subpart C. Markings will be as large as practicable.

         Regarding Petitioner's requested relief from 14 C.F.R. § 91.121 (Altimeter
Settings), Petitioner seeks such relief because Petitioner will not have a typical
barometric altimeter onboard the UAS. Instead, altitude information will be provided to

                                                               8
the UAS PIC via a digitally encoded telemetric data feed, which downlinks from the
aircraft to a ground-based on-screen display. The altitude information will be generated
by equipment installed onboard the UAS, using GPS triangulation, digitally encoded
barometric altimeter, radio altimeter, or any combination thereof. Prior to each flight, a
zero altitude initiation point will be established and confirmed for accuracy by the UAS
PIC. Thus, good cause exists for granting the requested relief from 14 C.F.R. § 91.121.

         Given the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft to be utilized by the applicant, an exemption from 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H
(Airworthiness Certificates), subject to certain conditions and limitations, is warranted (if
necessary) and meets the requirements for an equivalent level of safety under 14 C.F.R.
Part 11 and Section 333. The UAS operated without an airworthiness certificate in the
restricted environment and under the conditions and limitations proposed by Petitioner
will be at least as safe, or safer, than a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft)
operating with an airworthiness certificate issued under 14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H, and
not subject to the proposed limitations and conditions.

         Petitioner will strictly comply with safety and maintenance procedures included in
all applicable UAS manufacturer's instructions and operating manuals. To the extent
such information is not included in the guidelines developed by the manufacturers,
Petitioners will develop and document maintenance, overhaul, replacement, and
inspection requirements, procedures to document and maintain maintenance records with
regard to Petitioner's UAS, and UAS technician qualification criteria. Petitioner's
operations manuals will include maintenance requirements for Petitioner's UAS,
including "on-condition" maintenance and modifications. In light of these mitigating
factors, exemptions from 14 C.F.R. §§ 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and
91.417(a) and (b) are warranted.

                                                               9
B. UAS Pilot in Command
         Petitioner's UAS pilot in command (PIC) shall have passed the FAA ground

school examination and shall hold at least a third-class medical certificate an be
required to hold a current pilot's license. Since there are no standards for either private
or commercial UAS pilot certificates, knowledge of airspace regulations acquired from
FAA ground school and dexterity in the control and operation of the UAS acquired from
actual operation of the aircraft will be the most important factors in establishing an
equivalent level of safety. According to the FAA, "the FAA considers the overriding
safety factor for the limited operations proposed by the petitioner to be the airmanship
skills acquired through UAS-specific flight cycles, flight time, and specific make and
model experience, culminating in verification through testing." See Exemption No.
11062, Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0352, at p. 18. With those factors in mind,
Petitioner's UAS PIC shall be required to meet several conditions and limitations as
outlined in the FOPM, including the following:

         · The UAS PIC will have accumulated and logged a minimum of 200 flight
                   cycles and 25 hours of total time as a UAS pilot and at least 10
                   hours logged as a UAS pilot with a similar UAS type (single blade or
                   multirotor).

         · The UAS PIC will have accumulated and logged a minimum of five hours
                   of flight time with the specific make and model of the UAS to be utilized
                   for operations under the exemption and three take-offs and landings in the
                   preceding 90 days.

         · The UAS PIC will have successfully completed the qualification process as
                   specified in the operations manuals, to include a knowledge and skill test.

                                                              10
         Regarding Petitioner's requested relief from 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a), it is Petitioner's
understanding that Petitioner's UAS will not require an airworthiness certificate in accordance with
14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart H, and that exemption from 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(a) is therefore unnecessary. To
the extent such an exemption is deemed necessary, Petitioner asserts that it should be granted in light
of the safety procedures proposed herein. In accordance with the pertinent part of 14 C.F.R. § 91.7(b),
the operator in command of Petitioner's UAS shall be responsible for determining whether the aircraft is
in a safe condition for flight. Petitioner's manuals for maintenance and operations shall
include safety checklists to be used by the operator in command prior to each flight.

         Regarding Petitioner's requested relief from 14 C.F.R. § 91.9(b)(2) (Civil aircraft
flight manual, marking, and placard requirements and § 91.203(a) and (b), (Civil aircraft:
certifications required), it is Petitioner's understanding that relief from these regulations
is no longer necessary in light of the FAA Memorandum "Interpretation regarding
whether certain required documents may be kept at an unmanned aircraft's control
station," dated August 8, 2014. To the extent the FAA deems an exemption from this
section necessary for Petitioner's proposed operations, such exemption should be granted
in light of the mitigating fact that Petitioner will maintain the documents required under
14 C.F.R. §§ 91.9 and 91.203 at the UAS ground control station during flights.
Additionally, 100% of Petitioner's operations will utilize a visual observer
("VO"). The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC
always maintains VLOS capability. The VO and the PIC will be able to communicate
verbally at all times during operational flights.
Regarding Petitioner's requested relief from 14 C.F.R. § 91.103(b)(1), Petitioner
will comply with the other applicable procedures and requirements stated in § 91.103(a)
and (b). Specifically, the PIC will take all actions including reviewing weather, flight
battery requirements, aircraft performance data, and landing and takeoff distances before

                                                              11
initiation of a flight. The PIC will also account for all relevant site-specific conditions in
their preflight procedures. Risks presented by sun glare will be mitigated by the PIC's
and VO's ability to see other air traffic and initiate a return-to-home sequence if needed.
C. Operating Parameters of Petitioner's UAS
Petitioner's UAS operations will be conducted within a sterile environment of
closed-set filming. In this controlled environment, Petitioner's operations will remain
within VLOS of the PIC and VO, below 400 feet AGL, and at speeds below 50 knots.
Only participating persons will be permitted within the operating area.
Consistent with the relief typically provided to manned operations under FAA
Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 8, Section 1, Petitioner requests relief from 14 C.F.R.
§ 91.119(c) with respect to those participating persons, vehicles, and structures directly
involved in the performance of the actual filming. Regarding distance from participating
persons, the operations manuals set forth safety factors for authorized and consenting
production personnel. Because those procedures are specific to participating persons, no
further FSDO or aviation safety inspector approval is necessary for reductions to the
distances specified in Petitioner's manuals.
Regarding the distance from nonparticipating persons, Petitioner will ensure that
no persons are allowed within 500 feet of the operating area except those consenting to
be involved and necessary for the filming production, with the possibility of reducing this
distance to no less than 200 feet if it would not adversely affect safety and the
Administrator has approved it. This is consistent with FAA Order 8900.1, V3, C8, S1.

         Petitioner will not conduct UAS operations within 5 nautical miles of the
geographic center of a non-towered airport unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
management is obtained and the operation is conducted in accordance with a Notice to
Airmen ("NOTAM"). Additionally, Petitioner will not operate in Class B, C, or D

                                                              12
airspace without written approval from the FAA. Nor will Petitioner operate the UAS
less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet horizontally from a cloud or when
visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
Petitioner's UAS will remain clear and yield the right of way to all manned
operations and activities at all times (including, but not limited to, ultralight vehicles,
parachute activities, parasailing activities, and hangliders).

         Although Petitioner seeks to comply with the waiver process as described in FAA
Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 8, Section 1 (Issue a Certificate of Waiver for Motion
Picture and Television Filming), the current section of Order 8900.1 has specific
processes that preclude a jurisdictional FAA FSDO from issuing the required Certificate
of Waiver, because the section did not originally provide for UAS operations. Thus,
Petitioner seeks exemption from the applicable regulations normally waived during that
process. Petitioner proposes that the FAA include the required notifications and
coordination with jurisdictional FSDOs through the conditions and limitations
accompanying the requested exemption, and that the exemption sought herein will take
the place of the Certificate of Waiver normally issued by a jurisdictional FSDO under
8900.1. Under this rubric, Petitioner will notify every FSDO with jurisdiction over the
area that Petitioner plans to operate, just as with manned filming operations, and those
FSDOs will have the ability to coordinate further conditions and limitations with the
UAS Integration Office to address any local concerns.

         Petitioner will obtain an Air Traffic Organization ("ATO") issued Certificate of
Waiver or Authorization ("COA") prior to conducting any operations under this grant of
exemption. In fulfilling its requirements under the COA, Petitioner will be required to
request a NOTAM not more than 72 hours in advance, but not less than 48 hours prior to
the operation.

                                                              13
         D. The Requested Exemption Promotes the Public Interest
         The enhanced safety achieved by replacing significantly larger manned aircraft
carrying crew and flammable fuel with small UAS carrying no passengers or crew and
operated under the specific guidelines and procedures proposed by Petitioner gives the
FAA good cause to find that the UAS operations enabled by the instant Petition are in the
public interest. Moreover, as the FAA has already recognized, "UAS provide an
additional tool for the filmmaking industry, Agriculture and Conservation adding a greater degree of
flexibility, which supplements the current capabilities offered by manned aircraft." See Exemption No.
11062, Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2014-0352, at p. 22.
VI. CONCLUSION
         For the foregoing reasons, the regulatory exemptions requested herein should be
granted and Petitioner should be permitted to conduct small UAS operations for the
purpose of closed-set filming.

                                                 Respectfully submitted,
                                                 David P. Geisler

1.1 Built-in Flight Control System Instructions

The built-in flight control system is used to control the entire aircraft's functions in flight such as Pitch (forwards
and backwards), Roll (left and right), Elevator (up and down) and Yaw (turn left or right). The flight controller
contains the MC (Main Controller), IMU, GPS, compass, receiver.
The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has a built-in inertial sensor and a barometric altimeter that measures both
attitude and altitude. The compass reads geomagnetic information which assists the GPS (Global Position System)
to accurately calculate the aircrafts position and height in order to lock the aircraft in a stable hover. The receiver is
used to communicate with the remote controller and the MC acts as the brains of the complete flight control
system connecting and controlling all the modules together.

The PHANTOM 2 can be configured in the Assistant Software, by choosing Naza-M mode or Phantom
 2 mode. This manual is for Phantom 2 mode. Please refer to the Naza-M V2 Quick Start Manual for
 more information.

Important Notes of Using with Other DJI Products

  1 The video cable can provide power for the wireless video transmission module with a battery voltage
          (11.1V~12.6V) and a maximum current 2A.

  2 Make sure the working current of the wireless video transmission module you connect can work with an
          operational voltage between 11.1V~12.6V and the total working current of the iOSD and wireless video
          transmission module is under 2A, as an overcurrent will damage the central board's components. If the
          total current exceeds 2A, please be sure to provide power supplied from a separate power source for the
          wireless video transmission module.

  3 PHANTOM 2 uses a 2.4GHz RC system. To avoid communication interference, it's not recommended to
          use other 2.4GHz devices (including 2.4G wifi or 2.4G wireless video transmission module) except the
          2.4G Bluetooth and 2.4G Datalink.

  4 Be sure to keep the wireless video transmission module and other communicating devices away from the
          compass during installation and connection to avoid interference.

  5 To improve the compatibility with ZENMUSE gimbals, the latest factory deliveries of PHANTOM 2 has
          updated to the Version 2 shown below. H3-2D/H3-3D gimbal can be directly installed for the Version 2
          while for Version 1, a H3-3D adapter kit (coming soon) is required to install the H3-3D gimbal.

     Version 1                                                                                 Version 2

             The remote controller will power off automatically when battery voltage drops below 4V. Land and
             change batteries as soon as possible when the low voltage alert occurs to avoid loss of control during
             flight.

3.3 Antenna Orientation

The remote controller's antenna should point skywards without obstructions for maximum communication range
during flight.

                                                                              Figure 3-3

3.4 Remote Controller Operation

  The operations of remote controller are based on mode 2 stick configuration.

 Definitions

  The `stick neutral' positions and `stick released' mean the control sticks of the remote controller are placed at
  the central position.
  To `move the stick' means that the stick of remote controller is pushed away from the central position.

  Slide Lever is used for the pitch control of the H3-2D and H3-3D gimbal.

                                                  Push the stick up and the aircraft will rise.
                                                  Pull the stick down and the aircraft will descend.
                                                  The aircraft will automatically hover and hold its
                                                  altitude if the sticks are centered.
                                                  Pushing the throttle stick above the centered
                                                  (neutral) position will result in the aircraft taking
                                                  off. We suggest that you push the throttle stick
                                                  slowly to prevent the aircraft from sudden and
                                                  unexpected ascent.

                                                  Increasing movement of the command stick will
                                                  result in a larger tilt angle (maximum is 35°) and

4.5 Correct Battery Usage Notes

  1. Never plug or unplug the battery into the aircraft when it is powered on.
  2. The battery should be charged in an environment that is between 0 to 40, and be discharged in an

      environment that is between -20 to 50. Both charging and discharging should be in an environment
      where the relative humidity is lower than 80%.
  3. It's recommended to charge and discharge the battery thoroughly once every 20 charge/discharge cycles.
      Users should discharge the battery until there is less than 8% power left or until the battery can no longer
      be turned on. Users should then fully recharge the battery to maximum capacity. This power cycling
      procedure will ensure the battery is working at its optimal level.
  4. For long term storage please place the battery with only a 40~50% capacity in a strong battery box
      securely. We recommend discharging and charging the battery completely once every 3 months to keep it
      in good condition. The capacity should be varied in such a cycle (40%~50%)--0%--100%--(40%~50%).
  5. It's suggested you purchase a new battery after you have discharged your current battery over 300 times.
      Please completely discharge a battery prior to disposal.
  6. It's suggested that you purchase a new battery if the current battery is swollen or damaged in any way.
  7. Never try to recharge or fly with a battery that is swollen or damaged in any way.
  8. Never charge the battery unattended. Always charge the battery on a non-flammable surface such as
      concrete and never near any flammable materials.
  9. Safety is extremely important and users can get more information in the DISCLAIMER.

5 Calibrating the Compass

IMPORTANT: Make sure to perform the Compass Calibration procedures prior to the first flight.

The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic interference which causes abnormal compass data and leads to

poor flight performance or even flight failure. Regular calibration of the compass enables the compass to perform at

its optimal level.

5.1 Calibration Warnings

             1 DO NOT calibrate your compass where there is a possibility for the existence of strong

                     magnetic interference such as magnetite, parking structures, and steel reinforcement

                    underground.

       2 DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as keys or cellular
               phones.

       3 Compass Calibration is very important; otherwise the flight control system will work abnormally.

5.2 Calibration Procedures

Please carry out the calibrating procedures in the flight field before flight. Please watch the quick start video of the

PHANTOM 2 for more compass calibration details.

                                                         Flip once

5.3 When Recalibration is Required

1 When Compass Data is abnormal, the LED flight indicator will blink alternating between red and yellow.
2 Last compass calibration was performed at a completely different flying field/location.
3 The mechanical structure of the aircraft has changed, i.e. changed mounting position of the compass.
4 Evident drifting occurs in flight, i.e. the aircraft doesn't fly in straight lines.

6 Flight

6.1 Flying Environment Requirements

          1 Before your first flight, please allow yourself some flight training (Using a flight simulator to
                   practice flying, getting instruction from an experienced person, etc.).

          2 DO NOT fly in bad weather, such as rain or wind (more than moderate breeze) or fog.
          3 The flying field should be open and void of tall buildings or other obstacles; the steel structure

                   within buildings may interfere with the compass.

          4 Keep the aircraft away from obstacles, crowds, power lines, trees, lakes and rivers etc.
          5 Try to avoid interference between the remote controller and other wireless equipment. (No base

                   stations or cell towers around)

          6 The flight control system will not work properly at the South Pole or North Pole.
          7 Never use the aircraft in a manner that infringes upon or contravenes international or domestic

                   lays and regulations.

6.2 Starting the Motors

A Combination Stick Command (CSC) is needed to start the motors. Push the sticks according to one of the options
below to start motors. Once the motors have spun up, release both sticks simultaneously. The same command is
used to stop the motors.

A  BC                                                         D

                                                  Figure 6-1

6.3 Takeoff/Landing Procedures

  1. Start by placing the PHANTOM 2 on the ground with the battery level indicators facing you.
  2. Turn on the remote controller.
  3. Power on the aircraft by turning on the intelligent battery.
  4. When LED flight indicator blinks green/yellow, the PHANTOM 2 is entering Ready to Fly/Ready to Fly

      (non-GPS) mode. Start the motors with the CSC command.
  5. Push the throttle stick up slowly to lift the aircraft off the ground. Refer to <Remote Controller Operation>

      for more details.
  6. Be sure you are hovering over a level surface. Pull down on the throttle stick gently to descend and land.

©2013-2014 DJI Innovations. All Rights Reserved.
  7. After landing the aircraft on the ground, keep the throttle stick at its lowest position for about 3 to 5
      seconds which will automatically stop the motors.

          You SHOULD NOT execute the CSC during normal flight! This will stop the motors and cause the
          aircraft to descend rapidly and drop without any type of control.
          1 When the LED flight indicator blinks yellow rapidly during flight, the aircraft has entered into

                   Failsafe mode, refer to <Failsafe Function> for details.
          2 A low battery capacity warning is indicated by the LED flight indicator blinking red slowly or

                   rapidly during flight. Refer to the <Low Battery Capacity Warning Function> for details.
          3 Watch the quick start video about flight for more flight information.

6.4 Failsafe Function

The aircraft will enter Failsafe mode when the connection from the remote controller is lost. The flight control
system will automatically control the aircraft to return to home and land to reduce injuries or damage. The following
situations would make the aircraft fail to receive a signal from the remote controller and enter Failsafe mode:
1 The remote controller is powered off.
2 The remote controller is powered on but the S1 is toggled in the position triggering the Failsafe (this must

        have been configured in the PHANTOM 2 Assistant Software).
3 The aircraft has flown out of the effective communication range of the remote controller.
4 There is an obstacle obstructing the signal between the remote controller and the aircraft, essentially

        reducing the distance the signal can travel.
5 There is interference causing a signal problem with the remote controller.

Failsafe works differently depending on the mode the aircraft is in when Failsafe mode is initiated whether it is in
the Ready to Fly or Ready to Fly (non-GPS) mode.
Ready to Fly (non-GPS) ---- Automatic landing

  The flight control system will try to keep the aircraft level during descent and landing. Note that the aircraft may
  be drifting during the descent and landing process.

Ready to Fly ---- Automatic go home and land
  The flight control system will automatically control the aircraft to fly back to the home point and land.

Home Point
  When the aircraft is initializing the Ready to Fly status, the aircraft will record the current GPS coordinates as
  the home point. It is recommended to lift off only after Ready to Fly status is confirmed for the safety of being
  able to fly back to home point successfully in case the Failsafe mode is initiated.

1 In a Failsafe situation, if less than 6 GPS satellites are found for more than 20 seconds, the aircraft
        will descend automatically.

In Phantom 2 mode, users can set a new home point manually when the aircraft is in "Ready to fly" status
as long as a home point has been recorded automatically. Quickly flipping the S2 switch of the remote
controller from upper most to lower most positions 5 times or more will reset the current aircraft position
as a new home point of PHANTOM 2. When successfully reset, you will see a series of rapid green blinks
on the LED Flight Indicator. The definition of "home point" is:
1 The home point is the place PHANTOM 2 returns to when the control signal is lost, which is

        recorded last time.
2 The home point is used to calculate the horizontal distance between you and the aircraft, the

        distance will be displayed as D if using iOSD module.

Regaining Control during Failsafe Procedure

Position of                                Position-1                     Position-2                   Position-3
Switch S1                                                                                    (No triggering the Failsafe)

How to regain         When the S1 switch is switched to Position-1,       Regain control as soon as signal is
control               toggle the S1 switch to any other position once to  recovered.
                      regain control. If remote controller's signal is
                      recovered, control is returned back to the pilot.

6.5 Low Battery Capacity Warning Function

The low battery capacity warning alerts users when the battery is close to depletion during flight. When it appears,
users should promptly fly back and land to avoid accidental damage. The PHANTOM 2 has two levels of low battery
capacity warning. The first appears when the battery has less than 30% power and the second appears when it has

©2013-2014 DJI Innovations. All Rights Reserved.
less than 15% power.
1 When battery power drops below 30% and LED indicator will blink red slowly.
2 At lower than 15% the LED indicator will blink red rapidly, the PHANTOM 2 will also begin to descend and

    land automatically. After it has landed, keep the throttle stick at its lowest point or execute CSC.
3 There is a hidden third low battery threshold in addition to the 1st and 2nd level warnings. This uses 10.65V

    as its threshold. Both this voltage threshold and the 2nd Level Low Battery Warning will trigger auto-landing.
    Altitude can be maintained if necessary by pushing up on the throttle stick.

             1 Remember to fly your PHANTOM 2 back as soon as you see a low battery capacity warning.
             2 Keeping the battery contact needles and pads clean is very important. Any dirt and dust may

                      cause a communication failure.

6.6 Flight Limits Function

All UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators should abide by all regulations from such organizations at ICAO
(International Civil Aviation Organization) and per country airspace regulations. For safety reasons, the flight limits
function is enabled by default to help users use this product safely and legally. The flight limits function includes
height, distance limits.
In Ready to Fly status, height, distance limits works together to restrict the flight. In Ready to Fly (non-GPS) status,
only height limit works and the flying height restricted to be not over 120m.

             (1) The default parameters in the Assistant Software is compliant within the definitions of class G
                      ruled by ICAO. (Refer to Airspace Classification to get more details). As each country has its
                      own rules, make sure to configure the parameters to comply with these rules too, before using
                      the PHANTOM 2.

             (2) Users in Mainland China can refer to .
Max Height & Radius Limits
The Max Height & Radius restricts the flying height and distance. Configuration can be done in the PHANTOM 2
Assistant. Once complete, your aircraft will fly in a restricted cylinder.
