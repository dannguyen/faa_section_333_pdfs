                                                      Exemption No. 11440A
                                                      Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0168

Rupprecht Law, P.A.
Counsel for Wild Rabbit Productions LLC
324 Datura Street, Suite 200
West Palm Beach, FL 33401

Dear Mr. Rupprecht:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your petition for an amendment. It explains
the basis for our decision, describes its effect, and lists any changes to the original conditions
and limitations.

By letter dated May 21, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on
behalf of Wild Rabbit Productions, LLC (hereinafter petitioner or operator) for an amendment
to your current exemption. That exemption from §§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5),
61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1),
91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b) of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)
allows the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection and closed-set motion
picture and television filming. You requested an amendment to add the DJI S1000+ and DJI
S1000 Premium.

In your petition, you indicate that there has been no change in the conditions and reasons
relative to public interest and safety that were the basis for granting the original exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested amendment to the exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner. The
unmanned aircraft(s) authorized in the original grant are comparable in type, size, weight,
speed and operating capabilities to those in this petition.

Airworthiness Certification

In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in
reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited
                                                                                                                  2

operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation
has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA
finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts,
Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing
requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

Our Decision

The FAA has determined that the justification for the issuance of Exemption No. 11440
remains valid and is in the public interest. Therefore, under the authority contained
in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701, delegated to me by the Administrator, the operator is
granted an amendment to add new aircraft to its UAS operations.

The operator shall add this amendment to its original exemption.

Conditions and Limitations

All conditions and limitations within Grant of Exemption No. 11440 remain in effect except
as follows. Condition No. 1 has been updated to reflect the additional aircraft.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

    1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the Allied Drones
         Chaos X-8, DJI S1000 +, and DJI S1000 Premium when weighing less than
         55 pounds including payload. Proposed operations of any other aircraft will require a
         new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.

This exemption terminates on April 30, 2017, unless sooner superseded or rescinded.

Sincerely,

/s/

         Re: Petition for Amendment to Add Aircraft to Exemption # 11440 Issued to Wild Rabbit
         Productions, LLC. (Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0168)
Dear Sir or Madam:

         Wild Rabbit Productions, LLC was granted an exemption to conduct aerial data collection and
closed set TV/movie filming using an Allied Drones Chaos X-8. Wild Rabbit Productions, LLC
(Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-0168) requests for an amendment to that exemption to add onto its
fleet the DJI S1000+ and the DJI S1000 Premium. Wild Rabbit Productions, LLC agrees to operate
under the same restrictions in the exemption. We will submit the manuals confidentially via email.

         Granting the additional aircraft will benefit the public because instead of dangerous helicopters
being used, safer and quieter unmanned aircraft can be used under the restrictions outlined in the
exemption.

         Since the S1000 platform has been previously granted in other exemptions and would not set any
precedent, there is good cause to waive the publishing of this petition in the Federal Register.

Sincerely,
