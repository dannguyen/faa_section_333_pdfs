                                                           Exemption No. 12489
                                                           Regulatory Docket No. FAA­2015-1404

Mr. Ruben E Carlos
16450 King Avenue
Riverside, CA 92504

Dear Mr. Carlos:

This letter is to inform you that we have granted your request for exemption. It transmits our
decision, explains its basis, and gives you the conditions and limitations of the exemption,
including the date it ends.

By letter dated April 22, 2015, you petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for
an exemption. The petitioner requested to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to
conduct aerial photography, videography, closed-set motion picture filming, survey, news
gathering, inspections, and training1.

See Appendix A for the petition submitted to the FAA describing the proposed operations and
the regulations that the petitioner seeks an exemption.

The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the petition
in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a precedent, and any
delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to the petitioner.

1 The petitioner also requested authority to conduct UAS training. At this time, the FAA is unable to authorize
UAS operations for training until a further assessment is completed. When the FAA completes its review, we
will proceed accordingly and no further action will be required by the petitioner. However, the petitioner is
permitted to train its own pilot in commands and visual observers in accordance with condition no. 14 and the
other conditions and limitations in this exemption.
                                                                                                                 2

Airworthiness Certification

The UAS proposed by the petitioner is a DJI Phantom 3 Professional.

The petitioner requested relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products
and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness Certificates. In accordance with the statutory criteria
provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112-95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. § 44704, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the
aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft
meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that the requested relief from
14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H--Airworthiness
Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is
not necessary.

The Basis for Our Decision

You have requested to use a UAS for aerial data collection2 and closed set motion picture and
filming. The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material
respects to those presented in your petition. In Grants of Exemption Nos. 11062 to Astraeus
Aerial (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0352), 11109 to Clayco, Inc. (see Docket No.
FAA-2014-0507), 11112 to VDOS Global, LLC (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0382), and
11213 to Aeryon Labs, Inc. (see Docket No. FAA-2014-0642), the FAA found that the
enhanced safety achieved using an unmanned aircraft (UA) with the specifications described
by the petitioner and carrying no passengers or crew, rather than a manned aircraft of
significantly greater proportions, carrying crew in addition to flammable fuel, gives the FAA
good cause to find that the UAS operation enabled by this exemption is in the public interest.

Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that--

· They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
    Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and 11213;

· The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 11062, 11109, 11112, and
    11213 also apply to the situation you present; and

· A grant of exemption is in the public interest.

2 Aerial data collection includes any remote sensing and measuring by an instrument(s) aboard the UA.
Examples include imagery (photography, video, infrared, etc.), electronic measurement (precision surveying, RF
analysis, etc.), chemical measurement (particulate measurement, etc.), or any other gathering of data by
instruments aboard the UA.
                                                                                              3

Our Decision

In consideration of the foregoing, I find that a grant of exemption is in the public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. 106(f), 40113, and 44701,
delegated to me by the Administrator, Ruben E. Carlos is granted an exemption from 14 CFR
§§ 61.23(a) and (c), 61.101(e)(4) and (5), 61.113(a), 61.315(a), 91.7(a), 91.119(c), 91.121,
91.151(a)(1), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1) and (2), and 91.417(a) and (b), to the
extent necessary to allow the petitioner to operate a UAS to perform aerial data collection and
closed set motion picture and filming. This exemption is subject to the conditions and
limitations listed below.

Conditions and Limitations

In this grant of exemption, Ruben E. Carlos is hereafter referred to as the operator.

Failure to comply with any of the conditions and limitations of this grant of exemption will be
grounds for the immediate suspension or rescission of this exemption.

1. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption are limited to the DJI Phantom 3
    Professional when weighing less than 55 pounds including payload. Proposed
    operations of any other aircraft will require a new petition or a petition to amend this
    exemption.

2. Operations for the purpose of closed-set motion picture and television filming are
    permitted.

3. The UA may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour). The
    exemption holder may use either groundspeed or calibrated airspeed to determine
    compliance with the 87 knot speed restriction. In no case will the UA be operated at
    airspeeds greater than the maximum UA operating airspeed recommended by the
    aircraft manufacturer.

4. The UA must be operated at an altitude of no more than 400 feet above ground level
    (AGL). Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.

5. The UA must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times.
    This requires the PIC to be able to use human vision unaided by any device other than
    corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC's FAA-issued airman medical certificate or
    U.S. driver's license.

6. All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO). The UA must be operated within
    the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC and VO at all times. The VO may be used
    to satisfy the VLOS requirement as long as the PIC always maintains VLOS
    capability. The VO and PIC must be able to communicate verbally at all times;
                                                                                                            4

    electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. The PIC
    must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer his or her designation for the
    duration of the flight. The PIC must ensure that the VO can perform the duties
    required of the VO.

7. This exemption and all documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its
    operations in accordance with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of
    exemption, are hereinafter referred to as the operating documents. The operating
    documents must be accessible during UAS operations and made available to the
    Administrator upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and
    limitations in this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents,
    the conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed.
    Otherwise, the operator must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
    documents. The operator may update or revise its operating documents. It is the
    operator's responsibility to track such revisions and present updated and revised
    documents to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request. The
    operator must also present updated and revised documents if it petitions for extension
    or amendment to this grant of exemption. If the operator determines that any update
    or revision would affect the basis upon which the FAA granted this exemption, then
    the operator must petition for an amendment to its grant of exemption. The FAA's
    UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) may be contacted if questions arise regarding
    updates or revisions to the operating documents.

8. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS operation
    or flight characteristics, e.g., replacement of a flight critical component, must undergo
    a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this exemption.
    Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO and must remain at
    least 500 feet from other people. The functional test flight must be conducted in such
    a manner so as to not pose an undue hazard to persons and property.

9. The operator is responsible for maintaining and inspecting the UAS to ensure that it is
    in a condition for safe operation.

10. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
    UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
    potential discrepancies, e.g., inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
    inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed and the
    UAS is found to be in a condition for safe flight.

11. The operator must follow the UAS manufacturer's maintenance, overhaul,
    replacement, inspection, and life limit requirements for the aircraft and
    aircraft components.
                                                                                              5

12. Each UAS operated under this exemption must comply with all manufacturer
    safety bulletins.

13. Under this grant of exemption, a PIC must hold either an airline transport,
    commercial, private, recreational, or sport pilot certificate. The PIC must also hold a
    current FAA airman medical certificate or a valid U.S. driver's license issued by a
    state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, a territory, a possession, or the Federal
    government. The PIC must also meet the flight review requirements specified in
    14 CFR § 61.56 in an aircraft in which the PIC is rated on his or her pilot certificate.

14. The operator may not permit any PIC to operate unless the PIC demonstrates the
    ability to safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be
    operated under this exemption, including evasive and emergency maneuvers and
    maintaining appropriate distances from persons, vessels, vehicles and structures. PIC
    qualification flight hours and currency must be logged in a manner consistent with
    14 CFR § 61.51(b). Flights for the purposes of training the operator's PICs and VOs
    (training, proficiency, and experience-building) and determining the PIC's ability to
    safely operate the UAS in a manner consistent with how the UAS will be operated
    under this exemption are permitted under the terms of this exemption. However,
    training operations may only be conducted during dedicated training sessions. During
    training, proficiency, and experience-building flights, all persons not essential for
    flight operations are considered nonparticipants, and the PIC must operate the UA
    with appropriate distance from nonparticipants in accordance with 14 CFR § 91.119.

15. UAS operations may not be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
    operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Flights
    under special visual flight rules (SVFR) are not authorized.

16. The UA may not operate within 5 nautical miles of an airport reference point (ARP) as
    denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facility Directory (AFD) or for airports not
    denoted with an ARP, the center of the airport symbol as denoted on the current
    FAA-published aeronautical chart, unless a letter of agreement with that airport's
    management is obtained or otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption
    holder. The letter of agreement with the airport management must be made available
    to the Administrator or any law enforcement official upon request.

17. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
    horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.

18. If the UAS loses communications or loses its GPS signal, the UA must return to a
    pre-determined location within the private or controlled-access property.

19. The PIC must abort the flight in the event of unpredicted obstacles or emergencies.
                                                                                                            6

20. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
    weather conditions) there is enough available power for the UA to conduct the
    intended operation and to operate after that for at least five minutes or with the reserve
    power recommended by the manufacturer if greater.

21. Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). All
    operations shall be conducted in accordance with an ATO-issued COA. The
    exemption holder may apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct
    operations that cannot be conducted under the terms of the attached COA.

22. All aircraft operated in accordance with this exemption must be identified by serial
    number, registered in accordance with 14 CFR part 47, and have identification
    (N-Number) markings in accordance with 14 CFR part 45, Subpart C. Markings must
    be as large as practicable.

23. Documents used by the operator to ensure the safe operation and flight of the UAS and
    any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9 and 91.203 must be available to the
    PIC at the Ground Control Station of the UAS any time the aircraft is operating.
    These documents must be made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
    official upon request.

24. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
    activities at all times.

25. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device or vehicle.

26. All Flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all nonparticipating
    persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless:
      a. Barriers or structures are present that sufficiently protect nonparticipating persons
          from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure
          that nonparticipating persons remain under such protection. If a situation arises
          where nonparticipating persons leave such protection and are within 500 feet of
          the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety
          of nonparticipating persons; and
      b. The owner/controller of any vessels, vehicles or structures has granted permission
          for operating closer to those objects and the PIC has made a safety assessment of
          the risk of operating closer to those objects and determined that it does not
          present an undue hazard.

    The PIC, VO, operator trainees or essential persons are not considered
    nonparticipating persons under this exemption.

27. All operations shall be conducted over private or controlled-access property with
    permission from the property owner/controller or authorized representative.
                                                                                               7

Permission from property owner/controller or authorized representative will be
obtained for each flight to be conducted.

28. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
    boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported
    to the FAA's UAS Integration Office (AFS-80) within 24 hours. Accidents must be
    reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) per instructions
    contained on the NTSB Web site: www.ntsb.gov.

14 C.F.R. Part 21, Subpart i-t: Airworthiness Certificates 14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) (1)

Subpart H, entitled Airworthiness Certificates, establishes the procedural requirements fot the issuance

of Airworthiness certificates as required by FAR §91.203 (a) (1). Given the size and limited operating

area associated with the aircraft to be utilized by the Applicant, an exemption from Part 21 Subpart H
meets the requirements of an equivalent level of safety under Part 11 and section 333 of the Reform
Act. ihe Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C§44701 {f)) and Section 333 of the Reform Act both authorize the
FAA to exempt aircraft from the requirement for an airworthiness certificatQ, upon considera.tton of the
size, weight, speedJ operational capability, and proximity to airports and populated areas of the
particular sUASs. In all cases, an analysis of these criteria demonstrates that the sUASs operated without
an airworthiness certificate, in the restricted environment and under the conditions proposed will be at
least safe, or safer, that a conventional aircraft (fixed wing or rotorcraft) operating with an airworthiness
certificate without the restrictions and conditions proposed.

The sUASs to be operated hereunder Is less than 55 lbs. fully loaded, carries neither a pilot nor

passenger, carries no explosive material or flammable liquid fuels, and operates exdus1vely within a

secured and designated area. Unlike other civil aircraft, operations under this exemption will be tightly
controlled ~md monitored by both the operator and under the requirements and in compliance with
local public safety requirements. The FAA will have advanced notice of all operations. These safety
enhancements provide a greater degree of safety to the public and property owners than conventional
operations conducted with airworthiness certificates issued under 14 C,F.R. Part 211 Subpart H. Lastly,

application of these same criteria demonstrates that there Is no credible threat to national security

posed by the sUASS1 due to its size, speed of operation, location of operation, lack of explosive materials
or flammable liquid fuels, and Inability to carry a substantial external load.

14 C.F.R. § 45.23 (b). Marking of tha Alrc:raft

The regulation requires:
When marks include only the Roman capitol letter "N" and the registration number is displayed on
limited, restricted or light-sport category aircraft or experimental ot provisionally certificated aircraft,
the operator must also display on that aircraft near each entrance to the cabin, cockpit, or pilot station,
in letters not less than 2 inches nor more than 11 Inches high, the words "limited/' "restricted," "light·
sport,'1 11experimenta1,'1 or Provisional,'' as applicable.

Even though the sUASs will have no airworthiness certificate, an exemption may be needed as the sUASs
will have no entrance to the cabin, cockpit or pilot station on which the word "Experimental" will be

placed 011 the fuselae;e In eomplianee with §45.29 (f).

The equivalent level of safety will be provided by having the sUASs marked oh Its fuselage as required by
§45.29 (f) where the pilot, observer and others working with the sUASs will see the identification of the
sUASs as ''Experimental." The FAA has issuad the following exemptions to this regulation to Exemptions
Nos. 10700, S73Sf 10167, and l0167A.

14 C.F.R. § 61.113 (a) & (b): Private pilot Privlleges and limitations: Pilot 1n Command.

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. 61.113 (a) & (b), no person who holds ill private pilot certificate may act as a pilot
In command of an aircraft that is carrying passengers or property for compensation or hire. Our sUASs
do not carry any pilots or passengers nor property therefore I am seeking an exemption to 14 C.F.R.
61.113 (a) & (b). Although helpful, a pilot's license will not ensure remote control piloting skills. Unlike
conventional aircraft that carries a pilot and passengers, the .sUASs ls remotely controlled with no
persons onboard. The area of operation is controlled and restricted; and all flights are planned and
coordinated in advance. the risks associated with th9 operation of the sUAS~ are so dirninl5hed from the
level of risk associated with commercial operations contemplated by Part 61 when drafted, that allowing
operations as requested with a skilled PIC in the ground crew exceeds the present level of safety
achieved by 14 C.F.R. §31.113 (a) & {b).

14 C.F.R. § 91.7 (a): Civil aircraft Airworthiness.

The tegulation requires that non person may operate a civil aircraft unless It Is in airworthy condition. As
there will be no airworthiness certificate issued for the aircraft}' should this exemption be granted}' no
FAA regulatory standard will exist for a determining airworthiness. Given the size of the aircraft for
maintenance and use of safety check lists prior to each flight and equivalent level of safety will be
provided.

14 C.F.R. § 91.9 (b) (2): Civil Airc:raft Fllght M~nu~lln the Aln:;rah.

Section 91.9 (b) (2) provides: No person may operate a u.s.-registered civil aircraft... (2) For whlch an
Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual is not required by §21.5 of this chapter, unless there is available in
the aircraft a current and approved airplane or rotorcraft flight manual, approved manual material,
markings, and placards, or any combination thereof. The sUASs, given its size and configuration has no
ability or place to carry such a flight manual on the aircraft}' not only because there is no pilot on board;
but because there is no room or capacity to carry such an Item on the aircraft. The equivalent level of
safety will be maintained by keeping the flight manual at the ground control polnt where the pilot flying
the sUASs will have immediate access to it. The FAA has issued the following exemptions to this
regulation: Exemption Nos. 8807, 8737, 8738, 9299, 9299A, 9565; 95658, 10167, 10602, 32827; and
10700

14 C.F.R. § 91.103: Preflight Action.

This regulation requires each PIC to take certain actions before flight to insure the safety of flight. As
FAA approved rotorcraft flight manuals will not be provided for the aircraft an exemption will be
needed. The PIC will take all actions including reviewing weather, flight battery requirements, landing
and takeoff distances, ahd aircraft performance data before initiation offllght. Further, we have
proprietary manuals created with the help of sUASs experts, the manufactures, and the regional sUAS
vendor, and continue to work with these organizations to ensure best safe practices are adhered to.

14 C.F.R. § 91.109: Flight Instruction.

Section 91.103 provides that no per~on may operate a civil aircraft (except manned free balloon) that is

being used for flight instruction unless that aircraft has fully functioning dual controls. sUASs and
remotely piloted aircraft, by their design do not have fully functional dual controls. Flight control is

accomplished through the use of a control box that communicates with the aircraft via radio
communications. The FAA has approved exemptions for flight training without fully functional dual

controls for a number of aircraft and for flight instruction in experimental aircraft. See Exemption Nos.
5778K & 9862A. The equivalent level of .safety provided by th~ fact that neither a pilot nor passenger
will be carried In the aircraft and by the size and speed of the aircraft.

14 C.F.R. § 91.119: Minimum safe Altitudes.

Section 91.119 establishes safe altitudes for operation of civil aircraft. Section 91.119 (d) allows
helicopters to be operated at less than the minimums prescribed, provided the person operating the

helicopter complies with any route or altitudes prescribed for helicopters by the FM. As this exemption
Is for a sUASs that is a helicopter and the exemption requests authority to operate at altitudes up to 400

AGL, or not more than 200 above an elevated platform from which filming Is planned, an exemption
may be needed to allow such operations. As set forth herein, the sUASs is used to survey or photograph
a structure whose height exceeds 400 feet AGL, the sUASs will not be operated more than 100 feet
above the highest point ofthe structure. It will however be oper;;3ted In a restricted area with a security

perimeter; where buildings and people will not be exposed to operations without thc~lif pte,obtalned

consent.

The equivalent level of safety will be achieved given the size, weight, speed of the sUASs as well as the
location where it ls to be opetated. No flight will be taken without the permission of the property owner
or local officials. Because of the advance notice to the property owner and participants in the filming
activity, all affected Individuals will be aware of the planned flight operations, Compared to flight
operations with aircraft or rotorcraft weighing far more than the maximum 55 lbs. proposed herein and
the lack of flammable fuel; any risk associated with these operations Is far less than those presently

presented with conventional aircraft operating at or below soo AGL. In addition, the low-altitude

operation of the sUASs will ensure separation between these small~ UAS operations and the operations
of conventional aircraft that must cornply with Section 91.119.

14 C.F.R. § 91.121: Altimeter Settings.

Section 91.121 requires each person operating an aircraft to maintain cruising altitude by reference to

al'l altimeter that is set"·-- to the elevation ofthe departure airport or an appropriate altimeter setting
available before departure." As the sUASs may not have a barometric altimeter, but instead a GPS

altitude read out, an exemption may be needed. An equivalent level of safety wW be achieved by the

operator, confirming the altitude of the launch site shown on the GPS altitude indicator before flight.
The PIC and technician will also ensure effective pairing with multiple GPS sources to guarantee accurate
detection of height,

14 C.F.R. § 91.151 (a): Fuel Requirements for Flight: In VFR Conditions

Section 91.151 (a) prohibits an Individual from beginning ua flight in an airplane under VFR conditions

unless (considering wind and forecast weather conditions) there is enough fuel to fly to the first point of
intended landing, and, assuming normal cruising speed~ {1) During the day, to fly after thi\'lt for at least
30 minutes; or (2} At night1 to fly after that for at least 45 minutes.

The battery powering the sUASs provides approximately 30 minutes of powered fUght in hover mode
without payload. The applleal"'tS sUAS!: will not bE! abl@ to meat the 30 minute reserve reqt.~irement in 14
C.F.R §91.151. Given the limitations on the sUASs proposed flight area and the location of its proposed

operations within a predetermined area, a longer flight time frame for flight In daylight or twilight VFR

conditions is reasonable. Operating the sUASs, in a tightly controlled area where only people and
property owners or official representatives who have slgned waivers will be allowed, with less than 30
minute of reserve power1 does not engender the type of risks that Section 91.151 (a} was intended to
alleviate given the slze and speed of the small UAS.

Applicant believes that an equivalent level of safety can be achieved by limltfng flights to 30 minutes or
25% of battery power whichever comes first. This restriction would be more than adequate to return

the sUASs to its planned landing zone from anywhere in its limlte!d operating area.

Similar exemptions have been granted to other operations, including Exemptions 2689f, 5745, 10673,
and 10808.

14 C.F.R. § 91.203 (a) and (b): Carrying Civil Aircraft Certification and Registration

The regulation provides in pertinent part:

          {a) Except as provided in §91. 715, no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it has within it
               the following:
                    (1) An appropriate and current airworthiness certificate...

          (b) No person may operate a civil aircraft unless the airworthiness certificate required by
               paragraph (a) ofthls section to a special flight authorization issued under §91.715 is
               displayed at the cabin or cockpit antranee so that it is legible to pessenge!rs and crew.

The sUASs fully !()aded weighs no more than SSibs and is operated without an onboard pilot. As such,
there is no ability or place to carry certification and registration documents or to display them on the
sUAS.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved by keeping these documents at the ground control point
where the pilot flying the sUASs will have immediate access to them; to the extent they are applicable to
the sUASs. ihe j;:M has Issued numerous exemptions to this regulation. A representative sample of
other exemp~ions includes. Exemption Nos. 9565. 9E.i6S, 97~91 51789A, 97971 9797A, 9816A~ and 10700.

14 C.F.R. § 91.405 (a); 407 (a)(t); 409 (a)(2); 417 (a) & (b): Maintenance inspections

These regulations require that an aircr~ft opt!!rator or owner ''shall have that aircraft inspected as
prescribed in subpart Eof this chapter and shall between required inspections} except as provided in
paragraph (c) of this section, have discrepancies repaired as prescribed in part 43 of this chapter..." and
others shall inspect or maintain the aircraft in compliance with Part 43.

Given that these section and Part 43 apply only to aircraft with an airworthiness certificate, these
sections will not aJ.')ply to the applicant. Maintenance will be accomt:Jiished by the operator pursuant to
the f!lght manual, operating handbook and maintenance handbook. An equivalent level of safety will be
achieved because these small UASs are very limited in size and will carry a small payload and operated
only in restricted areas for limited periods of time.'lf mechanical issues arise the sUASs can land
Immediately and will be operating from no higher than 400 feet AGL. The operator will ensure that the

maintenance performed. Moreover, the operator is the person most familiar with the aircraft and best
suited to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition to provide the equivalent level of safety.

An equivalent level of safety will be achieved because maintenance and inspections will be performed in
accordance with the sUASs Manufacturer's Manual1 as referenced in the Aircraft Operations Manual
(AOM). As provided in the FOM, the operator will ensure that the sUASs is in working order prior to
initiating flight and perform required maintenance needed.

Pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Part 11J the following summary is provided for the publication in the Federal
Register, should it be determined that publication Is needed:

          Appllcant seeks an exemption from the following rules:

          14 C.F.R. §21, subpart Hi 14 C.F.R. 45.23(b}; 14 C.F.R. §§ 61.113(a) & (b)i 91.7(a); 91.9(b)(2);

91.417(a) & (b) to operate commercially a small unmanned vehicle (55 lbs. or less) in motion picture and
television operations, as well as in the public and private sector.

Approval of exemptions allowing commercial operations of sUASs lh the film industry will enhance
safety by reducing risk. Conventional film operations, using jet or piston powered aircraft operate at
extrem@ly low altitudes just feet from the subject being filmed and in @xtreme proximity to people .and
structures; and present the risks associated With vehicles that weigh in the neighborhood of 4JOOO lbs.,
carrying large amounts of Jet A or other fuel. (140 gallons for the jet helicopter shown below.) Such
aircraft must fly to and from the film location. In contrast, a sUASs weighing fewer than 55 lbs. and
powered by batteries eliminates virtually all of that risk given the reduced mass and lack of combustible
fuel carried onboard. The sUASs is carried to the film set and not flown. The sUASs will carry no

passengers or crew and, therefore, will not expose them to the risks associated with manned aircraft
flights.

the operation of small UASs, weighing less than 55 lbs., conducted in the strict <:onditions outlined
above, will provide and equivalent level of safety supporting the grant of the exemptions requested

herein1 including exempting the applicant from requirements of Part 21 and arlowing commercial
operations. Th~se lightweight aircraft operate at slow speeds, dose to the ground and in sterile
environment and, as a result, are far safer than conventional operations conducted with turbihe or
piston Powered hetieopters operating In close proximity to the ground <~nd people.

Privacy

All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's or official
representative's prior consent and knowledge. Filming will be of the people who have also consented to
being fllm~d or otherwlse have agreed to be In the area where filming will take place.

Commercial and Public Benefits

The applicant believes that granting this exemption request furthers the public interest by providing safe
(by the way of unmanned system) and efficient means to meet technical problems solvable by elevated
data cQIIectlon Instruments. The applicants client base are typic;ally small to medium si:z;ed business' and
realtors looking to increase thelr awareness of structures or landscape on their respective properties
through data collection by photographic, video graphi<::, or LIDAR based surveying. By moving these
subjects onto sUASs based aircraft} the potential for loss of life or property is diminished due to the
greater control in a smaller and safer aircraft that holds no pilot, crew, or passengers. Second, there are
no reactive or combustible materials on board the sUASs and thus the potential for fire or explosion is
greatly diminished. Third, the small size and extreme maneuverabtllty of the applicant's sUASs allow the
PJC to avoid hazards. Lastly due to the nature of the remote sensing instrumentation onboard, the sUASs
can maintain quite a safe distance between the aircraft and the object(s) undergoing scrutiny.
Accordingly, the Applicants sUASs have operated and will continue to operate at and above current

safety levels.

The effect of an exemption for the appUcant on the quality of the natural ancl social environments

Utilizing sUASs mlnlmh:es the requirement for c::onventional aircraft. This eliminates the need for an
onboard pilot1 Time consuming adherence to regulations surrounding book keeping and submission of
flight paths to local civil or military airports, and detrimental effects to the environment caused by
operating a combustible fuel_ large scale aircraft, with restrictions on the proximity to the target for
remote sensing, photography or videography.

Flight Capabilities and Characteristics of the Applicants UASs

Pursuant to 112 P.l. 95 §333 (a), concerns for public:: safety are mitigated by the overall capabilities and

characteristics of the sUASs.*

The Applicant's UASs utilizes four (4) counter-rotating propellers paired oppositely to each other for
balance, control and stability. The total span of the sUASs Is:;,: 590mm including propellers, allowing for
stable flight or landing even with the sudden onset of detrimental environmental conditions. The sUASs
maximum weight (including batt~ry. propellers) of 1.3 Kg_ ihe applicant's sUASs is designed t~W> hQver in

place to capture photographic data and then operate at less than 50 knot maximum speed to the next

point of Interest. They are capable of vertical and horizontal operations hut. in practice, is operated only
within unaided VLOS of the PIC. In addition to the PIC; the Applicant employs a spotter (VOS role) and a

technician (secondary VOS and on~site personnel liaison) which are within verbal communication range.

These personnel are supplemented by safety officials provided by the client who are instructed to
cordon off and otherwise minimize pedestrian access in the flight zone of the dient;s grounds. In the
event of loss of visual of the UAS1 the PIC can change the flight controls from Cartesian (X,Y,Z.) based
controls to radial (r,a,h) based control$ which allows the PIC to utilize one controller axis to recall the
UAS to the PIC's position without concern to the current heading of the sUASs. The sUASs also have a

Return-to~Home feature that will allow the UAS to return to the PIC's location in the case of the UAS

losing signal to the PIC, or If the PIC initiates the Return-to~Home procedure. In the event of loss of sight
of the sUASs Into ;:~n area containing hazards or possible hazards, the spotter has a heads-up-display
containing a live video feed which can b~ used to locate the UAS while it maintains its position hover
mode. The sUASs has d~monstrated its ability to maintain its position by GPS, SONAR, and Optkal flow
camera with an accuracy of+/~ 10cm vertical and+/~ 1m horizontal.

All of the applicant's sUASs utilize liPo (lithium polymer) battery based power sources, decreasing safety

risks from more easily combustible, fuel based, power sources. Flight times generally last between eight

(8) to ten {10} minutes allowing the staff to work with small areas per phase. The maximum flight time

without payload is approximately 25 minutes; however practical safe operation limits this to 15 minutes

to give ample time to control the sUASs to a :!iafe lahding wne. 'fhe applicant further restricts flight time

by to operating the sUASs with less than twenty five percent (25%) battery capacity.

Reasons Why an Exemption to the Applicant Will Not Adversely Affect Safety Standards

The Applicant contends that operation of its sUASs will not ·"create a hazard to users of the national

airspace system or the public." As stated rn 112 P.l. 95 § 333(b). Given the diminutive size and weight of

the sUASs, combined with their operation in cordoned off and well-controlled areas. The applicant's
sUASs falls within congress's contemplated safety 11:one. The applicant's sUASs have an established
safety record bolstered by multi-point preflight checklists, awareness of their surroundings and intimate
knowledge and behavior of the sUASs platform In many weather conditions. This safety record and
implemented operational practices demonstrates an awarene~s of public safety.

The Applicant's operations routloely provide:! a level of safety at le~st equal to existing rules1 and in
nearly every instance, exceeds existing rules. The applicant's sUASs does not and cannot operate on or
near airports and generally has only operated its fleet on private grounds with cordoned off areas or
areas under the control of the property owner/ client with assistance by safety officials employed by the
business. The applicant determines the areas needed to fulfill the clien'l!s goals and only operates its

Fly Safe

DJI encourages you to ~mjoy flying your Phantom 3 Professional in a safe, responsible, and amart way. To clo tills, It Is Important to
understand some basic flight guidelines, both for your protection and for the safety Of tl1oae around you.

1. Fly in Opan Areas: Always fly In locations that are free and clear of buildings, trees, power lines, and other obstacles. Do not flY above
   or near people or animals.

2. Maintain Control at All Times: Even when using DJI autopilot functions such as Auto-Takeoff, Auto-L9.nding, and Auto-Return to
   Home, alway$ k*P your handa on the Remote Controller anel maintain control of your 9lrcraft when it is in ffight.

3. Maintain Un~ Qf Sight: Kl;lSp your aircraft in 8ight at ell times, and avoid tly1ng behind buildings or other obstacles that ma'y block your v1e'v\l,

4. Monitor Your Altitude: For the safety of full-si<:ed alroraft and other air traffic, always fly at altitudes less than 400 feet (i 20 meters)
   above ground Javel, or In line with your local laws and regulatione.

Via~ http://flysa.fe.dji.com/no-fly for more Information on cr~lcal safety features such as
No-Ry Zones.

· Calibrating the Compass:

Me.ke sure to calibrate the compass at every new flight location. The compass is very sensitive to electromagnetic Interference, which
~n cause abnormal compass data, leading to poor illght performance or even fallure. Regular calibration is required for optimal

performance.
1. DO NOT calibrate your compass where there Is a chance of strong magnetic in1erference, such as magnettte, parking structures, and

   steel reinforcements underground.
2. DO NOT carry ferromagnetic materials with you during calibration such as Keys or cellular phones.

a. DO NOT calibre!;$ be$ide maeeive metal objects.

4. If the Aircraft Status Indicators are showing soUd red, than try to calibrate again. If they are blinking red and yellow alternately after
   placing tM aircraft on tha ground, the compass has detected m9gnetlc Interference. Change your location.

· Environmental Considerations:

1. Do not ffy in severe we~ther condition~. Thi::; indud$$ high wind::; (:speeds of 22 mph or 10 m/:s or more), snow, rain, and fog.
2. Only fly In opan areaa. Tall buildings and steal structures may affect the accuracy of the on-board compass and GPS signal.
3. Avoid ob-stacles, crowds, high,voltage power lines, treee, $lid bodl$$ of water.

4. Minimize electromagnetic interference by avoiding areas with high levels of electromagnetism, Including mobile phone baae stations,
   radio transmission towers. or WI-Fi hotspots.

5. Aircraft and battery performance are subject to enviror~mental factors such as air density and temperature. Be vefY careful when
   flying 19,600 feet (6 km) or more above sea level, as battety and aircraft performance may not be at peak effici~ancy.

6. Tha Phantom 3 Professional cannot operata In P Mode or use GPS at polar latitudes. Only ATil Mode and the VIsion Positioning
   Byatem will be operational.

· P Mode:

In thle mode, the Phantom 3 Professional can use GPS and the VIsion

The Phantom 3 Professional's flight controller featutas several important upgrades, including a new flight
mode. Safety modes include Failsafe and Return-to-Home. Tl'18St;;j features ensure tha safe return of your
aircraft If the control signal is lost. lhe flight controller can also save critical flight data from each flight to

the on~board storage device.

Three flight modes are available. The details of each flight mode are found below:
P-mode (Positioning) : P-mode works best when GPS signal is strong. There are three different states
of P-mode, which will be automatically selected by the Phantom 3 Professional depending on signa.!
strength of GPS and Vision Positioning sensors :

    P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both ere available. The aircraft is uslng GPS for positioning.
     P-OPT!; Vision Positioning is available but the GPS sighal strength is not ~ufficient. The aircraft is

               using only the Vision Positioning System for positioning.
     P~ATTI: Neither GPS nor Vision Positioning is available. The aircraft is using only its barometer for

               positioning, so only altitude can be stabilized.
A-mode (Attitude); GPS and Vision Positioning System are not ussd for stabilization. The aircraft only uses

its barometer. The aircraft can still automatically return to the home point if the control signal is lost and

the Home Point was recorded successfully.
F·mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this mode. For rnore information
about IOC, refer to the lOC section in the Appe11dix.

 :¢: Use the Flight Controller mode switch to change the flight mode ot the aircraft, refer to the "Flight

         Mode Switch" on P26 for more information.

The low battery level failsafe is triggered when the DJI Intelligent Flight Battery is depleted to a point that
may affect the safe return of the aircraft. Users are advised to return home or land the aircraft immediately
when prompted. The DJI Pilot app will display a notice when a low battery warning is triggered. The
aircraft will automatically return to the Home Point if no action is taken attar a tennsecond countdown. The
user can cancel the RTH procedure by pressing the RTH button on the remote controller. The thresholds
for these warnings are automatically determined based on the aircraft's current altitude and distance from
the Home Point. ·

The aircraft will land automatically if the current battery level can only support the aircraft long enougt1
to desoend from its current altitude. The user can still use the remote controller to alter the aircraft's
orientation during the landing process.

Tha DJI Vision Posttioning System uses ultrasound and image data to help the aircraft maintain its current

po$ition. With the help of Vision Positioning, your Phantom 3 Professional can hover in Place more precisely

and fly indoors or in other environments where a GPS signal is not available. The main components of

the Vision Positioning System are located on the bottom of yol.lr Phantom 3 Professional; they include two

ultrasonic sensors and one monocular camera.
                                                                                            Phantom 3 ProfessionAl User Menu~ I

Using VIsion Positioning
Vision Positioning is activated automatically when the Phantom 3 Professional is turned on. No
further action is required. VIsion Positioning is typically used in indoor environments, where GPS
is unavailable. Using the sensors that are built into the Vision Positioning system, the Phantom 3
Professional can hover precisely even without GPS.

Follow the steps below to usa Vision Positioning:

1. Toggle the flight mode switch toP-mode.
2. Place the aircraft on a flat surface. Note that the Vision Positioning system cannot work

   properly on surfect!s without clear pattern varfations.
3. Turn on the aircraft. The aircraft status indicator will flash green two times, which indicates the Vi$lon

   Positioning system is ready, Gently push the throttle up to lift off and the aircraft will hover in place.

 ,Lh The performance of your Vision Positioning System is affected by the surface over which it is

        flying. The ultrasonic sensors may not be able to accurately measure distances when operating
         above sound-absorbing materials. ln addition, the camera may not function correctly in

        suboptimal environments. The aircraft will switch from P-mode to A-mode automatically if neither

         GPS nor Vision Positioning System are available. Operate the aircraft with great caution in the
         following situations:
         · Flying over monochrome surfaces (e.g. pure black, pure white, pure red, pure green).
         · Flying over a highly reflective surfaces.
         · Flying at high speeds(over 8 m/s at 2 rneters or over 4 m/s at I meter).
         · Flying over water or transparent surfaces.
         · Flying over moving surfaces or objects.
         · Flying in an area where the lighting changes frequently or drastically.

       · Rying over extremely dark (lux < iO) or bright (lux > 100,000) surfaces.

         · Flying over surfaces that can absorb sound waves (e.g. thick carpet}.
         · Flying over surfaces without clear patterns or texture.
         · Flying over surfaces with identical repE!ating patterns or textures (e.g. tiles with same design).
         · Flying over inclined surfaces that will deflect sound wavf;ls away from the aircraft.

  :\): .. Keep the sensors clean at all times. Oirt or other debris may adversely affect the effectiveness
            of the sensors.

         · Vision Positioning is only effective when the aircraft is at altitudes of 0 to 3 meters.
         · The Vision Positioning System may not function properly when the aircraft Is flying over water.
         · The Vision Positioning System may not be able to recognize pattern on the ground in low light

           conditions (less than 100 lux).
         · Do not use other ultrasonic devices with frequency of 40 KHz when Vision Positioning system is

           in operation.

        · Vision Positioning System may not be ablg to stabilize the aircraft when flying close to the

            ground (below 0.5 meters) in fast spe~d.

P-mode (Positioning): P-moda works best when the GPS signal is strong. There are three different
versions of P-mode, which will be automatically salscted by ths Phantom 3 Professional depending on
GPS signal strength and the Vision Positioning sensors:

          P·GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning both are available; the aircraft is using GPS for positioning.
          P~OPTI: Vision PO'sitionlng is available but a sUfficient GPS signal is not available. Aircraft is using

                     only Vision Positioning for position holding.
          P-ATI!; Nelther GPS nor Vision Positioning is available, the aircraft is using only its barometer for

                     positioning, so only altitude is maintained.
A~mode (Attitude): GPS and Vision Positioning System are not used for stabilization. The aircraft uses
only its barometer to stabilize. The aircraft can automatically return to the Home Point if remote controller
signal is lost and the Home Point was recorded successfully.
F-mode (Function): Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) is activated in this mode. For more information
about IOC, refer to the IOC section in the Appendix.
By default, the Flight Mode Switch is locked to P-mode. To unlock other flight modes, launch the DJI Pilot
app, enter the "Camera" page, and tap ''Mode'', then activate ''Mul~ple Flight Mode".

RTH Button
Press and hold the RTH button to start the Return-to-Home (RTH) procedure. The LED ring around the RTH
Button will blink white to indicate that the aircraft is entering RTH mode. The aircraft wlll then return to the
lest recorded Home Point. Press this button again to cancel the RTH procedure and regain control of the
aircraft.

                 Follow Mode constant at all times.

                 FPVMode  The gimbal will synchronize with the movement of the aircraft to provide a
                          first-person perspective flying experience.

.1':::, · A gimbat motor error may occur in these situations: {1) the aircraft is pliil.Ced on uneven ground
         or the gimbal's motion is obstructed (2) the gimbal has been subjected to an excessive

         external force, such as a collision. Please take off from flat, open ground and protect the gimbal
         at all times.
       · Flying in heavy fog or clouds may make the gimbal wet, leading to temporary failure. The
         gimbal will recover full functionality after it dries.

       All unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators should abide by all regulations set forth by government and
       regulatory agencies including the ICAO and the FAA. For safety reasons, flights are limited by default,
       which helps users operate this product safely and legally. Flight limitations include height limits, distance
       limits, and No-Fly Zones.
       When operating in P~mode, height limits, distance limits, and No-Fly Zones function concurrently to
       manage flight safety. ln A~mode, only height limits are in effect, which by default prevent the aircraft
       altitude from exceeding 1640 feet (500 m).

       Maximum flight altitude & Radius Limits
       Maximum flight altitude and radius limits may be changed in the DJI Pilot app. Be aware that the

All No-Fly Zones are listed on the DJI official website at httf2:11flysafe.dji.com/np-:fl;t. NoRFiy Zones are
divided into Airports and Restricted Areas. Airports include major airports and flying field where manned
aircfaft operate at low altitudes. Restricted Areas include border lines betvveen countries or sensitive
Institute. The details of the No-Fly Zones are explained as follow:

Airport

(1) Airport No"Fiy Zone are comprised of Take-off Restricted zones and Restricted -Altitude Zone. Eaoh
    zone features circles of various size.

(2) R1 miles (value of the R1 depends on the size and shape of the airport) around the airport is Take·off
    restricted zone, inside of which take off is prevented.

(3) From R1 mile to R1 + 1 mile around the airport the flight altitude is limited Otl a 15 degree inclines.
    Starting at 65 fest (20 meters) from the edge of airport and radiate outward. The flight altitude is
    limited at 1640 feet (500 metars) at R1 '1-1 mile

(4) When the aircraft enters within 320 feet (100 meters) of tha No-Fly Zones. a. warning massage will
    prompt fmm the DJI Pilot app.

IMPORTANT: Always to calibrate the compass in avery new flight location, The compass is very sensitive

to electromagnetic Interference, which can produce abnormal compass data and lead to poor flight
performance or flight failure. Regular calibration is required for optimal performance,

0 ·Do not calibrate your compass where there Is any possibility of strong magnetic interference.

                  Sources of potential interference include magnetite, parking structures, and subterranean
1:! metal structures

CQ

:::r · Do not carry ferromagnetic materials with you during caJibration such as keys or cellular
                   phones.

                .. Do not calibrate in direct proximity to large metal objects.

· DO NOT calibrate indoors.

Calibration Procedures

This switch, called the Flight Mode Switch, allows you to toggle diffsrent flight modes:
P-mode, or Positioning mode, Indicates that both GPS and the Vlsion Positioning System a(a active and
your Phantom 3 will attetnpt to stabilize using both.
In A~mode, or Anltude mode, the aircraft dOes not use GPS or the Vision Positioning System. Only the
 barometer is used for st<'.bilization. The aircraft can still return to the Home Point as long as a sufficient GPS
signal is available.
 F-mod$, or Function mode, activates Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) functionality. Refer to the fOC
 section in the Appendix of the User Manual.

By default, only P-mode may be used. Refer to your user manual for instructions on unlocking the other

 modes.

What Is the Phantom 3 flight time?

Fllght times will vary depending on environmental conditions and usage patterns, but the Intelligent Flight
Battery is designed to provide up to 23 mlnutes of uninterrupted flight time when fully charged.

How can I restore a video 111& If the power Is turned off during recordlnQ?
Do not remove the Micro-so card from the camera. If It has been removed. place it back in the camera.
Turn the Phantom 3 on and wait approximately 30 seconds as the video file Is restored.

How c::a.n I ensure th~t my pictures and videos will be synchronizad to my lOS album?
You may need to adjust the settings of your mobile device. Open the Settings menu, select the Privacy
tab, select ths Photos tab, and then toggle the switch next to the OJI Pilot app icon. If the Pilot app has not
been granted access to your albums, the photos and videos cannot be synchronized.

Wha.t should I dO to land my Phantom 3 smoothly as possible?
Hover the aircraft over a flat, level surface. Slowly pull the throttle stick down until the aircraft touct1es ths

ground.

Why Is the dlschargl!l time of the batt~ not zero, evan though 1have never used It?
Every battery is tested prior to being packaged and shipped. This affects the dischar'ge time of a new
battery and is the reason that the discharge tima Is not zero. The battery is safe to use.

Ca.n the mobile device hold~r be used on the Phantom 2 series Remote Controller?

No, it cannot.

How to safely operat& the aircraft whan encountering compass errot?
Compass error ma.y occur when the alrcraft is flying close to the $trong electric magnetic sources (e.g.
power transmission lines). Aircraft Status Indicators blink red and yellow rapidly when compass error
occurs and DJI Pilot app will display the one of the following messages:
· Compass error, calibration required

  This warning message indicates the aircraft receives abnormal compass readings. It Is powsr off the
  aircraft and re~callbrate the compass at the different location and resume the flight.
· Compass error, exit P-GPS Mode
  This warning message indicates that the aircraft Is drifting severaly. Bring the aircraft to a higher altitude

  to gain enough GPS locks when this warning massage is prompted. The flight controller will automatically

  adjust the orientation of the aircraft in the midair to mitigate the drifts. Aircraft will switch back to P~GPS
  mode wt1en the adjustment is done.

IOC allows users to lock the control orientation of aircraft in different modes. There are three working

modes for IOC that can be s!!llected in the OJI Pilot app. IOC only works when the aircraft is in F-mode,

therefore the user must toggle the flight mode switch to activate IOC. Refer to the table below:

Course Lock (CL)         The nose direction, at the time that CL is set, will femain ths forward direction
                         regardless of how the orientation and position of the aircraft changes. This will
                         remain flxsd until you reset it or exit CL mode.

Home Lock (HLY           Reoord a Home Point (HP) and enter HL mode. The forward and backward
                         controls will move the aircraft farther from and closer to the established Home

                         Pont regardless of how the orientation and position of the aircraft oha.nges.

Point of Interest (POl?  Point ot Interest. Record a point of interest (PO!). The aircraft can then circle

                         around the POl and the nose will always points toward the POl.

Flight Modes

To avoid &erlous Injury and properly damage, observe the following rule:
1) Do NOT switch from P mode to either A mode or F mode unless you are sufficiently familiar with

   the aircraft's behavior tot each flight mode, slnca dlsttbllng GPS rnay resuH In baing unable to land

   tha aircraft safely.

P mode Is preferred tor most flying scenarios. Users can switch to A mode where and when P mode is

unavailable. Be aware that some features are NOT available for A mode, and therefore be EXTRA cautious
when flying in A mode-

i) P mode {Positioning): P mode works best when the GPS signal is strong. There are three different states

   of P mode, which will be automatically $elected by the Phantom 3 depending on GPS signal strength and

    VIsion Positioning sensors:
    a} P-GPS: GPS and Vision Positioning are both available, and the aircraft is using GPS for positioning.
    b) P-OPTI: If GPS is NOT available. the aircraft will use the Vision Posit!oning System to hover accurately,

        Note that the Vision Positioning System may NOT work properly when the Phantom 3 is flying over
       water, over surfacea without a. clear pattern, or in a low light environment.
    c) P-ATTI: When neither GPS nor Vision Positioning ls available, the aircraft is using only its barometer for
        positioning, so only altitude is controlled.

2) A mode (Attitude): The GPS and Vision Positioning System are NOr used for positioning. The aircraft only
    uses its barometer to maintain altitude. If it is still receiving a GPS signal, the aircraft can automatically
    return home if the Remote Controller signal is lost and if the Home Point has been recorded successfully.

3) F rnoda (Function}; Intelligent Orientation Control (ICC) Is activated in this mode. Ensure you are familiar
    with 100 functions before use.

If you intend to switch to modes that disable GPS as1:listance (e.g., A mode), you are required to accept the
prompted disclaimer to enable this ftmctlon. If this function is enabled, you further understand and agree
that data including but not limited to flight telemetry data and function records could be uploaded to and
maintained on a OJI designated server.

 Failsafe ·and Return to Home

( NOTICg]

1) The Return to Hams feature will NOT work If the GPS signal is insufficient or if GPS is not active.
2) Press the RTH (Return to Home) Button on the remote controller to bring the aircraft back to the Home

    Point instead of turning off the remote controller.
3) Tall buildings may adversely affect the Failsafe function. Please adjust the aircre:ft location, altitude and

    speed while returning home to avoid obstacles.
4) Mak~ sure to always fly the aircraft within the transmission range of the remote controller.
5) When updating the Home Point, do NOT block the GPS signal of the remote controller and ensure the new
   Home Point is correct on the live map.

6) Only use the Failsafe and Return to Home functions in case of emergency, as they may be affected by the

   weather, the environment or any nearby magnetic fields.
7) The aircraft cannot avoid obstacles during the Failsafe RTH; therefore it is important to set an appropriate

    J=ailsafe altitude before each flight.
8) When flying indoors, the aircraft cannot perform precision hovering when flying above the surfaces that do

   not have a clear pauern. Refer to the ''VIsion Positioning System" section for complete Indoor flying criteria.

 Low Battery

( NOTICE ]

1) When the Critical Battery Level Warning activates and the aircraft is descending automatically, you may
    push the throttle up to maintain the ~;~iroraft's altitude and navigate it to a more appropriate location for
    landing.

2) When battery warnings are triggered. promptly bring the aircraft back to the Home Point or land to avoid
   losing powE!r du(ing flight and causing damage 1o the aircraft, property, animals, and people.

 Vision .Positioning System

( NOTICI{.)

1) The Vision Positioning System cannot work properly over surte.ces that do NOT have pattern variations.
   Tha affective altitude for the Vision Positioning System to function correctly is less than 2.5 meters above
    ground level (AGL).

2) The Vision Positioning System may NOT function properly when the aircraft is flying over water.
3) Ke$p your pets away from the aircraft when the VIsion Positioning System is activated, as the sonar

    sensors emit a high frequency sound that is only audible to some pets.
4) Note that the Vision Positioning System may NOT function properly when the aircraft is flying too faSt or too

    low.
5) Operate the aircraft cautiously when in any of the following situations:

    a) Flying over monochrome surfaces (e.g., pure black, pure white, pure red, pure gr~en).
    b) Flying over highly reflective surfaces;
    c) Flying at high speeds (over 8m/s at 2 meters or ov~r 4rn/s at i rneter);
    d) Flying over water or transparent surfaces;
    e) Flying over moving surfaces or objects:
    f) Flying in an area where the lighting changes frequently or drastically;
    g) Flying over extremely dark (lux< 10) or bright (lux> 10,000) surfaces;
    h) Flying over surfaces that can absorb sound waves (e.g., thick carpet).
     i ) Flying over surfaces without clear patterns or texture;
    j) Flying over Sl.lrfaces wlth identical repeating patterns or textures (e.g, tiles with same design);
    k) Flying over inclined surfaces that will deflect sound waves away from tht; airoraft

6) In the event or loss of the remote controller's signal, the aircraft will hover tor 8 seconds and then awto-land
    if it is in ··p·· mode.
Compliance with Regulations & No-Fly Zones

 Regulations

(&WARNING)

To avoid non-compliant behavior, serious Injury and property d8mage, observe the following rules:
1) Do NOT operate In the 'lllclnlty of m~nned aircraft, regardless of altitude. (Land Immediately If

    necessary)

2) Do NOT fly the aircraft In densely popula~ areal!, Including cltiGe, sporting evente! exhlbltlon$,
    performances, etc,

3) Do NOT fly the aircraft above the authorized a.IUtude. Remain well clear of and do NOT Interfere

  with manned aln::ratt operations. ae aware of and avoid other aircraft and obstacles at all times.

(CAUTION)

To avoid non-compliant behavior, serious injury and property damag~, observe the following rules:
1) Do NOT fly the aircraft within, near, or otherwise inside no·fly zones specified by local laws and

    regulations. The no-fly ~one li$t inclwdes: airports, borders betvveen two sovereign countries or regions,
    major cities, etc., and is continuously updated.

2) Do NOT fly the aircraft above tile authorized altitude
3) ALWAYS keep your aircraft within visual line of sight (VLOS), and use an observer to assist if needed.
4) NEVER use tha aircraft to carry illegal or dangerous goods/payloads.

( NOTIG~::::J

1) Make sure you understand the natureltype of your flight operation (such as for recreation, for public use1 or for
    commercial use) and have obtained corresponding approval and clearance from the related government
    agencies before flight. Consultwith your local regulators for comprehensive definitions and spacific
    requirements. For users operating their aircraft in the United States, please first visit http://www.
    knowbeforeyoLifly.org/ and take action appropriate to your circumstances.

2) Plaasi\1 note that remote controlled aircratt may be banned from conducting commercial activities in
    cartain countries and regions.

3) Do NOT fly around sensitive Infrastructure or property such as power stations. water treatment facilities,
    correctional facilities, heavily traveled roadways, government facilities, military zones, etc.

4) Respect the privacy of others when using the camera. Oo NOT conduct survelllance operations such
    as image capture or video recording on any person, entity, evsnt, performance, exhibition, and prop@rty
    without authorization or where there is an expectation of privacy, even if the image or vldoo is captured tor
    personal usa.

( i/OTI¢~ )

OJI always strssses safety during ftlght. and has therefore developed various aids to help users comply with
local rules and regulations while flying. We strongly recommend that you llpdate the firmware to the latest
version to e11sure the the following features are fully updated:

No-Fly Zones
1) No-Fly Zones include but are not limited to major airports around world, borders between two sovereign

   countries or regiona, major cities/region$, etc.
2) The complete list of No-Hy Zones is listed on the official DJI website at http://flysafe.dji.com/no-fly and is

   subject to periodic updates in line with the letest regulatory requirements without prior notice.
3) Some No-Fly Zones are comprised of several zones. Each zone features olroles ot various sizes. The

   aircraft will NOT be able to take off in the Inner most zone of the No-Fly Zone, and will de~cenc.i to the

    specified altitude when it approaches the edge of the inner most zone. Ground station functionality is
   disabled when the aircraft is within a No--Fly Zone.
4) Users are NOT able to set up waypolnts within No-Fly Zones.

AHitude Limit
1) Fly NO higher than 120 meters (400 feet) above ground level and stay away from any surrounding

    obstacles.

If you intend to fly above the default altitude limit, you are required to accept th~;: prompted disclaimer to
enable the new altitude limit. lf a new altitude limit is set, you further understand and agree that data including
but not limited to flight telemetry data and altitude limit changes could be uploaded to and maintained on a
